    "question": "A 39-year-old man presents with a drooping left eyelid. He observes that lifting the eyelid to see results in double vision. He is also experiencing an immediate onset of severe headaches. On physical examination, his visual acuity is normal in both eyes. A left ptosis (drooping of eyes) is noted and the left pupil is dilated. The left eye is abducted in the primary position of the gaze. Testing eye movements reveals difficulty in adduction, elevation, and depression of the left eye. The remainder of the eye examination is unremarkable. Which nerve supplies the eyelid that causes the aforementioned problem?",
