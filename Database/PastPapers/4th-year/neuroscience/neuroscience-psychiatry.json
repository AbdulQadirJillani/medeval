    "question": "An 18-year-old girl presents with complaints of frequent, involuntary motor acts of clapping and head-shaking that have significantly disrupted her daily life for 2-3 months. She also reports having an urge to perform these behaviors to relieve tension and finds temporary relief after doing so. There is no history of substance abuse, and her neurological examination is unremarkable. Which of the following findings would most likely support a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) over a neurological disorder?",
