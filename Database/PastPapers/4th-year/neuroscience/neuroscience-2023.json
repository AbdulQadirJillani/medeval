Furthermore, she is an intelligent girl who understands all of this. Nonetheless, at times, she secretly stops her insulin for no clear external gain like missing a test, and takes in too many carbohydrate-containing foods and drinks that necessitate emergency treatment. Because this behavior is secretive, her doctors wonder what they are doing wrong regarding her treatment.
