    "question": "A 45-year-old male patient presents to the outpatient clinic with complaints of progressive walking difficulty for the past year. Nine months ago he noticed weakness in his grip with thinning of his hand muscles first on the right and then on the left side. There are no sensory complaints or sphincter disturbance. On examination, there is muscle wasting with a power of 3/5 proximally and distally in both lower limbs with brisk reflexes. Asymmetric wasting is present in both his hands with intact reflexes. An oral cavity examination shows fine rippling movement in the tongue. What is the most likely diagnosis of this man's condition?",
