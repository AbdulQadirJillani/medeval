Her examination shows evidence of a left temporal visual field defect. Subsequent anterior pituitary functions tests confirm secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. MRI of the pituitary shows a 4 \u00d7 2 cm cystic calcified parasellar lesion, which is compressing the optic chiasm. The cyst is radiologically described as showing the appearance of engine oil.

    "question": "A 62-year-old man has been concerned about a gradual weight gain over the past 30 years. He is 174 cm (5 ft 7 inches) tall and weighs 91 kg (body mass index 30 kg/m\u00b2). He is taking no medications. On physical examination, he has decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over the lower extremities. Patellar reflexes are reduced. Motor strength seems to be normal in all extremities. Laboratory studies show glucose of 269 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, total cholesterol of 220 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 27 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 261 mg/dL. A chest radiograph shows mild cardiomegaly. Five years later, he has claudication in the lower extremities when he exercises. Based on these findings, which of the following complications in lower limbs can occur in this patient?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman experienced sudden severe abdominal pain. On physical examination, she had marked abdominal tenderness and guarding. Laboratory studies showed serum glucose, 76 mg/dL; calcium, 12.2 mg/dL, and parathyroid hormone, 62 pg/mL (normal range 9 to 60 pg/mL). During surgery, four enlarged parathyroid glands were found and excised, with reimplantation of one-half of one gland. After the surgery, her serum calcium concentration returned to normal. Three years later, she had an episode of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Abdominal MRI indicated multiple 1- to 2-cm mass lesions in the pancreas. Two years later, she now has galactorrhea. Which of the following lesions is now most likely to be present?",
