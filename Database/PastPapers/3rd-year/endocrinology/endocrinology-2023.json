    "question": "A 60-year-old woman has felt a \u201clump\u201d on the right side of her neck for several months. On physical examination, she has a firm 3 cm mass in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy. Laboratory studies show a serum TSH level of 3 mU/L and a T4 level of 8.8 \u00b5g/dL. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is done, and she undergoes a thyroidectomy. A 3-cm solid mass is present within the right thyroid lobe. Six months later, she visited her physician again because of pain in the right thigh. A radiograph shows a fracture of the right femur in an area of lytic bone destruction. A radioiodine scan shows uptake localized to the region of the fracture. Which of the following was most likely to have been present in the patient's thyroid gland?",
