The patient has not had any bowel incontinence, limb weakness, or paresthesias. He has metastatic prostate cancer with known metastasis to the sacrum and left ilium, but has had minimal pain related to these sites. He underwent bilateral orchiectomy two years ago, which was complicated by urinary incontinence. He currently takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits.

In EBRT, a linear accelerator delivers carefully targeted high-energy beams from outside the body at the target tissue. The beams are delivered from different angles in order to spare the surrounding cells. Local radiation improves overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, provides symptomatic relief, and decreases the incidence of pathological fracture and spinal cord compression.","bool":true},{"option":"Spinal surgery","explanation":"Spinal surgery is typically reserved for patients with vertebral body metastases who present with pathologic fractures or spinal cord compression. This patient does not have any clinical symptoms of spinal cord compression, such as bowel incontinence, limb weakness, and paresthesias.

The pain started rapidly after he heard a snapping sound during penetrative sexual intercourse with a female partner. He immediately lost his erection and noticed that his penis appeared to be bent. He has not been able to urinate since the onset of pain. He takes no medications. He appears to be in severe pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows penile curvature to the left from the midshaft. There are significant ecchymosis and swelling at the curvature; no blood is observed at the meatus. The penis is tender to palpation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Intravenous analgesic therapy is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":3,"hint":"A snapping sound followed by immediate detumescence and pain during intercourse, along with examination findings of curving, swelling, and ecchymosis of the penis, indicate a penile fracture.","answers":[{"option":"Retrograde urethrography","explanation":"\nRetrograde urethrography is performed in all patients with suspected urethral injury following pelvic/genital trauma (e.g., penile fracture). This patient developed urinary retention shortly after the onset of penile pain, which suggests a concomitant urethral injury (most likely of the anterior urethra). Urethral injuries are relatively common in patients with penile fractures (occurring in 10–20% of the cases) and usually manifest with urinary retention, blood at the urethral meatus, and/or hematuria. In patients with penile fracture, the presence of any of these findings makes evaluation for concomitant urethral injury necessary before proceeding to other more invasive procedures (e.g., urinary catheterization and surgery) to prevent additional injuries of the urethra.","bool":true},{"option":"Delayed surgical repair","explanation":"Immediate, rather than delayed, surgical repair is the mainstay of treatment for penile fractures, as it allows for functional recovery and minimizes the risk of long-term complications. Moreover, this patient most likely has a concomitant urethral injury and requires additional testing before surgery.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral pentoxifylline therapy","explanation":"Oral pentoxifylline is the first-line therapy for Peyronie disease, which manifests with penile pain, abnormal curvature of the penis, and erectile dysfunction, similar to what is seen in this patient. However, in this condition, abnormal curvature of the penis develops insidiously rather than acutely and patients typically have nodules/indurations on the affected side of the penis rather than edema and ecchymosis. This patient most likely has a penile fracture, for which pentoxifylline is not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Penile phenylephrine injection","explanation":"Intracavernous injections of phenylephrine are used as first-line therapy for low-flow priapism, which manifests with prolonged, painful erection rather than immediate detumescence, and abnormal curvature and ecchymosis of the penis. This patient most likely has a penile fracture, for which intracavernous phenylephrine injections are not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Doppler ultrasound of the penis","explanation":"\nDoppler ultrasound of the penis is a useful diagnostic procedure for the assessment of anatomical lesions of the penile vasculature, such as superficial dorsal vein rupture, which can also manifest with penile swelling and ecchymosis shortly after sexual intercourse. However, superficial dorsal vein rupture is not associated with severe penile pain following a snapping sound, immediate detumescence, or abnormal curvature of the penis.

He started to become sexually active with his girlfriend 3 weeks ago; they use condoms regularly. There is no personal or family history of serious illness and he takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the external genitalia shows no groin protrusion and no penile discharge or lesions. Inguinal lymph nodes are normal. There is a palpable soft, irregular swelling above the left testis. This swelling is more prominent while standing and disappears in the supine position. Right scrotal examination shows no abnormalities. The patient is at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?","difficulty":5,"hint":"Vague discomfort and soft, irregular swelling in the scrotal region that enlarges on standing or with a Valsalva maneuver suggests a varicocele, which most commonly occurs during adolescence.","answers":[{"option":"Testicular atrophy","explanation":"\nVaricoceles can result in testicular atrophy and infertility. The most probable mechanism is impaired spermatogenesis as a result of increased testicular temperature and testicular ischemia (due to increased intratesticular pressure, venous stasis, and/or vasoconstriction secondary to catecholamine reflux from the adrenal gland). The diagnosis of a varicocele is confirmed by ultrasonography, which should reveal dilated pampiniform veins.\nIn young men, semen analysis should be performed regularly to assess sperm number and quality. Most asymptomatic patients do not require intervention. Definitive treatment with laparoscopic varicocelectomy or percutaneous embolization is indicated for those with intractable discomfort and/or abnormalities on semen analysis.","bool":true},{"option":"Testicular cancer","explanation":"\nCryptorchidism, which manifests as an empty scrotal sac, is a known risk factor for a testicular tumor. A palpable lump may be present in the inguinal region if the undescended testis is located within the inguinal canal. In this patient, however, both the testes are palpated within the scrotal sac. Intermittent hemiscrotal swelling with cord-like structures above the testis indicates a varicocele, which is not a known risk factor for testicular tumors.","bool":false},{"option":"Scrotal hematoma","explanation":"A scrotal hematoma can occur following the rupture of a varicocele, but this complication is extremely rare and only a few cases have been reported to date.","bool":false},{"option":"Bowel strangulation","explanation":"The risk of bowel strangulation is increased in patients with inguinal and scrotal hernias, which can manifest as a painless scrotal swelling that increases in size on standing up and on performing the Valsalva maneuver.

This patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient's physical appearance, impulsivity, poor performance at school (a potential sign of cognitive delay), and laboratory results indicating hypergonadotropic hypogonadism are strongly suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome.","answers":[{"option":"Breast cancer","explanation":"Testicular hypoplasia in Klinefelter syndrome leads to decreased testosterone levels, which causes a loss of negative feedback on gonadotropins (e.g., LH, FSH). Elevated levels of FSH stimulate aromatase synthesis, which then stimulates the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This leads to increased estrogen levels, one of the strongest predisposing factors of breast cancer. Compared with the general population, patients with Klinefelter syndrome have been found to have a 15- to 20-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer. Klinefelter syndrome also increases the risk of testicular and extragonadal germ cell tumors.","bool":true},{"option":"Acute leukemia","explanation":"Acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias are commonly associated with Down syndrome (DS). Although this patient's poor school performance may suggest an underlying mild cognitive delay, he lacks typical features of DS, such as short stature, upward-slanting palpebral fissures, a single transverse palmar crease, and extensive intellectual disability. Finally, the patient's other symptoms (such as delayed puberty, gynecomastia) and laboratory results are inconsistent with DS.","bool":false},{"option":"Prostate cancer","explanation":"Rather than an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, patients with Klinefelter syndrome have been found to have a significantly decreased incidence of and mortality from prostate cancer.","bool":false},{"option":"Optic glioma","explanation":"\nNeurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 increases the risk of developing neurofibromas and optic gliomas. Other characteristic features of NF type 1 include café-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules, tall stature, and mild-to-moderate cognitive delay. Although this patient's tall stature and poor school performance may support this diagnosis, he has no other features suggestive of NF type 1. Instead, his laboratory and other physical examination findings are consistent with Klinefelter syndrome, which does not increase the risk of optic gliomas.","bool":false},{"option":"Inferior lens dislocation","explanation":"Inferior lens dislocation can be seen in patients with homocystinuria. In addition to ectopia lentis, patients with homocystinuria commonly present with tall stature and marfanoid habitus. Although this patient is at the 94th percentile for height, his laboratory findings of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and other physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Aortic dissection","explanation":"The risk of aortic dissection is increased in patients with Marfan syndrome due to an underlying connective tissue disorder. Patients have characteristically tall stature and marfanoid habitus; however, testicular hypoplasia, gynecomastia, and reduced body hair are not common presentations of Marfan syndrome. Moreover, Marfan syndrome does not cause hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.","bool":false}]},{"id":4,"info":"Male Reproductive System","question":"A 25-year-old man comes to the physician because of right-sided painless scrotal swelling that he noticed yesterday while taking a shower. He is currently sexually active with two female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He immigrated to the US from Argentina 2 years ago. His immunization records are unavailable. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 5 years. He is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2. He appears healthy and well-nourished. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft with dull lower abdominal discomfort. Testicular examination shows a solid mass in the right testis that is firm and nontender. A light held behind the scrotum does not shine through. The mass is not reduced when the patient is in a supine position. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"A scrotal ultrasound in this patient might reveal disseminated calcifications (starry sky appearance).","answers":[{"option":"Testicular tumor","explanation":"A testicular tumor should always be suspected in patients with a firm testicular swelling and a negative transillumination test. Testicular tumors are the most common solid malignancy in men between 20–35 years of age. Therefore, in this patient, the suspicion for a testicular malignancy is very high and further evaluation is warranted. For further evaluation, a scrotal ultrasound is needed. If suspicion of testicular cancer remains high, a CT scan of the abdominopelvic region and the chest should be obtained for initial staging workup. In addition, tumor markers (AFP, HCG, LDH) should be measured. Patients with a suspicious testicular mass should undergo ipsilateral inguinal orchiectomy after cryopreservation of sperm.\nSee “Differential diagnosis of painless testicular swelling” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Hydrocele testis","explanation":"A hydrocele testis manifests as a nontender unilateral or bilateral scrotal swelling adjacent to the testis. However, a hydrocele is usually elastic rather than firm on palpation, and it does transilluminate.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Varicocele testis","explanation":"A varicocele testis also manifests as a firm scrotal swelling that may cause dull pain and does not transilluminate. Nevertheless, this condition is typically associated with visible or palpable strands (“bag of worms”) rather than a solitary nodule. Most of the time, varicoceles are reduced in the supine position, which decreases the hydrostatic pressure within the venous plexus. The presence of a firm testicular mass that does not reduce upon laying down makes another diagnosis more likely.\nIn contrast to most primary varicoceles, which reduce upon laying down, secondary varicoceles do not reduce in the supine position. Secondary varicoceles are due to compression of the venous drainage of the testicle, which can be caused by tumors of the retroperitoneum (e.g., renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma) or retroperitoneal fibrosis. Secondary varicoceles warrant further evaluation.","bool":false},{"option":"Spermatocele testis","explanation":"A spermatocele testis may manifest as a nontender swelling within the scrotum. However, this condition usually involves swelling of the epididymis rather than the testis, and a spermatocele does transilluminate. Because this patient has a negative transillumination test and a firm testicular swelling, a different diagnosis is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Scrotal hernia","explanation":"A scrotal hernia may cause testicular swelling and dull abdominal discomfort. However, in a patient with a scrotal hernia, a visible or palpable groin protrusion would be expected, which may fluctuate in size and is usually more pronounced in the upright than in the supine position. Also, a hernia would be elastic rather than firm on palpation and may be felt as a swelling extending up the spermatic cord to the external inguinal ring. Since these features are not present in this patient, a different diagnosis is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Orchitis","explanation":"In patients with orchitis, testicular swelling is a common finding. Also, this patient's sexual behavior puts him at risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection that may cause orchitis. In cases of orchitis, though, the scrotum usually appears inflamed (erythema over the overlying skin), the affected testicle is very tender, and patients often present with systemic symptoms such as fever and chills. This patient is afebrile and his scrotum is not inflamed, suggesting a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Epididymitis","explanation":"\nEpididymitis typically manifests with scrotal swelling, and this patient's sexual behavior does put him at risk of developing bacterial epididymitis. But epididymitis is usually associated with severe testicular pain and manifests with dysuria, as well as both systemic (fever) and local signs of inflammation (induration, erythema, warmth). This patient has painless swelling, his scrotum does not appear inflamed, and he is afebrile, suggesting a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Testicular torsion","explanation":"\nTesticular torsion also causes scrotal swelling. However, testicular torsion is generally characterized by sudden-onset, severe, unilateral testicular pain often occurring during the night and typically associated with nausea and vomiting. Clinical findings may include a tender testicle, scrotal elevation, and an absent cremasteric reflex. The gradual onset of the symptoms and the fact that they are associated with dull abdominal pain rather than acute testicular pain point to a different diagnosis.\n","bool":false}]},{"id":5,"info":"Male Reproductive System","question":"A 17-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of progressive left-sided scrotal pain for 4 hours.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient's high risk sexual behavior, dysuria, and pyuria (positive leukocyte esterase) are consistent with epididymitis but his young age, the sudden onset of scrotal pain, and the presence of vomiting and testicular swelling also increase the likelihood of a condition that can result in permanent morbidity if not detected and treated within 6 hours of symptom onset.","answers":[{"option":"Scrotal ultrasonography","explanation":"While epididymitis is the most likely cause of this patient's acute testicular pain, the most dangerous differential diagnosis is testicular torsion. In patients with acute testicular pain, an absent cremasteric reflex is relatively specific for testicular torsion but the presence of a cremasteric reflex does not rule out the condition. For this patient, a scrotal ultrasound is necessary to definitively rule out testicular torsion. If testicular torsion is not corrected early by surgery, testicular ischemia will result in necrosis and loss of the testicle. Scrotal ultrasound is also performed as a part of the management of epididymitis in order to rule out a scrotal abscess, a common complication that may require surgical drainage.","bool":true},{"option":"Surgical exploration","explanation":"Immediate surgical exploration is indicated if clinical features indicate a definitive diagnosis of testicular torsion. Although this patient's presentation increases the likelihood of testicular torsion, the diagnosis of testicular torsion is not yet conclusive at this time because of an intact cremasteric reflex, the absence of a hard and high-riding testis, and the presence of features of epididymitis. A different step in management should be performed first.","bool":false},{"option":"Levofloxacin therapy","explanation":"\nFluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin) can be used to treat epididymitis in older patients, in whom this condition is most commonly secondary to urinary tract infections. Since epididymitis in young, sexually active male individuals is most frequently caused by sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a combination of ceftriaxone and doxycycline is the most appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment for this patient. Moreover, his presentation makes a different step in management necessary.","bool":false},{"option":"CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis","explanation":"\nCT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is typically used in the workup of an acute abdomen. It may also be used in the workup of suspected torsion of an undescended testis.

Orchitis may be a complication of infection with the mumps virus, which can be confirmed by positive serology (e.g., IgG antibody titer). However, in mumps orchitis, a sudden onset of fever is expected. Furthermore, the classic course of mumps infection includes a prodromal phase with low-grade fever, respiratory symptoms, malaise, and headache, followed by parotitis, which is not consistent with this patient's clinical presentation.","bool":false}]},{"id":6,"info":"Male Reproductive System","question":"A 17-year-old boy comes to the physician 1 week after noticing a lesion on his penis.

However, the infection will manifest again after approximately 8 weeks with a diffuse, polymorphic, copper-colored rash involving the palms and soles.","answers":[{"option":"Treponema pallidum","explanation":"\nTreponema pallidum causes the sexually transmitted infection syphilis. In the earliest stage of syphilis (primary syphilis), patients present with a painless papule that evolves into an ulcer with a smooth base and indurated border (chancre) at the site of inoculation, as seen here. Painless, nonsuppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy occurs within a week of the chancre's appearance. If left untreated, the disease progresses after a period of 8–12 weeks to secondary syphilis with generalized nontender lymphadenopathy, polymorphic rash, fever, condylomata lata, and/or patchy alopecia. Finally, tertiary syphilis can cause cardiovascular manifestations (e.g., ascending aortic aneurysm) and neurosyphilis.\nThe presence of characteristic clinical features and positive serology raises suspicion for syphilis. Dark-field microscopy or PCR showing Treponema pallidum in exudate from the chancre confirms the diagnosis. Additionally, the patient should be offered HIV testing and screening for other sexually transmitted infections, as his syphilis infection is indicative of high-risk sexual behavior. Treatment of primary syphilis consists of a single intramuscular injection of penicillin G.","bool":true},{"option":"Trichophyton rubrum","explanation":"\nTrichophyton rubrum is a common cause of tinea cruris, which manifests with pruritus and scaly erythema of the groin and adjacent skin that may worsen with exercise rather than the genital ulcer and inguinal lymphadenopathy seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Neisseria gonorrhoeae","explanation":"While a sexually transmitted disease such as infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae is not unlikely in a sexually active young man, gonorrhea in a male patient would manifest with symptoms of urethritis (e.g., dysuria, purulent urethral discharge) rather than the genital ulcer and inguinal lymphadenopathy seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Chlamydia trachomatis","explanation":"\nSerotypes L1, L2, and L3 of Chlamydia trachomatis cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LV), a sexually transmitted disease that can cause painless genital ulcers and inguinal lymphadenopathy. LV is more common in subtropical and tropical countries, such as the Caribbean, putting this patient at increased risk. However, the ulcer is usually small and shallow and disappears by the time lymphadenopathy is apparent. Furthermore, lymphadenopathy would be quite painful, unlike the painless inguinal lymph nodes seen here. Also, patients frequently have systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and myalgia.","bool":false},{"option":"Klebsiella granulomatis","explanation":"\nKlebsiella granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale, a sexually transmitted infection that is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries, such as the Caribbean.

Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the left testicle when compared to the right and an enlarged left epididymis with decreased echogenicity. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient's combination of unilateral testicular pain and swelling, fever, dysuria, leukocytosis, and a positive Prehn sign (pain relief upon lifting the testicle) indicate epididymitis. Ultrasound findings of increased blood flow to the left testicle and an enlarged epididymis with decreased echogenicity support the diagnosis.","answers":[{"option":"Positive nucleic acid amplification testing","explanation":"The most likely causative agents of epididymitis in a patient between 15 and 35 years of age are Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. If a pubertal or postpubertal patient presents with signs of infection such as urethritis and fever, infection with a sexually transmitted pathogen should be considered even if the patient denies sexual activity. Both infections are diagnosed with nucleic acid amplification testing. Other causes of infectious epididymitis, especially in prepubertal boys or adolescents who are not sexually active, include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses.\nThis patient's ultrasound findings of intact blood flow also rule out testicular torsion, which should always be suspected in a patient presenting with acute unilateral testicular pain. Prehn sign was once believed to be helpful in differentiating between testicular torsion and epididymitis. Nowadays, Doppler ultrasound of the testicle is of much higher diagnostic value.","bool":true},{"option":"Absent cremasteric reflex","explanation":"A cremasteric reflex is often absent in patients with testicular torsion, which mostly affects neonates and boys during puberty and is also associated with acute scrotal pain, swelling, and an elevated testicle. However, a positive Prehn sign, dysuria, and increased inflammatory markers make testicular torsion unlikely. An ultrasound showing intact or increased blood flow basically rules out testicular torsion, which typically shows reduced perfusion of the affected testicle and twisting of the spermatic cord instead.","bool":false},{"option":"A hard testicular mass","explanation":"A hard testicular mass is most commonly seen in patients with testicular tumors such as seminomas, teratomas, and Leydig cell tumors. The mass or swelling of the testicle is usually painless and grows slowly over weeks to months. The presence of pain, dysuria, and elevated inflammatory markers, as well as the absence of a testicular mass on ultrasound, make a testicular tumor very unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Swelling of the parotid gland","explanation":"Swelling of the parotid gland may be caused by infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases (e.g., Sjögren's syndrome), bulimia, or salivary gland tumors. If caused by mumps, orchitis may also occur, which would present with testicular pain and swelling. However, dysuria and the presence of an enlarged epididymis on ultrasound make epididymitis with associated urethritis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Reducible scrotal mass","explanation":"A reducible scrotal mass occurs in patients with an inguinal hernia. These hernias are typically not painful. Painful scrotal swelling in combination with a fever, dysuria, increased inflammatory markers, and this patient's ultrasound findings are not consistent with an inguinal hernia.\nInguinal hernias can become painful if complications such as strangulation or incarceration occur.

Treatment with finasteride results in lower intraprostatic DHT, inhibited prostatic growth, apoptosis, and involution, which can reduce prostate volume by up to 30% in men with BPH and relieve LUTS. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors also reduce PSA levels by approx. 50%, which must be considered when screening for prostate cancer. They are especially beneficial in men with large prostate volumes but may take &gt; 6 months to become effective. For this reason, alpha-1 antagonists are usually preferred for rapid improvement of symptoms.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased internal urethral sphincter tone","explanation":"Decreased bladder neck and internal urethral sphincter tone is an effect of tamsulosin and other alpha-1 antagonists, which are also used as first-line agents in the treatment of BPH. Decreased tone results in decreased resistance to urinary outflow, which in turn improves LUTS. However, finasteride treats the symptoms of BPH by another mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased bladder contractions","explanation":"Decreased bladder contractions and reduced muscle spasms of the bladder and urinary tract are effects of anticholinergics such as oxybutynin or tolterodine. These agents work in BPH by antagonizing muscarinic receptors in the smooth muscle of the detrusor. They are used to treat patients with primarily irritative LUTS (e.g., polyuria, nocturia, urgency, and dysuria) and would not be used in this patient with obstructive LUTS because the decreased detrusor tone could exacerbate urinary retention. Finasteride treats the symptoms of BPH by another mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased penile blood flow","explanation":"\nPDE inhibitors (e.g., tadalafil, sildenafil) act in ED to increase blood flow by inhibiting the degradation of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation, increased blood flow in the corpus cavernosum, and increased penis size during erection. Tadalafil is currently approved for use in the treatment of BPH with comorbid erectile dysfunction (ED), which this patient does not have. The precise mechanism by which tadalafil reduces LUTS in BPH remains unknown, but increased cGMP concentrations in the bladder and prostate smooth muscle are likely to play a role. Finasteride treats the symptoms of BPH by another mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased production of urine","explanation":"Decreased production of urine is not an effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride.

The indication takes advantage of the side effect profile of SSRIs, which includes ejaculatory delay (up to 9 minutes for paroxetine) and orgasm disturbance. In addition to SSRIs, topical anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine-prilocaine spray) can be used to reduce the sensitivity of the penis and thereby decrease sexual stimulation. In addition to medical therapy, behavioral therapy can be offered to patients with significant psychological distress (e.g., lack of self-confidence, impaired life quality) and to those in whom psychogenic factors (e.g., anxiety, depression) play a role in the development of premature ejaculation.\nIn patients with concomitant erectile dysfunction, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) are used first-line because premature ejaculation is often an outcome of erectile dysfunction.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient presents with a solid testicular mass and gynecomastia, which is likely caused by an increased estrogen/testosterone ratio.","answers":[{"option":"Non-germ cell tumor of the testis","explanation":"A solid testicular mass should be considered testicular cancer until proven otherwise. The presence of features of estrogen excess (gynecomastia) in combination with a nontransilluminating testicular mass suggests a hormone-producing testicular tumor, most likely a non-germ cell tumor of the testis (e.g., Sertoli cell tumor or Leydig cell tumor). Endocrinological features of either masculinization (e.g., precocious puberty, temporal hair recession, increased musculature) or feminization (e.g., gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, loss of libido) occur in only one-third of patients. Non-germ cell tumors of the testes arise from the supporting tissue of the testes and therefore do not result in elevated tumor markers (alpha fetoprotein, beta HCG, lactate dehydrogenase).\nScrotal ultrasound can help determine the origin of the mass, i.e., either the testes or adjacent structures (e.g., epididymis). Ipsilateral radical inguinal orchiectomy and histopathology are necessary for a definitive diagnosis. A transcrotal biopsy is not recommended because of the increased risk of tumor seeding into the scrotum and scrotal lymphatics.","bool":true},{"option":"Liver cirrhosis","explanation":"\nLiver cirrhosis can cause hyperestrogenism and subsequent gynecomastia as the cirrhotic liver is unable to metabolize estrogen. Although alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for the development of liver cirrhosis, this patient does not have other clinical features of either compensated liver cirrhosis (e.g., anorexia, weight loss, fatigue) or decompensated liver cirrhosis (e.g., jaundice, pruritus, ascites). In addition, the presence of a testicular mass in this patient makes another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Thyroid disease","explanation":"\nHypothyroidism may cause pseudogynecomastia due to weight gain and deposition of subcutaneous fat in the mammary region. Although this patient has a recent increase in weight, he also has a recent decrease in physical activity (he stopped cycling), and he has no other clinical features of hypothyroidism (e.g., cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin). Moreover, the presence of a testicular mass in this patient makes another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Trauma to testis","explanation":"Testicular trauma can lead to a scrotal hematocele, which manifests with a unilateral nontransilluminating scrotal swelling. However, a scrotal hematocele would not cause a testicular mass and is unlikely to manifest as late as 3 months after the injury. Testicular atrophy (e.g., after significant trauma, or, if a large undrained hematoma has caused pressure atrophy of the testis) is a late complication of testicular trauma that could potentially manifest with gynecomastia. However, only bilateral testicular atrophy would cause gynecomastia due to decreased testosterone production. A unilateral palpable testicular mass is consistent with another diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Adverse effect of medication","explanation":"Drugs that inhibit testosterone receptors (e.g., cimetidine, spironolactone), testosterone synthesis (e.g., finasteride, ketoconazole), or which stimulate estrogen synthesis (e.g., digitalis) can cause gynecomastia. Proton pump inhibitors have also been associated with an increased risk of developing gynecomastia (mechanism unknown). However, the combination of gynecomastia and a testicular mass strongly suggests a different cause.","bool":false},{"option":"Obesity","explanation":"Increased subcutaneous fat deposition can cause painless bilateral breast enlargement in obese males. This condition is known as pseudogynecomastia as there is no increase in mammary glandular tissue.

These tumors are typically slow-growing and manifest with a homogeneously enlarged, nontender scrotal mass that does not bulge with increased intraabdominal pressure (e.g., when coughing) or transilluminate. Seminomas that contain syncytiotrophoblasts can produce hCG, resulting in a mild increase in serum β-hCG (typically &lt; 100 mIU/mL).\nRadical inguinal orchiectomy is often curative for patients with seminoma. Depending on the extent of lymph node involvement, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used as adjunctive treatments.","bool":true},{"option":"Scrotal hernia","explanation":"A scrotal hernia can manifest as an enlarged scrotal mass that does not transilluminate. These lesions are caused by the herniation of the bowel or omentum through the inguinal canal.

These tumors produce large amounts of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). However, unlike this patient, who has a serum β-hCG concentration of 80 mIU/mL, patients with testicular choriocarcinoma typically have concentrations &gt; 1,000 mIU/mL. Because the α-subunit of hCG is identical to LH, FSH, and TSH, patients with high levels of hCG can develop gynecomastia and/or symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which this patient does not have. Moreover, these tumors are rare and often metastasize early to the lungs and/or brain.","bool":false},{"option":"Teratoma","explanation":"A testicular teratoma is a germ cell tumor that can manifest as an enlarged scrotal mass that does not transilluminate. Teratomas do not produce β-hCG, but the presence of an increased serum β-hCG concentration can indicate the presence of additional germ cell tumors (i.e., a mixed germ cell tumor). Compared to other testicular tumors of adulthood, teratomas are relatively rare and not the most likely diagnosis in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Spermatocele of testis","explanation":"A spermatocele can manifest as an enlarged, nontender scrotal mass that transilluminates, and does not bulge with increased intraabdominal pressure (e.g., when coughing).

These lesions are caused by dilation of the pampiniform plexus due to proximal obstruction of the spermatic vein and, as a result, typically manifest with soft, palpable strands that make the affected scrotum appear like a bag of worms. Varicoceles more commonly develop in the left hemiscrotum because the left spermatic vein, which drains into the left renal vein, often has higher intravascular pressure than the right due to compression of the left renal vein by the aorta and superior mesenteric artery.

Regardless of the stage of the tumor, RIO is the first step in management, as it is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of testicular cancer and to classify it according to its histologic subtype (e.g., seminoma, nonseminomatous germ cell tumor). The inguinal approach is preferred, as it permits a high ligation of the spermatic cord that contains the testicular blood vessels and lymphatics. This technique helps minimize tumor dissemination. The testicular lymphatic channels travel in the spermatic cord and drain into the retroperitoneal LNs (e.g., the para-aortic LNs).\nBecause malignancy, orchiectomy, and adjuvant therapy compromise fertility, cryopreservation of sperm should be offered prior to initiating therapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Testicular needle biopsy","explanation":"A transscrotal needle biopsy of a testicular mass is contraindicated when there are features that suggest an underlying malignancy.

Testicular torsion is a medical emergency and is most likely to occur during the neonatal period and puberty. Twisting of the spermatic cord leads to venous engorgement, which may result in arterial compromise and irreversible damage if the torsion is not resolved within 6–12 hours.

Failure of this conduit to obliterate after testicular descent into the scrotum causes outpouching of the parietal peritoneum (and bowel) through the deep inguinal ring, the inguinal canal, and the superficial inguinal ring, leading to an indirect inguinal hernia. These hernias are located outside the Hesselbach triangle, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, and can manifest with a communicating hydrocele, as seen in this patient.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Obstruction of left spermatic vein","explanation":"Obstruction of the left spermatic vein would lead to a left-sided varicocele. Although a varicocele can also manifest as a painless enlargement of the scrotum that increases in size with standing or coughing, an inguinal mass would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Widening of femoral ring","explanation":"Widening of the femoral ring is the mechanism underlying femoral hernias. Although femoral hernias manifest with an inguinal mass, the mass would be inferior to the inguinal ligament and would not cause a hydrocele. Furthermore, femoral hernias most commonly develop in older women (∼ 40–70 years of age).","bool":false},{"option":"Weakening of transversalis fascia","explanation":"Weakening of the transversalis fascia can lead to a direct inguinal hernia. Although direct inguinal hernias also manifest with an inguinal mass, a hydrocele would not be expected.

What should be recommended to any patient taking tetracycline?","answers":[{"option":"Avoid sun exposure","explanation":"One common adverse effect of all tetracyclines, including doxycycline, is an increase in photosensitivity. Drug metabolites interact with UV light, leading to a photochemical reaction with the formation of free oxygen radicals and consequent damage to areas exposed to the sun. Other adverse effects of tetracyclines include deposition in bones and teeth (discoloration of teeth, growth inhibition in children) as a result of complex formation with calcium ions, hepatotoxicity, and damage to mucous membranes (e.g., esophagitis).","bool":true},{"option":"Avoid drinking alcohol","explanation":"\nAlcohol should be avoided in combination with certain medications. While it is wise to avoid drinking alcohol in combination with any antibiotics, this is especially important when taking metronidazole, because the accumulation of acetaldehyde it causes may result in a disulfiram-like reaction, causing severe nausea, vomiting, flushing, and hypotension.

As opposed to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists are not associated with an initial disease flare, so they can be used as an alternative androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer. However, they do not influence the interaction between androgens and their receptors.","bool":false},{"option":"Flutamide","explanation":"\nFlutamide is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor for the binding of dihydrotestosterone and testosterone to the androgen receptor (i.e., an antiandrogen). The inhibition of androgen receptor stimulation prevents the growth of prostate cancer and its metastases. While antiandrogen monotherapy is an option for androgen deprivation therapy of metastatic prostate cancer, flutamide is most commonly used in combination with GnRH agonists (combined androgen blockade). The simultaneous administration of both drugs prevents the worsening of symptoms (e.g., bladder obstruction, bone pain) that may occur due to a transient rise in testosterone during initial treatment with GnRH agonists.","bool":true},{"option":"Leuprolide","explanation":"\nGnRH agonists such as leuprolide are commonly used for medical androgen deprivation therapy in the initial treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. When administered continuously, GnRH agonists cause downregulation of the GnRH receptor in the pituitary, which reduces the secretion of gonadotropins (FSH, LH), thereby decreasing the production of androgens in the testes. GnRH agonists do not, however, influence the interaction between androgens and their receptors.","bool":false},{"option":"Docetaxel","explanation":"\nDocetaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent that stabilizes polymerized microtubules of the mitotic spindle during anaphase, thereby interfering with mitosis.

He sustained a lumbar vertebral injury one year ago following a motor vehicle accident. He takes medication for his schizophrenia but does not remember the name. Physical examination shows testicular atrophy with otherwise normal genitalia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient with schizophrenia is likely being treated with an atypical antipsychotic. These medications can cause hyperprolactinemia, leading to sexual dysfunction.","answers":[{"option":"Decreased testosterone levels","explanation":"\nAtypical antipsychotics can cause erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism due to their effects as dopamine antagonists and subsequent disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Dopamine antagonists stimulate prolactin secretion, which leads to the downstream effects of decreased GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus, decreased LH secretion from the anterior pituitary, and decreased production of testosterone by Leydig cells in the testes. This results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which would explain this patient's erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and testicular atrophy.","bool":true},{"option":"Microvascular disease","explanation":"\nMicrovascular disease is a very common cause of erectile dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and/or smoking history. Microvascular disease causes endothelial dysfunction and decreased levels of nitric oxide, thereby impairing vasodilation of vessels supplying the corpus cavernosum. However, this patient lacks cardiovascular risk factors and presents with testicular atrophy, which would not be explained by microvascular disease.","bool":false},{"option":"Peripheral nerve injury","explanation":"Afferent fibers from the pudendal nerve transmit sensory stimuli from the external genitalia and perineum to the parasympathetic nervous system, where efferent signals are generated to mediate an erection. Damage to peripheral nerves can interfere with this neural pathway and lead to neurogenic causes of erectile dysfunction. This patient has no symptoms of neurologic disorders and presents with testicular atrophy, which would not be explained by peripheral nerve injury.","bool":false},{"option":"Psychologic stressors","explanation":"Psychologic stressors (e.g., depression, previous traumatic experiences, relationship trouble) are common causes of erectile dysfunction.

Immediate drainage of the corpus cavernosum is indicated to prevent ischemia.","answers":[{"option":"A","explanation":"The superficial dorsal vein drains the skin of the penis. It lies on the outside of the Buck fascia of the penis and drains into the external pudendal vein. Because it lies outside of erectile tissue, it is protected from the high pressures that prevent venous outflow during priapism. Aspiration of the superficial dorsal vein would not relieve the symptoms of priapism.","bool":false},{"option":"B","explanation":"The deep dorsal vein drains blood from the glans penis, corpus spongiosum, and the distal parts of the corpus cavernosum.

Under normal circumstances, nitric oxide binds to guanylate cyclase and increases levels of cGMP, a nucleotide that causes smooth muscle relaxation. PDE-5 degrades cGMP, terminating this vasodilatory effect. By preventing the breakdown of cGMP, PDE-5 inhibitors cause smooth muscle relaxation in the penis and increased blood flow to the corpus cavernosum.\nPDE-5 inhibitors can also be used to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with pulmonary hypertension.","bool":true},{"option":"Pudendal nerve","explanation":"The pudendal nerve provides afferent sensory innervation to the perineum and external genitalia, as well as motor efferent innervation to the bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus muscles that are responsible for ejaculation. When stimulated, the pudendal nerve transmits sensory stimuli from the genitals to the parasympathetic nervous system, which leads to vasodilation and increased blood flow in the penis, causing an erection. However, PDE-5 inhibitors do not affect pudendal nerve signaling.","bool":false},{"option":"Pelvic splanchnic nerves","explanation":"The pelvic splanchnic nerves provide parasympathetic innervation to the genitals and pelvis and are also important in development of an erection. Signaling from the pelvic splanchnic nerves to the penis regulates vasodilation and increases blood flow in the penis, leading to an erection. However, PDE-5 inhibitors do not cause splanchnic nerve stimulation.","bool":false},{"option":"Prostate smooth muscle","explanation":"The prostate produces and secretes important enzymes that contribute to seminal fluid and sperm function. The coordinated contraction of smooth muscle cells surrounding the prostatic urethra and ejaculatory ducts is essential for normal ejaculation.

Primary hydroceles differ from secondary/reactive hydroceles in that the underlying cause of fluid accumulation within the tunica vaginalis is not known (idiopathic). In secondary/reactive hydroceles, inflammation (e.g., epididymitis, orchitis), trauma, or neoplasia causes an imbalance in fluid secretion and absorption by the tunica vaginalis.","bool":true},{"option":"Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate","explanation":"Failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate results in a communicating hydrocele and is seen in infants and young children. Although a child with a communicating hydrocele will have the same clinical findings as this patient, the onset of this patient's symptoms in the 6th decade of life makes this diagnosis unlikely. Moreover, in contrast to this case, a communicating hydrocele would increase in size on coughing/straining due to its communication with the peritoneal cavity.\nA patent processus vaginalis is also the cause of indirect inguinal hernia, which can be congenital or acquired and also present as a nontender scrotal mass that may vary in size and, if the content is omentum, absent bowel sounds within the mass. However, since an inguinal hernia enters the scrotum through the superficial inguinal ring with solid content, the examiner will not be able to palpate normal tissue above the mass and the transillumination test will be negative.

To remember which lymph nodes drain the testes, it is helpful to recall their location in early embryological development.","answers":[{"option":"Para-aortic","explanation":"The para-aortic lymph nodes are the most common site of metastasis for testicular cancer. Lymphatic fluid travels up the path of testicular descent through the inguinal canal, following the testicular arteries back to the abdominal aorta, where they originate, near the site of early gonadal development and differentiation of the mesonephros. The kidneys also drain to these lymph nodes.\nUntil proven otherwise, a firm nodule on the testis should be considered cancer.","bool":true},{"option":"Superficial inguinal","explanation":"The superficial inguinal lymph nodes are the primary sites of lymphatic drainage from the scrotum and distal anus up to the dentate line.

This type of defect allows spermatozoa to enter the bloodstream, which are recognized by serum immune cells as foreign, and thus anti-sperm antibodies are created. The antibodies can lead to immobilization and agglutination of sperm or have a spermatotoxic effect.","bool":true},{"option":"Dysgenesis of seminiferous tubules","explanation":"Dysgenesis of seminiferous tubules is seen in Klinefelter syndrome.

Patients with Kallmann syndrome also have associated developmental abnormalities (e.g., cleft lip, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, anosmia). Given that this patient's physical examination was normal and the detection of serum anti-sperm antibodies, Kallmann syndrome is unlikely to be the cause of his infertility.","bool":false},{"option":"Increase in testicular temperature","explanation":"Increased scrotal temperature is seen in conditions such as varicocele and cryptorchidism. It can hinder spermatogenesis and therefore cause infertility.

Urinalysis is the first diagnostic step in all patients with LUTS because it can rule out certain etiologies, e.g., pyuria and bacteriuria are typically seen in patients with UTI, whereas glucosuria is typically seen in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. While urinalysis is usually normal in patients with BPH, it may show hematuria due to increased vascularity in the prostate gland; further evaluation is typically required to rule out malignancy in these patients.","bool":true},{"option":"Uroflowmetry","explanation":"\nUroflowmetry is indicated to quantitatively assess for the presence and degree of bladder outlet obstruction in patients with LUTS.

Most patients with ovotesticular disorder have a female karyotype (46,XX), but approx. 10% of affected individuals have a male karyotype (46,XY) with a predominantly male phenotype, as seen here. Affected individuals typically have ambiguous genitalia, and infertility is common. Patients with a male karyotype typically also present with hypospadias and cryptorchidism at birth and increased glandular breast tissue (gynecomastia) during puberty due to the production of estrogen and progesterone in functional ovarian tissue.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Increased radio-femoral delay","explanation":"An increased radio-femoral delay is suggestive of aortic coarctation, which can be seen in patients with Turner syndrome (45, XO).

This patient's biopsy is suggestive of a difference of sex development that is not characterized by decreased smell perception.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased placental alkaline phosphatase","explanation":"Increased placental alkaline phosphatase would be seen in testicular tumors such as seminomas. This patient's history of cryptorchidism is a major risk factor for seminomas, and an enlarged testicle on physical examination would support such a diagnosis. However, his right testicular pain is not consistent with the usually painless presentation of germ cell tumors, and his biopsy findings are not consistent with the “fried-egg” appearance characteristic of seminomas.

Sensation to pain, temperature, and position sense is absent in the buttocks, perineum, and lower extremities. Ankle clonus is present. An x-ray of the spine shows multiple sclerotic lesions in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?","difficulty":1,"hint":"The presence of back pain, urinary incontinence, muscle weakness, and decreased sensation in the lower extremities is consistent with spinal cord compression. Multiple sclerotic lesions on x-ray suggest osteoblastic metastases.","answers":[{"option":"Elevated prostate-specific antigen in the serum","explanation":"\nElevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are typically found in patients with prostate cancer but can also be seen in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. This patient's age, as well as his clinical and radiological findings, which strongly suggest spinal cord compression due to metastatic lesions of the vertebrae, indicate metastatic prostate cancer.

Although colon cancer can metastasize to the bones and present with osteoblastic metastases, this is not a frequent finding (seen in only 5–10% of cases of advanced colorectal cancer). Instead, the liver and lungs are the most common sites of metastases for both pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma. The absence of typical symptoms associated with colorectal cancer, such as a change in bowel habits, melena or hematochezia, signs of anemia, and/or weight loss, also makes colon cancer less likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Irregular, asymmetric mole on skin examination","explanation":"An irregular, asymmetric mole would be concerning for malignant melanoma.

Chronic anabolic steroid use can result in secondary hypogonadism due to the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (↓ LH, ↓ FSH). This can lead to reduced spermatogenesis and abnormal sperm motility, causing infertility. Small testes, as seen in this patient, are a common finding. Uniform papular eruptions (steroid acne), hypertension, and the very muscular physique of this patient also indicate anabolic steroid use. A low sperm count would support the diagnosis.\nSperm count and testicular size typically return to normal a few months after discontinuation of anabolic steroids, although azoospermia may persist for several years.","bool":true},{"option":"Heat from friction","explanation":"Scrotal hyperthermia is a weak risk factor for infertility that acts by reducing spermatogenesis and resulting in reduced sperm viability. Cycling training requiring long periods on a bicycle saddle can cause prolonged periods of heat due to friction in the genital area, which could be a contributing factor to this patient's infertility. However, this does not account for the patient's small testes, hypertension, and acne. Other causes of scrotal hyperthermia include varicocele and the use of laptop computers on the lap.","bool":false},{"option":"Chlamydia infection","explanation":"\nChlamydia infection, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in the US, can result in infertility. Particularly asymptomatic infections that go undetected can result in obstruction of the ductus deferens and subsequent azoospermia.

In addition, it would not explain the patient's small testes, hypertension, and acne.","bool":false},{"option":"Cushing syndrome","explanation":"\nCushing syndrome is a known risk factor for infertility. Hypercortisolism inhibits the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which in turn results in reduced spermatogenesis. Reduced libido and erectile dysfunction can also occur.

Other diagnostic tests include real-time PCR, which is generally the preferred confirmatory diagnostic test when available because it is more sensitive than viral culture. Serum antibody testing is another diagnostic test for HSV infection, but it cannot be used for primary infections because specific antibodies only develop following seroconversion. Tzanck smear is no longer used in the diagnosis of HSV infections because it has a low sensitivity and specificity and does not differentiate between HSV-1 and HSV-2.","bool":true},{"option":"Serological antibody test","explanation":"Serological antibody test confirms prior HSV infection and differentiates between HSV-1 and HSV-2. This test is not used in active, primary genital herpes infections because patients may present before seroconversion. Serological antibody testing is indicated in patients with a history of genital vesicular lesions who have not had any diagnostic workup or who have had a negative real-time PCR or viral culture. Furthermore, serologic antibody testing is indicated in pregnant women with an active genital lesion in order to classify the maternal infection as primary or nonprimary and to determine the HSV subtype, because these criteria are important for the prognostication of vertical transmission to the infant.","bool":false},{"option":"Darkfield microscopy","explanation":"\nDarkfield microscopy is used to detect Treponema pallidum in primary and secondary syphilis when specimens can be obtained from skin lesions (e.g., primary genital lesion, condyloma).

Additionally, patients with primary syphilis develop nontender rather than painful inguinal lymphadenopathy and usually do not have systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise.","bool":false},{"option":"Giemsa-stained smear","explanation":"A Giemsa-stained smear is used to detect Donovan bodies, which are pathognomonic for granuloma inguinale. This condition causes painless genital nodules that eventually ulcerate rather than painful vesicular lesions like the ones seen in this patient. Additionally, granuloma inguinale is not associated with tender inguinal lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, both of which are seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Pathergy skin test","explanation":"A pathergy skin test is used in the diagnostic workup for Behcet disease. This condition can cause genital lesions, which are ulcerating rather than vesicular lesions like the ones seen in this patient.

If the priapism does not resolve with multiple intracavernous injections (given every 3–5 minutes for one hour), a corporoglanular shunt should be created. Treatment within 12 hours usually allows for complete recovery; delayed treatment invariably results in smooth muscle necrosis, penile fibrosis, and permanent erectile dysfunction.\nBefore discharging a patient with LFP, especially a child or a young adult, a complete blood count must be obtained to rule out hematological disease (e.g., sickle cell disease, leukemia), a common cause of priapism in these age groups.","bool":true},{"option":"Reassurance and discontinuation of sildenafil","explanation":"Reassurance and discontinuation of sildenafil alone are inappropriate in this patient with LFP.

Laboratory studies are most likely to show which of the following?","difficulty":4,"hint":"The location of the testes in the scrotum ordinarily allows them to be kept below body temperature. In patients with cryptorchidism, the undescended testis is exposed to comparatively higher temperatures. While testicular Sertoli cells are particularly sensitive to increased temperature, Leydig cells are not.","answers":[{"option":"Decreased inhibin B concentration","explanation":"\nSertoli cells are essential for spermatogenesis, which is directly regulated by FSH and LH. FSH receptors are predominantly expressed in the Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules whereas LH receptors are predominantly expressed in the interstitial Leydig cells. As a feedback inhibition, Sertoli cells secrete inhibin B to suppress synthesis and secretion of FSH by the pituitary. In this patient with a history of cryptorchidism, Sertoli cell dysfunction would be expected due to temperature-induced damage to the seminiferous tubules, which can result in infertility. Therefore, inhibin B concentration would be decreased and FSH concentration would be increased (due to the loss of the feedback inhibition by inhibin B).\nOrchidopexy is recommended in patients with cryptorchidism between 6–18 months of age to reduce the potential long-term complications of subfertility or infertility and the risk of testicular cancer.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased testosterone concentration","explanation":"\nTestosterone is secreted by Leydig cells under the stimulation of LH. Since Leydig cells are usually unaffected by temperature changes, decreased testosterone concentration is unlikely in this patient with a history of cryptorchidism.

Early surgery promotes normal testicular growth and improves the chances of fertility. Because the infant has a palpable testis in the inguinal canal, orchiopexy is the surgical procedure of choice. Orchiopexy should ideally be performed between 6–12 months, but no later than 24 months of corrected age.\nThe rate of cryptorchidism is higher in preterm infants, such as this patient, and in patients who are small for gestational age or have low birth weight.

Therefore, it is not indicated in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Exploration under anesthesia","explanation":"Exploration under anesthesia is recommended in infants with cryptorchidism and nonpalpable testes in order to evaluate for the presence and location of the testes. A nonpalpable testis may be absent (blind-ending cord structures indicate absent testes), atrophic, or located anywhere along the line of testicular descent (intra-abdominal or within the inguinal canal). Since the left testicle of this infant is palpable in the left inguinal canal, exploration under anesthesia is not necessary.","bool":false},{"option":"Genetic karyotyping","explanation":"Genetic karyotyping is indicated in male infants with bilaterally nonpalpable testes to identify if the condition is due to true bilateral cryptorchidism or a disorder of sexual development (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome). It is not indicated in this patient with unilateral cryptorchidism.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Serum testosterone level","explanation":"Measurement of serum testosterone level is indicated in addition to gonadotropin and Müllerian inhibiting substance assay to evaluate male infants with bilaterally nonpalpable testes.

This procedure involves the collection of 12 tissue samples from different areas of the prostate, guided by transrectal ultrasonography under local anesthesia and prophylactic antibiotics. If prostate cancer is confirmed via biopsy, the tumor is graded based on microscopic appearance using the Gleason score. Some guidelines recommend obtaining a multiparametric MRI of the prostate prior to biopsy.\nTo guide management in patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer, cross-sectional imaging (CT, MRI, or PET-CT scan) is recommended to evaluate local tumor extent, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Cystoscopy","explanation":"\nUrethrocystoscopy may be used to evaluate patients with hematuria for urothelial cancer.

However, patients with a varicocele are typically asymptomatic or have dull, achy testicular pain rather than severe pain. In addition, varicoceles do not typically cause lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, testicular tenderness, or an absent cremasteric reflex. Moreover, this patient does not have typical clinical features of a varicocele, including a sense of heaviness of the affected scrotum, a “bag of worms “ texture on scrotal palpation, and symptoms that worsen with standing or the Valsalva maneuver.

This condition is a medical emergency and most commonly affects neonates, boys, and young men. Twisting of the spermatic cord leads to venous engorgement, with consequent compromise of the testicular artery and irreversible damage if the torsion is not resolved in the first 6–12 hours. Ultrasound of the scrotum can be performed if the clinical findings are ambiguous; if the clinical findings are definitive, surgical intervention is the most appropriate next step.\nIf surgical correction of the torsion is not performed emergently, ischemia and infarction of the testicle can occur. During surgery, reduction (untwisting) of the testis is typically performed in conjunction with orchidopexy of both testes.","bool":true},{"option":"Strangulated hernia","explanation":"A strangulated inguinal hernia can cause severe lower abdominal and unilateral scrotal pain, nausea, vomiting, scrotal swelling, and groin tenderness.

Moreover, this patient does not have a palpable testicular nodule, which is a typical clinical feature of a testicular tumor.","bool":false},{"option":"Hydrocele","explanation":"A hydrocele can cause scrotal swelling. Although one potential cause of a hydrocele is trauma (e.g., from contact sports), hydroceles do not typically cause severe, lower abdominal and unilateral scrotal pain, nausea, vomiting, groin tenderness, and an absent cremasteric reflex.

She has previously used a copper intrauterine device for contraception but had it removed 18 months ago. Ovulation predictor kits consistently turn positive around day 14. Neither of the couple has a history of serious illness or takes medications. They each smoked one pack of cigarettes daily until 1 year ago. The man works in construction and his wife is a secretary for a law firm. Examination of the scrotum in a standing position shows soft bands palpated in the upper pole of the left scrotum with an intact left testicle.

Surgical treatment of varicocele (e.g., microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy, percutaneous embolization) is required in complicated cases (e.g., infertility, pain), while conservative treatment may be considered in older patients. Varicocele treatment has been demonstrated to improve semen quality parameters, which may promote fertility.\nAlthough varicocele is most common on the left side, ultrasound examination of the right side should also be conducted to rule out bilateral manifestation. Following varicocele treatment, this patient's semen quality should be analyzed every three months for at least one year or until conception.","bool":true},{"option":"Surgical excision of the hydrocele sac","explanation":"Surgical excision of the hydrocele sac is the appropriate treatment for symptomatic patients with a hydrocele. While a hydrocele may also manifest as a palpable unilateral scrotal swelling, the transillumination test would be positive.

Palpable scrotal bands are not a feature of epididymitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Inguinal hernia repair","explanation":"This patient's occupation as a construction worker, which is likely associated with extensive physical activity including straining of the abdomen, puts him at an increased risk of developing an abdominal hernia. Smoking further increases this risk, as it weakens the connective tissue. Inguinal hernias that extend into the scrotum may appear as scrotal enlargement and an increase in size during the Valsalva maneuver is characteristic of any type of hernia. However, an inguinal hernia is associated with visible and palpable bulging of the groin and appears as a protruding mass on palpation.

The swelling increases after the baby has been carried and decreases after sleep. These features are characteristic of a congenital communicating hydrocele.","answers":[{"option":"Reassurance and follow-up","explanation":"The scrotal swelling in this infant is typical of a congenital communicating hydrocele, which occurs due to a failed closure of the processus vaginalis during development. This condition resolves spontaneously in most cases by 1 year of age, as the patent processus vaginalis normally closes during the first year of life. Moreover, since this infant's hydrocele is small, it is unlikely to cause pressure-related complications, such as atrophy of the testis or skin erosions. Reassurance and follow-up is, therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.\nThe preliminary diagnosis of a hydrocele can be confirmed by ultrasonography, which typically reveals anechoic fluid. Ligation of the patent processus vaginalis is the procedure of choice for pediatric communicating hydroceles which do not resolve spontaneously by 1 year of age.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Radical inguinal orchiectomy","explanation":"\nRadical orchiectomy through the inguinal region is indicated in cases of testicular cancer, which could present as a lump in one testis that is nontender.

However, drainage is not recommended for congenital hydroceles, since here the hydrocele communicates with the peritoneal cavity and contains peritoneal fluid. In these cases, aspiration brings no benefit, as the processus vaginalis will again fill with peritoneal fluid after the drainage, and hence the hydrocele will recur.","bool":false},{"option":"Surgical excision of the mass","explanation":"Surgical excision of the mass refers to the removal of the hydrocele sac (hydrocelectomy). This would be a valid treatment option for chronic noncommunicating hydroceles. However, the age and presentation of this child are indicative of a classical congenital, communicating hydrocele, which is managed differently.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Ligation of the patent processus vaginalis","explanation":"Ligation of the patent processus vaginalis is the procedure of choice for pediatric communicating hydroceles that do not resolve spontaneously.

In infants, fungal balanoposthitis in association with candida diaper dermatitis is usually a clinical diagnosis and empiric topical antifungal agents (e.g., clotrimazole) are indicated to treat this local mucocutaneous dermatophyte infection. In addition, barrier ointments should be applied 2–3 times daily until resolution is achieved. Further measures to control the local inflammation include sitz baths and avoidance of irritants (e.g., soap, talc powder), as well as counseling on genital hygiene.\nIn prepubertal patients that have balanoposthitis with urethral discharge, diagnostic workup for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is indicated and, if STIs are confirmed, evaluation for sexual abuse should follow.","bool":true},{"option":"Oral amoxicillin","explanation":"Oral amoxicillin is indicated in the case of bacterial balanoposthitis due to group A Streptococci (GAS). Patients with GAS balanoposthitis typically have a history of recent or ongoing GAS infection (e.g., tonsillopharyngitis, perianal streptococcal dermatitis) or contact with an infected individual (e.g., family member). Perianal streptococcal dermatitis typically manifests with bright red erythema most prominent in the perianal area, rather than with widespread pustules and plaques extending to the inguinal creases.
