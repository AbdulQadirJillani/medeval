She has had a 7-kg (15-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. The patient states that she should try to lose more weight because she does not want to be overweight anymore. She maintains a diary of her daily calorie intake. Menarche was at the age of 13 years, and her last menstrual period was 3 months ago. She is on the high school track team. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. She is at the 50th percentile for height and below the 5th percentile for weight and BMI. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 58/min and blood pressure is 96/60 mm Hg. Examination shows fine hair over the trunk and extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This condition may lead to endocrine dysfunction resulting in amenorrhea, low estrogen levels, and possibly anovulatory infertility.","answers":[{"option":"Anorexia nervosa","explanation":"This patient's presentation of a BMI below the 10th percentile for her height and age, fear of gaining weight, and body image disturbance (“not be overweight anymore”) indicate anorexia nervosa, a condition mainly affecting adolescent girls and young women, and often resulting in lanugo hair and secondary amenorrhea. Weight loss is achieved intentionally either through reduced food intake and/or excess physical activity (restrictive type) or by vomiting or laxative abuse (binge-eating/purging type). Severe complications include refeeding syndrome, osteoporosis and stress fractures, electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Anorexia nervosa is also associated with other psychological conditions (e.g., depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders) and a higher rate of suicide.\nThe most important acute therapeutic measure is a stepwise increase in food intake to counteract life-threatening cachexia. Long-term treatment involves ensuring the patient's stable condition through psychotherapy and education.","bool":true},{"option":"Bulimia nervosa","explanation":"While bulimia nervosa also mostly affects young women that are counteracting weight gain and have a distorted self-perception, it is mainly characterized by a normal or increased BMI &gt; 10th percentile for gender and age and generally has its onset in late adolescence or early adulthood.","bool":false},{"option":"Type 1 diabetes mellitus","explanation":"While type 1 diabetes mellitus may also present with weight loss and a thin appearance, this patient lacks further symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. Moreover, the age of onset of type 1 DM is typically before adolescence. This girl's attitude about her body image, menstrual abnormalities, and lanugo hair suggest a different diagnosis.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperthyroidism","explanation":"While hyperthyroidism may also manifest with weight loss and amenorrhea, this patient lacks a goiter and further symptoms of a hypermetabolic state such as heat intolerance (sweating), palpitations (tachycardia), and diarrhea (increased bowel movements). This patient's condition rather manifests with a hypometabolic state, hypotension, and bradycardia to conserve limited resources. Additionally, this girl's attitude about her body image suggests a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"HIV infection","explanation":"While an HIV infection may also manifest with weight loss, this patient lacks further symptoms of an acute or latent HIV infection such as fever, fatigue, myalgia, generalized rash, oral thrush, nontender lymphadenopathy, diarrhea, and/or HIV-associated conditions. Moreover, patients with HIV usually do not fear gaining weight and do not have a distorted body image. Since this patient is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently, it is important to screen for sexually transmitted diseases.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Body dysmorphic disorder","explanation":"Patients with body dysmorphic disorder may be obsessed and concerned with their physical appearance, but the concerns typically involve features of the face or head (e.g., nose size) and not the body weight. Moreover, body dysmorphic disorder does not manifest with significant weight loss and lanugo hair.","bool":false},{"option":"Obsessive compulsive disorder","explanation":"Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) can also present with obsessions and compulsions regarding food intake but are usually not significantly underweight. OCD does commonly coexists with other illnesses such as substance abuse or eating disorders.","bool":false}]},{"id":1,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"A previously healthy 56-year-old woman comes to the family physician for a 1-month history of sleep disturbance and sadness. The symptoms have been occurring since her husband died in a car accident. Before eventually falling asleep, she stays awake for multiple hours and has crying spells. Several times she has been woken up by the sound of her husband calling her name. She has lost 3 kg (6.6 lb) over the past month. She has 3 children with whom she still keeps regular contact and regularly attends church services with her friends. She expresses a great feeling of loss over the death of her husband. She has no suicidal ideation. She is alert and oriented. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"","answers":[{"option":"Normal bereavement","explanation":"This patient is experiencing normal grief in response to her recent loss. Although she has some symptoms (depressed mood, weight loss, insomnia) associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), this patient expresses no feelings of hopelessness or anhedonia. Instead, she has continued to participate in church activities with her friends and keeps in contact with her family. Some depressive symptoms, as well as simple hallucinations (e.g., hearing the voice of the deceased), are a normal occurrence in individuals who have had a bereavement, and care must be taken not to diagnose MDD if the patient does not meet all the necessary criteria. Symptoms commonly resolve within 6 to 12 months.","bool":true},{"option":"Schizoaffective disorder","explanation":"The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that patients meet criteria for a mood disorder (major depressive episode or manic episode) while exhibiting psychotic symptoms consistent with schizophrenia. In addition, psychotic symptoms must be present in the absence of a mood disorder episode for at least 2 weeks. This patient has been experiencing auditory hallucinations after the loss of her husband, but she does not meet criteria for a mood disorder episode or schizophrenia.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute stress disorder","explanation":"\nAcute stress disorder occurs in response to traumatic experiences and classically manifests with flashbacks of the event (especially with triggering stimuli), active avoidance of flashback triggers, and symptoms of increased arousal (e.g., hypervigilance, irritability). Although this patient experienced traumatic loss and has negative mood symptoms as well as mild intrusive symptoms (dreams of her husband), she does not have any of the dissociative, avoidance, or arousal symptoms that are further required to make this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Major depressive disorder","explanation":"\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features can manifest as persistent feelings of sadness with delusions and/or hallucinations, such as hearing her husband's voice. Although this patient presents with some symptoms of a major depressive episode (depressed mood, weight loss, insomnia), she does not have at least 5 of the required symptoms, which also include anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, lack of concentration, restlessness or psychomotor retardation, fatigue and recurrent thoughts of suicide, and therefore does not meet criteria for this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood","explanation":"\nAdjustment disorder with depressed mood is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms that develop within 3 months of a stressful event. To establish a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, the symptoms must cause significant impairment in daily functioning and must not be part of a normal response, which is not the case in this patient.","bool":false}]},{"id":2,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"\nA 27-year-old man with seizure disorder is brought to the emergency department by his girlfriend after falling while climbing a building. The girlfriend reports that he was started on a new medication for treatment of depressed mood, low energy, and difficulty sleeping 2 weeks ago by his physician. She says that he has had unstable emotions for several months. Over the past 3 days, he has not slept and has spent all his time “training to climb Everest.” He has never climbed before this period. He also spent all of his savings buying mountain climbing gear. Physical examination shows ecchymoses over his right upper extremity, pressured speech, and easy distractibility. He is alert but not oriented to place. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of this patient's current behavior?\n","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient's lack of sleep, sense of grandiosity (training to climb Mount Everest), risky behavior (climbing buildings, uncontrolled spending), pressured speech, and distractibility are consistent with mania. Bipolar disorder commonly manifests with an initial depressive episode and thus may first be mistaken for unipolar depressive disorder, as was likely the case here.","answers":[{"option":"Venlafaxine","explanation":"\nVenlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used to treat unipolar depressive disorder. Antidepressant monotherapy (especially venlafaxine and tricyclic antidepressants) in a patient with undiagnosed underlying bipolar disorder increases the risk of developing hypomania or mania. Prior to beginning antidepressant therapy, patients with MDD should be assessed for a history of hypomanic or manic episodes to rule out bipolar disorder.\nDiscontinuation of venlafaxine and treatment with an antipsychotic drug is warranted in this patient. Moreover, following remission of his manic episode, he should be started on maintenance therapy with a mood stabilizer (e.g., lithium, valproic acid). If indicated, antidepressants may be used after initiating mood stabilizers.","bool":true},{"option":"Quetiapine","explanation":"\nQuetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that can be used for acute treatment of manic and depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder and as combination therapy for the long-term treatment of severe or refractory bipolar disorder. This patient was likely prescribed medication for unipolar depressive disorder. However, quetiapine is not used as monotherapy for this condition. Moreover, with the exception of isolated case reports, this drug is not known to precipitate mania.","bool":false},{"option":"Selegiline","explanation":"\nSelegiline is a monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor that can be used to treat unipolar depressive disorder (transdermal application) and Parkinson disease. However, it is typically not used for the initial treatment of depression because of its unfavorable side effect profile. Furthermore, while selegiline can cause serotonin syndrome, it is not known to precipitate mania.","bool":false},{"option":"Bupropion","explanation":"\nBupropion is an atypical antidepressant that inhibits norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake. In patients with bipolar disorder, it carries a low risk of a switch in mood polarity to mania. However, bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and is not used in patients with seizure disorder.","bool":false},{"option":"Lithium","explanation":"\nLithium is a mood stabilizer that is used for acute treatment and maintenance therapy of mania. However, this patient likely received medication for unipolar depressive disorder, and lithium is not used as monotherapy for this condition. Moreover, lithium should prevent manic episodes, not precipitate them.","bool":false}]},{"id":3,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"A 41-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a suicide attempt. His wife found him on the bathroom floor with an empty bottle of medication next to him. He has a history of major depressive disorder. His only medication is nortriptyline. His pulse is 127/min and blood pressure is 90/61 mm Hg. Examination shows dilated pupils and dry skin. The abdomen is distended and there is dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region. An ECG shows tachycardia and a QRS complex width of 130 ms. In addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient presents with prolonged QRS complexes (≥ 100 ms), tachycardia, hypotension, mydriasis, dry skin, and urinary retention. These symptoms are suggestive of an overdose of nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).","answers":[{"option":"Sodium bicarbonate","explanation":"\nTCAs block the fast sodium channels in the myocardium, which decreases cardiac conduction velocity, resulting in prolonged QRS complexes (≥ 100 ms) and cardiac arrhythmias. In cases of TCA overdose involving arrhythmias, IV sodium bicarbonate is indicated to alkalinize plasma so that protein binding of TCAs (weak bases) prevents the drug from binding to the fast sodium channels. Additionally, sodium bicarbonate increases extracellular sodium concentration, which makes the remaining fast sodium channels more active.\nIn patients with TCA overdose, the duration of QRS complexes correlates with the likelihood of developing ventricular arrhythmias and seizures and can, therefore, be used as an indicator of the severity of intoxication.","bool":true},{"option":"Lorazepam","explanation":"\nLorazepam, a benzodiazepine, is the treatment of choice for TCA-induced seizures. There is no role of prophylactic administration of lorazepam in patients with TCA toxicity who are not having a seizure.","bool":false},{"option":"Cyproheptadine","explanation":"\nCyproheptadine has no role in the management of TCA toxicity but is an antidote for serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome manifests with autonomic hyperactivity (nausea, sweating, tremors, tachycardia, hypertension), neuromuscular hyperactivity (hyperreflexia, impaired gait), mental status changes (disorientation to place and time), and hyperthermia in patients taking serotonergic drugs (e.g., citalopram, venlafaxine). Dry skin and hypotension, as seen here, are not features of serotonin syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Atropine","explanation":"Because TCAs have anticholinergic properties, administering anticholinergic atropine to this patient with suspected nortriptyline toxicity would worsen the symptoms caused by cholinergic blockade (urinary retention, tachycardia, bowel distention, dry skin). Instead, atropine is an antidote used in organophosphate poisoning, which results in parasympathetic hyperstimulation that manifests as sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, miosis, bradycardia, bronchospasm.","bool":false},{"option":"Ammonium chloride","explanation":"\nAmmonium chloride is used to acidify urine and facilitate urinary excretion of drugs that are weak bases (e.g., amphetamine). Although this patient presents with some signs of amphetamine toxicity, such as dilated pupils, tachycardia, and confusion, some key features such as agitation, delusions, and hypertension (not hypotension) are missing. TCA is also a weak base. However, TCA toxicity causes profound hypotension, resulting in tissue hypoperfusion and lactic acidosis (metabolic acidosis). Ammonium chloride should not be given to patients with TCA toxicity because it could worsen the metabolic acidosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Glucagon","explanation":"\nGlucagon is an antidote that is used for beta-blocker toxicity. Blockage of the beta receptors in the heart and blood vessels results in profound hypotension and bradycardia in patients with beta-blocker overdose. Glucagon enhances myocardial contractility via the cAMP pathway, which is independent of beta-receptor stimulation. Administration of glucagon is not recommended in the management of patients with TCA toxicity as it would worsen tachycardia.","bool":false},{"option":"Naloxone","explanation":"\nNaloxone is the antidote for opioid overdose. Signs of opioid overdose include decreased respiratory rate, shallow breathing, bradycardia, and miosis, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation. Naloxone causes tachycardia and would worsen this patient's symptoms.","bool":false}]},{"id":4,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"A previously healthy 13-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of a change in behavior. The mother reports that over the past 6 months, her daughter has had frequent mood swings. Sometimes, she is irritable for several days and loses her temper easily. In between these episodes, she behaves normally, spends time with her friends, and participates in gymnastics training twice a week. Her mother has also noticed that her daughter needs more time than usual to get ready for school. Sometimes, she puts on an excessive amount of make-up. One month ago, her teacher informed the parents that their daughter had skipped school and was seen at the local mall with one of her classmates instead. The patient reports that she often feels tired, especially when she has to wake up early for school. On the weekends, she sleeps until 1 pm. Menses have occurred at 15- to 45-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years; they are not associated with abdominal discomfort or functional impairment. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient's behavior?","difficulty":1,"hint":"The patient's age and lack of functional impairment are important points worth noting.","answers":[{"option":"Normal behavior","explanation":"\nPuberty is accompanied by several cognitive, physical, and psychosocial changes. In the early stages of adolescence (onset of puberty 9–14 years in boys and 8–13 years in girls), individuals can experience negative feelings about their self-image, largely due to changes in their bodies and/or social pressure. Irritability (e.g., losing one's temper), mood swings, hypersomnia, fatigue, and infrequently skipping school, all of which are seen in this 13-year-old adolescent, are considered normal as long as they do not cause significant distress or functional impairment.","bool":true},{"option":"Major depressive disorder","explanation":"Pediatric patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) may also present with fatigue, hypersomnia, and irritability. In children, classic symptoms of MDD (e.g., depressed mood, loss of energy) may be less marked but the diagnosis of MDD requires that symptoms be present for at least two consecutive weeks, whereas this adolescent girl's behavior is episodic. She also behaves normally, is active and social, all of which are atypical for MDD.","bool":false},{"option":"Bipolar disorder","explanation":"\nBipolar disorder in adolescent patients often manifests with irritability, and ongoing fluctuating mixed and depressive symptoms, which shift rapidly over hours or even minutes. However, this patient is missing further symptoms of hypomania or mania, such as euphoria, grandiose ideation, rapid, disorganized thinking and speech, and risky behavior.","bool":false},{"option":"Premenstrual syndrome","explanation":"\nPremenstrual syndrome can manifest with irritability, fatigue, and mood swings. However, these symptoms typically only occur before menstruation. According to the DSM-V, symptoms must have been present in most menstrual cycles of the previous year and must be associated with significant distress or interference with usual activities (e.g., work, school, social life). This adolescent girl does not demonstrate symptoms that meet the criteria for premenstrual syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Body dysmorphic disorder","explanation":"\nBody dysmorphic disorder often includes camouflaging of disliked body parts. However, it typically also involves a preoccupation with a specific aspect of one's physical appearance, self-injurious behavior, and social withdrawal, all of which are not present in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Oppositional defiant disorder","explanation":"Patients with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) can also present with irritable mood and loss of temper. However, the irritability associated with ODD is typically chronic (nonepisodic) and affected individuals often show argumentative, vindictive, and defiant behavior towards authority figures such as parents or teachers.","bool":false},{"option":"Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder","explanation":"\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) can manifest with mood swings, irritability, and loss of temper. Symptoms of DMDD are much more severe than the symptoms in this patient, must begin before the age of 10 years, and include extreme irritability, anger, and severe recurrent outbursts of temper for ≥ 12 months without interruption &gt; 3 months. All of these criteria are absent in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Borderline personality disorder","explanation":"Patients with borderline personality disorder can present with affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic irritability usually lasting a few hours–days). However, affected individuals tend to have unstable relationships, display impulsivity, and recurrent suicidal gestures or self-mutilating behavior, all of which are inconsistent with this adolescent girl's presentation. Moreover, borderline personality disorder typically begins in early adulthood, not adolescence.","bool":false}]},{"id":5,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 9-month history of sleep disturbances and restlessness.

He can no longer concentrate in class and failed his last exam. He feels on edge most days and avoids socializing with his classmates because he is afraid that he will fail further exams. He worries that he has an underlying medical condition that is causing his symptoms. Previous diagnostic evaluations were unremarkable. There is no personal or family history of serious illness and he takes no medications. He is sexually active with his girlfriend. He does not smoke. He has a history of drinking alcohol excessively during his early 20s when he first started college, but he has not consumed alcohol for the past 3 years. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. In addition to psychotherapy, treatment with which of the following drugs is most appropriate in this patient?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Prolonged anxiety (&gt; 6 months) about various aspects of daily life (e.g., school, health, finances, family) that disrupts regular activities and functioning is suggestive of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).","answers":[{"option":"Duloxetine","explanation":"\nDuloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is considered a first-line treatment option for GAD. SNRIs are effective anxiolytics with no potential for dependence, and they have a more favorable side-effect profile than second and third-line options. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also an alternative first-line drug. Although symptoms generally begin to improve within 4–6 weeks of initiating SNRIs/SSRIs, some patients may experience agitation and insomnia during this time period. A 4–6 week course of a sedating antihistamine, gabapentin, or a benzodiazepine (in those without a history of substance use disorder) may be considered in these patients. Second-line therapies for GAD include augmentation of an SNRI/SSRI with buspirone or gabapentin (if there was a partial initial response to first-line treatment) or switching to a different SNRI/SSRI (if there was no response to initial treatment).\nPatients taking SSRIs or SNRIs may experience sexual dysfunction, which is important to consider in this sexually active man. Studies have shown that SNRIs (with the exception of venlafaxine) cause fewer sexual side effects when compared to SSRIs, therefore duloxetine may be an appropriate first-line treatment option in sexually active patients.","bool":true},{"option":"Doxepin","explanation":"\nDoxepin and other tricyclic antidepressants can be used in the treatment of GAD. However, they are no longer considered the first-line treatment due to their negative side-effect profile (e.g., anticholinergic symptoms) and risk of overdose.","bool":false},{"option":"Mirtazapine","explanation":"\nMirtazapine is primarily used in the treatment of major depressive disorder, and possibly as a third-line treatment option in GAD. Mirtazapine causes sedation, which can be beneficial in patients with insomnia. Also, this medication does not usually result in sexual side effects. However, mirtazapine is not as effective as first-line treatment options and has numerous other adverse effects (e.g., weight gain, dry mouth, excessive sedation) that often lead to patients discontinuing it.","bool":false},{"option":"Lorazepam","explanation":"\nLorazepam, a benzodiazepine, can be used as an adjunctive medication in the treatment of GAD. While effective in improving symptoms such as agitation and insomnia in the short term, benzodiazepines should never be used in long-term management because of their high potential for addiction and negative side-effect profile. In this patient, the history of risky alcohol use puts him at increased risk of developing dependence and abuse; therefore, this class of medications should be avoided.","bool":false},{"option":"Propranolol","explanation":"\nPropranolol can be used as an adjunctive medication in the primary treatment of panic disorder, which typically presents with recurrent, unexpected panic attacks in which the patient experiences intense episodes of fear and discomfort, overstimulation of the sympathetic system (e.g., sweating, palpitations), and concern for future attacks. This patient's symptoms, however, are not consistent with panic disorder.","bool":false},{"option":"Pregabalin","explanation":"\nPregabalin can be used in the treatment of GAD. However, it is considered an alternative treatment option that can either be used alone or as an augmenting agent in patients who have only a partial response to first-line treatment.","bool":false},{"option":"Buspirone","explanation":"\nBuspirone can be used in the treatment of GAD.

This is consistent with MDD with peripartum onset.","answers":[{"option":"Paroxetine therapy","explanation":"\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine, are the first-line treatment for patients with MDD. In addition, SSRIs are approved for patients with postpartum depression as they are safe to use while breastfeeding. It may take 4–6 weeks to see any symptom reduction; if no improvement is seen after this time, it is reasonable to increase the dose, transition to another SSRI, or switch to a different drug class. Psychological and behavioral therapy should also be recommended for this patient, as the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is more efficacious than either one alone.","bool":true},{"option":"Reassurance","explanation":"Reassurance is appropriate for patients with postpartum blues, which typically manifests with mild depressive symptoms (e.g., depressed mood, lethargy, anxiety, exhaustion, insomnia) within 1 week of delivery and resolves spontaneously within 2 weeks.

Patients taking SSRIs may not see a reduction in symptoms until 4–6 weeks after therapy is initiated. If no improvement is seen after this time, it is reasonable to increase the dose, switch therapy to another SSRI, or switch therapy to another drug class (selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, atypical antidepressants, or trazodone). Tricyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors are usually reserved as third- or fourth-line treatment for refractory MDD. Psychotherapy should also be initiated, as the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is more efficacious than either one alone.","bool":true},{"option":"Amitriptyline therapy","explanation":"\nAmitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and third-line agent for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":1,"hint":"While hallucinations may be caused by dysregulation of a variety of neurotransmitters, this patient's symptoms are most likely due to an activation of dopamine D2-receptors.","answers":[{"option":"Adverse effect of medication","explanation":"\nLevodopa (L-DOPA), a dopamine precursor, is the most effective medication for controlling the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease. Primary effects of L-DOPA are achieved by stimulating D2-receptors in the substantia nigra and striatum. However, overstimulation of D2-receptors by levodopa may also induce psychosis and hallucinations (usually visual). The risk for developing psychiatric symptoms increases with age, other psychiatric conditions, long duration of levodopa treatment, and high doses. Since this patient has been taking levodopa for 3 years and is elderly, her symptoms are most likely the result of levodopa therapy.\nOther adverse effects of L-DOPA therapy include dizziness, somnolence or insomnia, anxiety, and aggressive behavior.","bool":true},{"option":"Alcohol withdrawal","explanation":"\nAlcohol withdrawal occurs in individuals with alcohol use disorder shortly after a complete cessation of alcohol consumption (i.e., within 24 hours). Common clinical manifestations are mild (e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, insomnia) but more severe findings (e.g., seizure, hallucinations, impaired consciousness) may also develop.

Patients with RAD also show minimal social responsiveness to others, which is reflected in this child's lack of involvement in cooperative play with other children. Repeated changes in foster care limit the opportunity to form selective attachments and are a risk factor for this condition. Other risk factors include child abuse and neglect.

The onset of symptoms is usually sudden (without a prodrome) and the functional impairment can be severe. After the episode, individuals gradually return to the premorbid state. Although this patient currently meets the diagnostic criteria for this condition, psychiatric diagnoses are dynamic, changing depending on the duration of symptoms and whether new symptoms arise.

Its key features are reduced vocabulary for age, incorrect understanding of a word's meaning, limited ability to string words together to form complete sentences, and/or incorrect grammar use. These features impair the patient's ability to speak and write (expressive LD) as well as understand (receptive LD), which leads to irritability and frustration, reluctance to engage in conversations, inability to follow instructions without visual cues, and, eventually, difficulties in social participation and academic performance. The diagnosis is typically confirmed after the age of 4 years, at which point children should have a vocabulary of approx. 1500 words, be able to form 4–5 word sentences, and use certain grammatical structures (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, tense) correctly. In patients with language disorder, speech fluency is unaffected and speech remains intelligible.

Improving medication adherence is critical to preventing future complications.","answers":[{"option":"Schedule more frequent follow-up visits","explanation":"This patient's poor medication adherence is the most likely cause of her poorly-controlled diabetes, but the cause of her nonadherence is unclear at this point. Employing strategies that aim to strengthen the doctor-patient relationship and therapeutic alliance, such as scheduling frequent follow-up visits, and a patient-centered approach often improve patients' medication adherence. Frequent follow-up visits also enable closer monitoring of the patient's medication use. Other strategies to improve medication adherence include providing written instructions, optimizing the treatment plan (e.g., prescribing once-daily scheduled medications when possible), and using the teach-back method.","bool":true},{"option":"Refer the patient to an endocrinologist","explanation":"Referring the patient to an endocrinologist is indicated if primary management strategies are unsuccessful or if the primary physician feels that managing this patient's condition and/or complications of her underlying disease exceed the level of his or her expertise. However, referral of this patient to an endocrinologist is not indicated at this time, since the elevated HbA1c is most likely due to poor medication adherence, which is well within the bounds of what can be expected of a primary physician.","bool":false},{"option":"Stop metformin and begin an insulin regimen","explanation":"Starting insulin should be considered if there is concern that metformin is inadequate for the treatment of this patient's diabetes. However, this patient reports poor medication adherence to metformin; control over her diabetes may improve after addressing this issue. Moreover, dosing for insulin therapy is more complicated than that for metformin therapy; inappropriate use of insulin can be dangerous due to the risk of inducing hypoglycemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Add glyburide to the medication regimen","explanation":"The addition of glyburide, a sulfonylurea, is indicated if there is concern that monotherapy with metformin is inadequate for treatment of this patient's diabetes. However, this patient reports poor medication adherence; the addition of another agent is not indicated and may worsen adherence by complicating the medication regimen.","bool":false},{"option":"Refer the patient to a dietician","explanation":"A referral to a registered dietician could be helpful in addressing this patient's obesity, and a low-carbohydrate, low-fat diet should be recommended to prevent cardiovascular disease and improve diabetic control.

Ataxia, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and slurred speech are common features. In contrast to opioid overdose, respiratory depression is usually mild and patients do not have constricted pupils. Supportive care with monitoring is the treatment of choice. The antidote flumazenil carries a high risk of seizures and is only used in certain situations, such as severe respiratory depression, accidental ingestion by benzodiazepine-naive children, and the reversal of procedural sedation in benzodiazepine-naive adults.","bool":true},{"option":"Opioid overdose","explanation":"\nOpioid overdose can cause altered mental status and somnolence.

As this is the first antidepressive medication being prescribed to the patient, another pharmacotherapy should be tried first. Although this class of antidepressants is particularly effective at treating symptoms of atypical depression, including weight gain, this patient's sudden weight gain is likely due to his attempt to quit smoking rather than depression. In addition, MAO inhibitors have potentially life-threatening side effects, including hypertensive crisis secondary to ingestion of foods containing tyramine (e.g., aged cheeses, smoked/cured meats, alcoholic beverages).","bool":false},{"option":"Valproic acid","explanation":"\nValproic acid is primarily used as an anticonvulsant to treat epilepsy and as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disease. It is not an effective antidepressant, nor does it aid in smoking cessation.","bool":false},{"option":"Amitriptyline","explanation":"\nAmitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant, a class of agents that are the third- or fourth-line treatment for MDD because of their severe side effects, which include anticholinergic symptoms, such as hypotension, arrhythmias and wide QRS complex, and potential risk of lethal overdose.

The most appropriate next step in treatment is the administration of which of the following?\n","difficulty":2,"hint":"The patient's symptoms of chest pain, diaphoresis, agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and mydriasis in the setting of recent exam studying and insomnia suggest stimulant intoxication, most likely due to amphetamine use.","answers":[{"option":"Midazolam","explanation":"Patients with symptomatic stimulant intoxication (e.g., amphetamine overdose, cocaine overdose) should be treated with benzodiazepines such as midazolam. Benzodiazepines provide a sedative effect, help control hypertension, and prevent seizures. Patients who are febrile should also be cooled externally. In this patient with symptoms of cardiac ischemia, antihypertensives such as nitroprusside or phentolamine should also be administered if blood pressure does not decrease with the administration of benzodiazepines.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Activated charcoal","explanation":"\nActivated charcoal is not very useful more than 1–2 hours after the ingestion of a toxic substance. Moreover, activated charcoal requires oral administration, which is generally contraindicated in agitated or drowsy patients due to the risk of aspiration.","bool":false},{"option":"Ketamine","explanation":"\nKetamine is typically used to sedate patients prior to rapid sequence intubation or as an emergency anesthetic for polytrauma patients with risk of hypotension. In this patient, intubation or anesthesia is not indicated. Moreover, ketamine can further elevate the blood pressure and heart rate and is, therefore, contraindicated in patients with hypertension and tachycardia.","bool":false},{"option":"Haloperidol","explanation":"\nAntipsychotics such as haloperidol should generally be avoided in patients with suspected stimulant intoxication because they can interfere with heat dissipation, prolong the QTc interval, and potentially decrease the seizure threshold.","bool":false},{"option":"Dantrolene","explanation":"\nDantrolene is not used to treat stimulant intoxication. Instead, it is used to treat neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or malignant hyperthermia, which can result in increased body temperature, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, and altered mental status. NMS typically occurs with antipsychotic medications, and malignant hyperthermia occurs following the administration of volatile anesthetics or muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine. The body temperature would usually be extremely high (&gt; 41°C) and mydriasis would not be expected in either of these conditions.","bool":false},{"option":"Propranolol","explanation":"In patients with stimulant overdose, catecholamine surge causes vasoconstriction mediated through alpha-1 receptor stimulation.

He filed for bankruptcy 2 months ago for a business he had owned with his brother until his brother died of skin cancer a year ago. He has tried to hide his financial issues from his wife and explains that he is feeling increasingly desperate and no longer “sees the light at the end of the tunnel.” He worries about finances and what would happen if he developed cancer like his brother, and then cannot fall asleep. In the morning, he feels tired and finds it hard to start the day. The patient says the symptoms began a few months after his brother's death and then, “Everything started to fall apart. I can't concentrate, my wife will probably leave me soon, and now I have lost the business.” Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction by the physician?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient, who presents with a depressed mood, sleep disturbance, fatigue, diminished concentration, and weight loss over a period &gt; 2 weeks, is experiencing a major depressive episode.","answers":[{"option":"\"I cannot imagine how hard this must be for you. You say you no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel. Are you having thoughts of suicide?\"","explanation":"Through this reaction, the physician shows empathy and specifically asks about suicidal ideation. Assessing a patient's suicide risk is the most important diagnostic step for any depressed individual. If the patient confirms that he is having suicidal ideation, the physician should also ask the patient if he has thought of a means of suicide (suicidal plan), assess the degree to which he intends to put the plan into action (suicidal intent), and evaluate whether additional risk factors for suicide completion are present (e.g., possession of a firearm, personal and family history of prior suicide attempts). If the patient is suicidal, they should be admitted to the hospital. Treatment of a major depressive episode often requires a combination of antidepressants, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes.","bool":true},{"option":"\"Losing your brother must have been extremely hard for you. Would you be willing to speak with a grief counselor?\"","explanation":"A referral to a grief counselor is appropriate for the management of grief, which is caused by the death of a loved one and can present with symptoms such as a depressed mood, disturbed sleep, and decreased concentration, as seen here. However, the symptoms of grief tend to occur in waves (grief pangs), decrease over time, and are not associated with functional impairment or feelings of desperation. This patient's presentation is consistent with a major depressive episode and cannot be treated by grief counseling alone. Moreover, even in patients with grief, it is important to first ask a specific question in order to differentiate normal from pathological grief.","bool":false},{"option":"\"It sounds like you are depressed, but before we begin treatment for depression, I would like to evaluate you for any underlying conditions that may be causing your mood changes.\"","explanation":"Depression can be caused by organic conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, CNS neoplasm, Parkinson disease), and it is necessary to evaluate patients with features of depression for organic disease.

You will see that things will become easier for you over time!\"","explanation":"Through this reaction, the physician minimizes the patient's symptoms. Although it could be normal for the patient to occasionally have some of his symptoms (e.g., depressed mood, decreased sleep, decreased concentration) as a part of grief, it is not normal to have them on a persistent basis or have unexplained weight loss over 8 months. Moreover, by saying, “You will see that things will become easier for you over time!\" the physician is making promises that cannot be guaranteed.","bool":false},{"option":"\"After the death of your brother, it is even more important to stay close to your family.

Antipsychotics, which primarily inhibit D2 receptors, are effective in alleviating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia by decreasing the dopaminergic activity in this pathway. Antipsychotics are less effective at treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., apathy, flat affect, avolition), which are primarily caused by decreased dopaminergic activity in the mesocortical pathway. The adverse effects of antipsychotics include parkinsonism and hyperprolactinemia, which are caused by the antagonistic effects of antipsychotics on the dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways, respectively. The mesolimbic pathway plays an important role in reward- and aversion-related cognition, and dysfunction in this pathway is also implicated in the pathophysiology of substance use disorders.\nThe antiserotonergic activity of atypical antipsychotics and findings in patients with schizophrenia such as decreased levels of glutamate decarboxylase (GABA-producing enzyme) in the hippocampus and decreased expression of NMDA receptors suggest that neurotransmitters other than dopamine may also be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, the exact role of these neurotransmitters is unclear.","bool":true},{"option":"Hypoactivity in nigrostriatal projections","explanation":"\nDopamine release in the nigrostriatal projections modulates motor activity and certain cognitive functions.

Monoamine oxidase breaks down excess tyramine in the body. Since MAOIs block this enzyme, the consumption of tyramine-rich foods (e.g., red wine, certain nuts, aged cheeses or meats, dried fruits) leads to an accumulation of tyramine. This, in turn, leads to a release of norepinephrine that can provoke a hypertensive crisis, as seen in this patient.","bool":true},{"option":"Almotriptan","explanation":"\nAlmotriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist, is typically used as an abortive therapy for migraine headache.

Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant used to treat major depressive disorder and can help relieve cravings and withdrawal symptoms in individuals who are trying to quit smoking.","answers":[{"option":"Tachycardia","explanation":"\nBupropion inhibits neuronal dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake. Reuptake inhibition not only increases the levels of these substances in the synapse (which is responsible for the drug's effect on mood and ability to alleviate nicotine cravings) but also in peripheral circulation. Bupropion can therefore cause stimulant effects such as tachycardia, insomnia, weight loss, and reduction in the seizure threshold. The risk of tachycardia is dose-related and higher doses of the drug can even predispose patients to cardiac arrhythmias.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased libido","explanation":"Decreased libido is a common side effect of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and one of the most common reasons for discontinuation of SSRIs. Bupropion is commonly prescribed to patients experiencing decreased libido due to SSRI therapy, as it does not cause this side effect.","bool":false},{"option":"Weight gain","explanation":"Weight gain is not associated with bupropion use.

Avoidant personality disorder is not characterized by symptoms of panic attacks (dyspnea, chest tightness, palpitations, dizziness, diaphoresis, and a feeling of impending doom).","bool":false},{"option":"Separation anxiety disorder","explanation":"Patients with separation anxiety disorder have distressing symptoms due to a fear of separation from home or from a person to whom they are attached, and they may refuse to leave home by themselves. These symptoms can last for ≥ 6 months. However, the cause of distressing symptoms in a patient with separation anxiety disorder is a fear of death or harm befalling the attachment figure, not a fear of being alone when the distressing symptoms occur.","bool":false},{"option":"Social anxiety disorder","explanation":"Patients with social anxiety disorder have episodes of distressing symptoms over a period of ≥ 6 months and may confine themselves to their homes. The distressing symptoms arise from a fear of being viewed negatively by others and typically occur during social interactions (e.g., meeting new people), when performing in front of others (e.g., public speaking), and/or when feeling observed (e.g., using public restrooms, eating or drinking in public). The triggers for this patient's symptoms are not typical of patients with social anxiety disorder. Moreover, symptoms of social anxiety disorder are not alleviated when patients are accompanied by an attachment figure, whereas this patient's symptoms are not present when she is accompanied by her boyfriend.","bool":false}]},{"id":51,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician because her mother has found her to be inattentive at home and has received multiple complaints from her teachers at school.

Her mother says, “She ignores everything I say to her!” She prefers playing alone, and her mother reports that she likes playing with 5 red toy cars, repeatedly arranging them in a straight line. She avoids eye contact with her mother and the physician throughout the visit. Physical and neurological examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"Early intervention programs can improve communication and social skills for patients with this disorder.","answers":[{"option":"Autism spectrum disorder","explanation":"Although clinical presentation varies widely, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairment in social interaction and restrictive patterns of behavior or interests. This patient's trouble communicating, inattentiveness, refusal to speak and make eye contact, fixation on and intense attachment to certain objects (red toy cars), and repeated actions are all behaviors typically seen in patients with ASD. While the exact cause of ASD is unknown, twin studies strongly suggest a genetic predisposition.\nTreatment of ASD, which should be initiated early, involves educational and behavioral management (e.g., competence training for social skills and communication skills), family counseling, and medical therapy (e.g., SSRIs for repetitive stereotyped behavior).","bool":true},{"option":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","explanation":"Like the patient here, patients with ADHD typically present with difficulties paying attention and have poor academic performance. However, ADHD is also characterized by impulsiveness and hyperactivity, which are not present in this patient. Moreover, language problems such as maladaptive speech, repetitive/stereotyped behavior, and fixated interests suggest a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Conduct disorder","explanation":"This patient's behavior does not meet the diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder, which include aggression (e.g., arguing with teachers, cruelty to animals), propensity to criminal behavior (e.g., destruction of property and theft), and serious rule violation. While this patient's behavior could be interpreted as defiant and she does have problems at school, her behavior is neither aggressive nor deceitful, and she has not engaged in property damage or seriously violated any rules.","bool":false},{"option":"Age-appropriate behavior","explanation":"Children with normal language development speak in three-word sentences by age 3 and recount complex stories by age 4. This patient's behavior is not normal for a 5-year-old child. Being inattentive, ignoring what other people say, and preferring to play alone might be age-appropriate to a certain degree. However, this patient's avoidance of eye contact, refusal to speak, and frequent repetition of specific actions point to a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Rett syndrome","explanation":"Patients with Rett syndrome initially meet developmental milestones before experiencing a progressive loss of cognitive and fine motor skills beginning at 7–24 months of age. Pronounced verbal disability is common, and patients may show characteristic hand wringing. Although this patient refuses to speak, her fine motor skills are developmentally appropriate and her history is not consistent with developmental regression.","bool":false},{"option":"Hearing impairment","explanation":"A child with hearing impairment may appear to be inattentive or unresponsive when spoken to. However, a diagnosis of hearing impairment would not explain the other features of this patient's behavioral pattern, including her refusal to speak or make eye contact, her intense attachment to certain specific objects (red toy cars), and the frequent repetition of specific actions. She also has no history of the most common risk factors for childhood hearing loss (ear infections, malformations, obstructions, or ototoxic drug intake).","bool":false},{"option":"Fragile X syndrome","explanation":"\nFragile X syndrome presents with intellectual disability, language delay, and characteristic physical features, including large ears and a thin, elongated face. It predominantly affects male patients, as heterozygous female carriers of the defective FMR1 gene can compensate for the defect if their second X chromosome is normal. Although this patient's refusal to speak could be a sign of language delay, the fact that she is female and has normal physical examination findings make this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Oppositional defiant disorder","explanation":"\nOppositional defiant disorder is characterized by anger, irritable mood, and defiant behavior toward figures of authority, which may also cause problems at school, for ≥ 6 months.

Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?","difficulty":1,"hint":"The patient shows signs of confabulation and has marked deficits in short-term memory, while his long-term memory and other cognitive skills appear to be intact. Atrophic lesions in the anterior thalami and small mammillary bodies support a diagnosis of Korsakoff syndrome.","answers":[{"option":"Alcohol use disorder","explanation":"\nKorsakoff syndrome occurs due to chronic thiamine deficiency and in the developed world is most commonly due to underlying alcohol use disorder. Thiamine plays an important role as a cofactor in cerebral glucose metabolism, myelin sheath maintenance, and synthesis of neurotransmitters. Disruption of these processes due to thiamine deficiency results in impaired axonal conduction and causes the characteristic features of both Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. Atrophy of the mammillary bodies is a relatively specific indicator of Korsakoff syndrome.","bool":true},{"option":"Intravenous heroin use","explanation":"Intravenous heroin use can lead to infective endocarditis, the complications of which include cerebral septic emboli, meningitis, and brain abscess. Depending on the affected brain regions, neurological deficits of varying severity may be present.

Brain imaging would reveal acute inflammation, emboli, or ring-enhancing lesions as opposed to the localized atrophy seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Spirochete infection","explanation":"Without treatment, syphilis infection can progress to neurosyphilis, the manifestations of which are highly variable. Late neurosyphilis usually involves the brain and spinal cord parenchyma, causing weakness, progressive dementia, personality changes, as well as tabes dorsalis. This patient's lack of dysarthria, facial and limb hypotonia, and pupillary abnormalities (Argyll-Robertson pupils) makes spirochete infection unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Chronic hypertension","explanation":"Chronic hypertension is associated with the development of vascular dementia, which manifests as stepwise deterioration of cognitive function, impaired memory, and asymmetric or focal deficits. However, an MRI of a patient with vascular dementia would reveal multiple white matter infarcts, in contrast to the mammillary atrophy seen here. Moreover, this patient's confabulation and the fact that his long-term memory remains intact are not entirely consistent with vascular dementia.","bool":false},{"option":"Consumption of undercooked meat","explanation":"Consumption of undercooked meat is a risk factor for ingestion of Toxoplasma gondii, which can cause cerebral toxoplasmosis, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Toxoplasmosis typically manifests with a headache, fever, confusion, and focal neurological deficits. Impaired short-term memory and confabulation, as observed in this patient, are not associated with toxoplasmosis.

This patient's history only indicates she is taking metformin, which does not increase the risk of developing hypoglycemia. Factitious hypoglycemia should be considered in this patient, especially given her occupation, which means that she should be asked about the possible use of insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas, meglitinides).\nA diagnosis of factitious hypoglycemia can be made by measuring serum insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and insulin secretagogue concentrations during hypoglycemic episodes.

She can hold a pencil between the first two fingers and the thumb, tells stories, and can hop on one foot. Her maternal uncle has schizophrenia. Her parents are currently divorcing. The child's father has a history of illicit drug use. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The mother is concerned about whether the child is acting out because of the divorce. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?\n\n\n\n","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient's gross motor (hops on one foot), fine motor (tripod pencil grasp), and language (tells stories) developmental milestones are all appropriate for her age.","answers":[{"option":"Reassure the mother","explanation":"\nImaginary friends are relatively common in preschoolers such as this girl and occur as part of normal development. Children typically get along with these friends (e.g., consider them “their best friend”) and the imaginary figures do not cause any distress or impaired functioning. Parents should be reassured. Further evaluation is only indicated if the imaginary friends persist beyond early school age, or if the child's general behavior or development changes.\nStress factors such as the parent's divorce can cause various behavioral responses in different age groups. Preschoolers such as this girl often display magical thinking and may believe that their actions caused the divorce. They can subsequently develop unusual or odd behaviors in the hope of reconciling their parents. Parents should be advised to reassure the child that their actions had no influence on the decision to get a divorce. A counselor can assist if problems persist.","bool":true},{"option":"Inform Child Protective Services","explanation":"Child Protective Services (CPS) should be informed if there are signs of abuse or neglect of a minor. Signs of abuse and neglect can be subtle and history findings of parental drug use should certainly raise concern for the child's well-being. Although patients, particularly following sexual abuse, can develop hallucinations, these hallucinations commonly cause distress rather than comfort as in this patient. Additionally, this patient's age-appropriate milestones, the absence of signs of physical abuse, and the fact that she attends preschool regularly make child maltreatment less likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Begin risperidone therapy","explanation":"\nRisperidone therapy would be indicated in a child with schizophrenia. Although children with schizophrenia typically also have hallucinations that last longer than one month and this child has a family history of schizophrenia, the condition is very rare in children, especially before puberty.

The scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes are the most commonly affected sites, and hair shafts may be of varying lengths. TTM is characterized by a compulsive urge to pull one's hair and consequent feelings of gratification and/or relief from hair pulling. Unlike in obsessive compulsive disorder, individuals with TTM do not experience obsessive or intrusive thoughts. TTM typically manifests in late childhood or early adolescence and is more common in female individuals. Diagnosis may be complicated as individuals with TTM are often reluctant to admit to the behavior. The treatment of choice for TTM is cognitive behavioral therapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Obsessive compulsive disorder","explanation":"In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the individual is driven by obsessive, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) to perform repetitive actions (compulsions), such as hand washing or counting (compulsions).

However, physical examination in alopecia areata typically shows smooth, well-demarcated patches of hair loss. Moreover, short hairs which have a narrowing at the scalp end (i.e., exclamation point hairs) on the periphery of the hairless patch are a characteristic sign of alopecia areata. Irregular patches of hair loss with hair shafts of varying lengths is not an expected finding.","bool":false},{"option":"Scarring alopecia","explanation":"Scarring (cicatricial) alopecia is a rare type of circumscribed alopecia that can result in irregular patches of hair loss. Although the skin in the hair loss patches may also appear normal in scarring alopecia (since destruction and fibrosis of hair follicles occurs below the surface of the skin), more often than not there are signs of inflammation (e.g., redness, scaling, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation). The key differentiating feature is that the condition is not associated with hair of different lengths.","bool":false},{"option":"Androgenetic alopecia","explanation":"\nAndrogenetic alopecia (AA) can occur at puberty in male individuals. In female individuals, however, it occurs at menopause, when estrogen levels decline and testosterone levels increase. AA may also occur in young women if an underlying hyperandrogenic condition exists (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting ovarian tumors). In such cases, signs of virilization (e.g., hirsutism, acne, irregular menses) will be present in addition to the characteristic tiny vellus hairs in the areas of hair loss. AA does not cause hair loss of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The location and pattern of hair loss and the absence of signs of virilization in this patient make the diagnosis of AA unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Telogen effluvium","explanation":"\nTelogen effluvium is an acute onset of diffuse hair loss often triggered by underlying endocrine disease (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism), nutritional deficiency (e.g., hypervitaminosis A, zinc deficiency), certain drugs (e.g., anabolic steroids, antithyroid drugs, antimetabolites), and severe emotional stress. In telogen effluvium, the telogen (i.e., resting) phase of hair growth predominates, resulting in premature shedding of the resting hair and diffuse, nonscarring hair loss.

Nausea is also a common side effect, occurring in 10–20% of patients on lithium.","answers":[{"option":"Provide reassurance and schedule follow-up","explanation":"In many patients, both nausea and the lithium-induced postural tremor decrease over time; most cases are therefore managed conservatively with reassurance, avoidance of exacerbating factors (e.g., caffeine, stress), and follow-up. If the tremor persists, a reduction in the total daily dose of lithium (if serum lithium concentration is close to the upper limit of the therapeutic range), the use of short-acting lithium preparations, and/or divided doses (to reduce peak serum lithium concentrations) can be considered. If the tremor is severe or refractory to expectant management and dosage adjustment, beta blockers (e.g., propranolol), which are also used to treat other forms of postural tremors (e.g., essential tremor, physiologic tremor), can be used. If the tremor is progressive, coarse, irregular, affects parts of the body besides the upper limbs, and/or accompanies other symptoms (e.g., delirium, diarrhea, vomiting), lithium intoxication must be ruled out. Nausea can be reduced by advising the patient to take lithium during or immediately after meals, use of a sustained-release preparation of lithium, and/or divided doses.\nThe differential diagnosis for the lithium-induced postural tremor includes benign essential tremor, Parkinson disease, drug-induced parkinsonism (e.g., due to antipsychotic therapy, often used as an adjunct to a mood stabilizer during the acute manic episode), and metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypoglycemia).","bool":true},{"option":"Begin propranolol therapy","explanation":"\nBeta blockers such as propranolol are only indicated for the management of a lithium-induced postural tremor if the tremor is severe (i.e., causes functional or social impairment for the patient) or is refractory to other steps.

While lithium toxicity usually occurs with serum lithium concentrations &gt; 1.5 mEq/L, this patient's serum lithium concentration is within the reference range. Additionally, lithium intoxication manifests with a coarse, irregular tremor rather than a postural fine tremor, and gastrointestinal manifestations of lithium toxicity are usually more severe and include vomiting and diarrhea rather than mild nausea.","bool":false},{"option":"Replace lithium with valproic acid","explanation":"\nValproic acid, a mood stabilizer, can be used for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder if the side effects of lithium cannot be tolerated by the patient even at the lowest possible dose. However, mild nausea and the lithium-induced postural tremor, as seen here, are not indications for switching from lithium to another mood stabilizer; these particular adverse effects of lithium therapy can be controlled by other means. In bipolar disorder, the mood stabilizer that successfully treated a patient's manic episode (in this case, lithium) should be continued as maintenance therapy unless otherwise indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Decrease the total daily dose of lithium","explanation":"If serum lithium concentration is in the standard (0.60–0.80 mEq/L) or high (0.80–1.00 mEq/L) therapeutic range, decreasing the total daily lithium dose to the minimum effective dose is an appropriate strategy to decrease side effects. In this patient, however, the serum lithium concentration is in the low therapeutic range (0.40–0.60 mEq/L); a further decrease in the total daily lithium dose would impair therapeutic efficacy.

The nutritional deficiency and subsequent energy deficit lead to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis resulting in low FSH, LH, and estrogen, hypothalamic amenorrhea, and possibly anovulatory infertility. Lanugo body hair and parotid gland swelling suggest anorexia nervosa with frequent episodes of vomiting (binge-eating/purging type), putting the patient at increased risk for electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, osteoporosis, and stress fractures.","bool":true},{"option":"Exogenous steroid use","explanation":"\nExogenous steroid use may cause iatrogenic Cushing syndrome that can also manifest with amenorrhea due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and a swollen and rounded face (moon-like facies).

This condition typically occurs in patients with psychiatric illnesses. Although the pathogenesis of this condition is not entirely understood, a central dysfunction of thirst regulation is thought to play an important role. On rare occasions, PP can also occur as a result of hypothalamic lesions that alter the thirst center's osmoregulatory setpoint (e.g., in neurosarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis).

However, other typical features of GHB intoxication such as increased sexual desire, sensitivity to touch and sound, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, perspiration, nausea, and vomiting are not present. Moreover, GHB intoxication would not explain the violent behavior or muscle rigidity seen in this patient.

Since starting puberty about a year ago, the patient has stayed at home most of the time, only rarely meeting friends. The patient's academic performance has been poor for the last year despite having maintained an A average the year before. The mother further reports that her child has had mainly female friends since preschool and never enjoyed playing with “typical boy toys like cars” but instead preferred playing with dolls. The patient appears shy and in a depressed mood. Physical examination shows normal male external genitalia. There is scarce coarse, dark axillary and pubic hair.

Unlike transvestism, transvestic disorder is associated with significant distress and functional impairment. However, as opposed to this adolescent, individuals with transvestic disorder do not identify as or wish to be the opposite gender. When not cross-dressing, they will dress and act in a manner congruent to their assigned gender.

This is characteristic of delusional disorder. Delusions can also occur in patients with psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, mood disorder with psychotic features), and substance use disorders. Other types of delusions include delusions of grandeur, delusions of control, delusions of guilt, erotomaniac delusions, and somatic delusions.","bool":true},{"option":"Hallucinations","explanation":"A hallucination is a perceptual disturbance in which an individual perceives sensory stimuli despite the absence of an actual stimulus. For example, an individual experiencing a visual hallucination could start seeing objects that do not exist. This patient, who believes that the security cameras are being used to follow her, is not imagining the existence of the cameras but rather the purpose for which they are being used. This indicates a disturbance of thought content rather than perception.","bool":false},{"option":"Disorganized thoughts","explanation":"\nDisorganized thoughts (formal thought disorders) are characterized by a lack of logical connection between thoughts or a disturbance in the flow of ideas (e.g., tangentiality, flight of ideas).

An individual with agoraphobia may prefer to remain homebound, as seen here. However, this patient's aversion to going outside is due to the belief that she is being observed rather than the avoidance of specific situations.","bool":false},{"option":"Avolition","explanation":"\nAvolition is characterized by decreased motivation to engage in purposeful activities. An individual with avolition may prefer to remain homebound, as seen here.

In addition, SSRIs may impair male fertility. SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction can remit spontaneously within 2–8 weeks. However, if sexual dysfunction persists, decreasing the SSRI dose or switching to a non-SSRI antidepressant (e.g., bupropion, mirtazapine) may be indicated.","bool":true},{"option":"Postural hypotension","explanation":"\nPostural hypotension is a potential side effect of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), but not a common side effect of SSRIs. TCAs block alpha-1-receptors on the blood vessels, which can cause vasodilation, hypotension, and impaired baroreflexes.","bool":false},{"option":"Urinary retention","explanation":"\nTricyclic antidepressants have anticholinergic effects, which can induce tachycardia, arrhythmia, intestinal ileus, and a decrease in bladder detrusor muscle contraction that can lead to urinary retention. However, anticholinergic effects are not a common side effect of SSRIs like paroxetine.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypertensive crisis","explanation":"\nHypertensive crisis is a potential side effect of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) in combination with the consumption of tyramine-containing products (e.g., aged cheese, smoked meat, wine). Since tyramine is metabolized by MAO, the inhibition of MAO can lead to accumulation of tyramine. Excess tyramine can induce elevated norepinephrine release. This leads to the activation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction and subsequent hypertension. Hypertensive crisis is not an expected adverse effect of treatment with SSRIs.","bool":false},{"option":"Serotonin syndrome","explanation":"\nSerotonin syndrome is a very rare side effect of monotherapy with SSRIs. Instead, this syndrome is more likely to occur with simultaneous use of two or more serotonergic medications (e.g., MAO inhibitor + SSRI). Serotonin syndrome can also occur when switching the medication regimen from one serotonergic drug class to another serotonergic drug class (e.g., from MAO inhibitor to SSRI). For that reason, the first drug should be tapered or even stopped for some days before introducing the new agent.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypothyroidism","explanation":"\nThyroid dysfunction, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, is a potential side effect of lithium. However, thyroid abnormalities are rarely seen in patients taking paroxetine.","bool":false},{"option":"Priapism","explanation":"\nPriapism is a potential side effect of serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) like trazodone. It is assumed that blocking of alpha adrenergic receptors on smooth muscle cells in penile arteries leads to prolonged vasodilation and thus prolonged blood flow into the penis. While priapism can sometimes occur as a side effect of paroxetine, it is not nearly as common as another side effect of SSRIs.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased suicidality","explanation":"While some studies have shown that antidepressants can increase the risk of suicide in patients under 24 years of age with pre-existing suicidal ideation in the first weeks of treatment, there is no evidence that SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants increase suicidality in nonsuicidal individuals of this patient's age group. This rather rare side effect is assumed to be caused by the sequential onset of these drug's effects: While SSRIs can increase a patient's motivation to initiate and perform self-directed activities (including self-harming behavior) already shortly after initiating treatment, the onset of the mood-lifting effects can be delayed by 2–4 weeks. Since this patient is 32 years old and is not suicidal, another side effect should be considered.","bool":false}]},{"id":121,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"A 9-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of poor performance in school for the last year.

When a patient has OUD or is on MMT and is experiencing severe acute pain that does not respond to non-opioid analgesics, the physician can consider regional anesthesia (e.g., neuraxial analgesia, peripheral nerve blocks) or dissociative anesthetics (e.g., ketamine). For situations in which these strategies cannot be used (e.g., contraindication to ketamine due to schizophrenia), the physician should prescribe a short-acting full opioid agonist with p.r.n. doses along with a nonopioid analgesic that is administered regularly at fixed doses.

Sometimes when she thinks of her wife, she suddenly starts crying. The patient says, “I feel bad for not taking proper care of her before she passed. She might have been in pain, and I did not notice it. I wish I could talk to her on the other side to tell her how much I want to be with her again.” She reports having had a nightmare about being diagnosed with cancer a few days after her wife passed. Several times while falling asleep, she has seen her wife sitting in the chair next to her bed, smiling at her. She goes to bed late and always wakes up before her alarm but does not feel tired during the day. She has a good relationship with her son and moved to his home 3 weeks ago because her own apartment reminded her too much of her wife and felt too large for her alone. She attends a chess club 3 days per week and says that she almost forgets about the death of her wife while she is playing chess, which makes her feel guilty later.

Intense sorrow, guilt, yearning, longing to join the deceased, hallucinations of the deceased, as well as insomnia and weight loss, are all considered normal in grieving patients if they do not exceed 12 months or cause significant functional impairment. Normal grief commonly occurs in waves; the intensity and frequency of feelings of emptiness and loss decrease over time. Patients with acute grief usually do not require pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatment, and symptoms commonly resolve within 6–12 months. Management includes reassurance, counseling on sleep hygiene, and education about the expected symptoms of normal grief.\nBecause some symptoms of normal grief are similar to those seen in major depressive disorder, the conditions may be hard to differentiate.

Onset typically occurs in adolescence and is more common in male individuals. Because this patient delays bedtime until 2 AM and wakes up early for school, he experiences daytime sleepiness due to insufficient sleep. On weekends, he does not have to wake for school and gets sufficient sleep, which eliminates daytime drowsiness.

Maintenance pharmacotherapy reduces the risk of disease relapse, self-harm, and suicide. Lithium is the preferred first-line treatment, but the same regimen that successfully treated the acute episode is usually continued as maintenance therapy. Kidney function must be assessed prior to initiating therapy as lithium is renally excreted. Because lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, lithium blood levels must be checked regularly.

However, this patient has acute bradycardia, which should be addressed before initiating psychotherapy to prevent cardiac dysfunction and death.","bool":false},{"option":"Hospitalization and fluoxetine therapy","explanation":"While hospitalization is indicated in this bradycardic patient with anorexia nervosa, fluoxetine therapy is reserved for patients with comorbid depressive or anxiety disorders, which have not resolved with weight restoration. This patient does not report feelings of guilt, anhedonia, or loss of interest, and has not yet received conservative treatment.","bool":false},{"option":"Hospitalization and quetiapine therapy","explanation":"Although hospitalization is indicated in this bradycardic patient with anorexia nervosa, antipsychotic therapy should only be initiated if there is no weight gain despite conservative treatment. Generally, olanzapine is preferred over other antipsychotics such as quetiapine. Olanzapine promotes weight gain and may reduce obsessive thinking. Only low doses should be administered since low weight increases the risk of side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms and sedation.","bool":false},{"option":"Hospitalization and topiramate therapy","explanation":"While hospitalization is indicated in this bradycardic patient with anorexia nervosa, topiramate would be counterproductive, since it promotes further weight loss. It is rather used off-label in patients with binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa who are markedly obese.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Outpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy","explanation":"\nPsychodynamic psychotherapy may be helpful in this patient with anorexia nervosa to analyze her interpersonal relationships and factors that possibly contributed to her condition (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder of her mother).

He denies suicidal ideation. He is more tired than usual and often feels drowsy during the day. The patient has difficulty concentrating at work and has missed two important deadlines; he worries that he might soon lose his job. He is also concerned because he has continuously gained weight despite the initiation of sertraline. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 Ib); BMI is 27 kg/m2.

Switching to a different antidepressant that can facilitate weight loss and that is less likely to cause drowsiness should be considered.","answers":[{"option":"Bupropion","explanation":"The preferred first-line treatment for MDD is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as sertraline. Response to the antidepressant is assessed 6–12 weeks after initiating treatment. If the patient has minimal response to the initial therapy or experiences significant adverse effects, the antidepressant should be replaced with a different one by cross-tapering. The class of antidepressants that should be prescribed as a replacement depends on the type of depressive symptoms (e.g., hypersomnia vs. hyposomnia, hyperphagia vs. anorexia, weight gain vs. weight loss) and the side effects from the initial drug (e.g., SSRIs can cause drowsiness, anorgasmia, and decreased libido). This patient has lethargy, difficulty concentrating, and weight gain, and would therefore benefit from switching to bupropion, an atypical antidepressant that has a stimulant effect and is associated with weight loss. Bupropion also does not cause sexual dysfunction.\nIf the patient has a partial response to the initial antidepressant with minimal adverse effects, then augmentation therapy with another medication (e.g., a different antidepressant, an atypical antipsychotic, lithium, liothyronine) or with psychotherapy should be considered. If the patient has a complete response to the initial antidepressant prescribed for the first onset of a major depressive episode, the drug is continued for another 6–12 months (continuation phase therapy) after which it can be gradually tapered off if the patient remains in remission. Therapy beyond this period (maintenance phase therapy) is considered for patients with a history of recurrent, long-lasting, and/or severe major depressive episodes.","bool":true},{"option":"Aripiprazole","explanation":"\nAripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic and can be used as an augmentation agent if the patient has a partial response to the initial therapy.

For this patient, switching to another antidepressant class with a more favorable side effect profile is appropriate.","bool":false},{"option":"Trazodone","explanation":"\nTrazodone is an atypical antidepressant that causes sedation. An antidepressant without a sedative effect is necessary for this patient with drowsiness, lethargy, and difficulty concentrating. Moreover, if trazodone is used as monotherapy for MDD, high doses of trazodone are needed for an antidepressant effect and are associated with an increased risk of other side effects (e.g., cardiotoxicity, hypertension, priapism). Trazodone is primarily used in low doses for the treatment of insomnia or as an augmentation agent for the treatment of MDD if the patient has insomnia as a predominant symptom.","bool":false},{"option":"Imipramine","explanation":"\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as imipramine, can cause sedation, but also have other significant side effects, including anticholinergic effects (e.g., urinary retention, dry mouth), and are only used in exceptional cases.

Clozapine is associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis. Therefore, the benefits and risks of treatment, as well as the patient's ability to adhere to treatment and follow-ups, must be weighed and discussed with the patient and their family. Before initiating clozapine, the leukocyte count and differential should also be assessed; regular monitoring is indicated during treatment. Patients should have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500 cells/μL before beginning treatment with clozapine. Additionally, monitoring for adverse metabolic effects (e.g., weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia) is also recommended since atypical antipsychotics also increase the risk of metabolic syndrome.","bool":true},{"option":"Administer electroconvulsive therapy","explanation":"\nElectroconvulsive therapy and antipsychotic therapy are indicated for treatment-resistant schizophrenia in patients with low absolute neutrophil counts and for schizophrenia with catatonia, neither of which is the case here.","bool":false},{"option":"Switch to long-term injectable haloperidol","explanation":"Long-term injectable (depot form) antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol) may be considered in patients with schizophrenia with poor treatment adherence.

She likely has the most common subtype of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).","answers":[{"option":"Akathisia","explanation":"\nAkathisia describes the symptoms of motor restlessness seen here. It is an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotic medications, especially high-potency typical antipsychotics (e.g., fluphenazine). The onset of akathisia is typically within 1–8 weeks of treatment initiation, as seen here. If feasible, this patient should have her fluphenazine dosage reduced or she should be switched to an antipsychotic drug with a lower risk of EPS. For persistent akathisia, the first-line pharmacotherapy is a beta blocker (e.g., propranolol). Benzodiazepine or benztropine therapy can be considered for akathisia refractory to beta blocker therapy.\nOther important forms of EPS are pseudoparkinsonism, acute dystonic reactions, and tardive dyskinesia. Pseudoparkinsonism occurs within the same timeframe as akathisia but is characterized by tremors, cogwheel rigidity, and a shuffling gait.

The initial management of akathisia consists of switching to an antipsychotic drug with a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (as was done for this patient) or lowering the dose of the prescribed antipsychotic. When compared to high-potency typical antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine, trifluoperazine), low-potency typical antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine) have a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. However, low-potency typical antipsychotics are associated with a higher risk of anticholinergic effects (e.g., blurred vision, dry mouth) and antihistaminergic effects (e.g., drowsiness), as observed in this patient.

Excessive exercise is commonly seen in this disorder. In addition to low body weight (BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m2), severe caloric restriction leads to a variety of clinical features (e.g., hypothermia, secondary amenorrhea, osteoporosis, dry skin, pancytopenia, electrolyte abnormalities), some of which are seen here. Cardiovascular manifestations include sinus bradycardia, mitral valve prolapse, and hypotension, all of which can lead to syncope. Treatment includes nutritional rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and, in the case of underlying depression or anxiety, SSRIs.","bool":true},{"option":"Occult malignancy","explanation":"An occult malignancy often manifests with anemia and weight loss leading to a low body weight (cancer cachexia), both of which are seen here. Bradycardia, which can lead to lightheadedness and syncope, may be a sign of increased intracranial pressure due to an intracranial tumor (e.g., brain metastases). However, this patient does not have other features that suggest increased intracranial pressure, such as altered mental status, headache, and/or blurry vision. The presence of hypothermia, dry, scaly skin, and an apical systolic murmur suggest a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ","explanation":"\nHypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) can manifest with syncope, particularly during or after intense physical activity, and a systolic murmur. The left ventricular obstruction in HOCM, however, typically results in a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur rather than a mid-to-late systolic murmur, which is heard in this patient. Moreover, the combination of hypothermia, bradycardia, low body weight, and dry, scaly skin suggests a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypothyroidism","explanation":"\nHypothyroidism can manifest with bradycardia, hypothermia, dry, scaly skin, and anemia, all of which are seen here. Furthermore, autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto disease) is associated with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which is likely present here. MVP may, in turn, predispose individuals to arrhythmias and syncope. However, hypothyroidism typically manifests with weight gain despite poor appetite. This patient's low body weight is more consistent with a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Heat exhaustion","explanation":"Strenuous physical activity in a hot, humid environment (e.g., during summer) is a risk factor for heat exhaustion and dehydration, both of which can cause syncope, as seen here. While this patient has features of dehydration (e.g., dry mucous membranes, hypotension), which is an independent risk factor for heat exhaustion, her low core body temperature rules out heat exhaustion. Moreover, patients with heat exhaustion or dehydration are typically tachycardic. The presence of bradycardia in a hypotensive patient alongside low body weight and an apical systolic murmur indicates a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Amphetamine use","explanation":"Performance athletes (e.g., marathon runners) have been known to misuse stimulants such as amphetamines. An acute amphetamine overdose can cause loss of consciousness due to seizures or arrhythmias. Chronic amphetamine use can result in low body weight (due to appetite suppression), irritability, and features of dilated cardiomyopathy, such as an apical, systolic murmur due to functional mitral regurgitation (MR). The murmur associated with MR, however, is typically holosystolic. Moreover, an acute amphetamine overdose usually manifests with tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia rather than bradycardia, hypotension, and hypothermia, which are seen here.

A different long-term management option is more appropriate for this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Dialectical behavioral therapy","explanation":"\nDialectical behavior therapy is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In patients with bipolar disorder, CBT can be used after the remission of an acute manic episode as an adjunct to help the patient avoid stressors that could trigger a relapse of acute mania, as an adjunct to treat depressive episodes that are not controlled by maintenance therapy, and as a tool to increase patient compliance and follow-up. CBT is, however, not effective as stand-alone maintenance therapy in preventing acute manic episodes.\nDialectical behavioral therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Patients with BPD may have some of the features of bipolar disorders such as an unstable mood and impulsivity. However, unlike in patients with bipolar disorder in whom mood swings (mania, hypomania, depression) develop slowly and lasts several days to weeks, the mood swings in BPD are transient (usually a few hours to days) and occur rapidly in reaction to situational or environmental triggers.

The use of lithium is limited by numerous adverse effects. For example, it can induce or worsen preexisting hypothyroidism by blocking the production and release of L-thyroxine. In addition, lithium is a teratogen and it is associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects, such as Ebstein anomaly. Other adverse effects include lithium nephropathy, cardiotoxicity (e.g., T-wave depressions, sinus node dysfunction), and lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism, which can lead to hypercalcemia. Therefore, thyroid and kidney function as well as calcium levels should be assessed, and pregnancy should be ruled out prior to treatment. ECG should be obtained in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis.

In contrast to the hyperreflexia seen in this patient, examination of patients with phencyclidine withdrawal may show delayed reflexes.","bool":false},{"option":"Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid","explanation":"\nGamma-hydroxybutyric acid withdrawal can also cause features of CNS stimulation (e.g., irritability, insomnia), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension), and gastrointestinal complaints (e.g., diarrhea, abdominal pain). However, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid withdrawal does not cause mydriasis and piloerection. Additionally, tremor and increased muscle tone, which are important features of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid withdrawal, are absent in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Methamphetamine","explanation":"The withdrawal features of methamphetamine, a CNS stimulant, resemble the features of a severe depressive disorder, with hypersomnolence, anhedonia, lack of energy/motivation, and depressed mood. Constricted pupils would also be expected. The vital parameters are usually normal in methamphetamine withdrawal. Since this patient presents with a completely different profile of clinical features, methamphetamine withdrawal can be ruled out as the cause.","bool":false},{"option":"Cannabis","explanation":"Withdrawal from cannabis can also cause sweats, chills, insomnia, hypertension, and tachycardia. More commonly, cannabis withdrawal causes a mood disorder (e.g., depression, irritability, aggression), which is not seen in this patient.

In addition to features of sympathetic overactivity, acute cocaine overdose can also cause hallucinations (including tactile hallucinations such as formication) and paranoid ideation. Acute cocaine overdose is treated with benzodiazepines and alpha-1 blockers (e.g., phenoxybenzamine). In the case of a suspected cocaine overdose, beta-blockers should not be used as first-line therapy because they can lead to unopposed alpha-1 receptor activation and thereby precipitate a hypertensive crisis or myocardial ischemia due to coronary vasospasm. Chronic use of cocaine can cause nasal septal hypertrophy (if used intranasally), periportal hepatitis (if ingested), myocarditis, and/or pulmonary artery hypertension.\n\n","bool":true},{"option":"Lysergic acid diethylamide","explanation":"An overdose of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) can cause hallucinations, anxiety, and, rarely, features of sympathetic overactivity due to the effects of the drug itself or serotonin syndrome.

These mechanisms increase the synaptic release of norepinephrine and serotonin. Although mirtazapine is typically considered a second-line antidepressant for major depressive disorder, it stimulates appetite and can cause weight gain, which is desirable in a patient with comorbid anorexia nervosa.\nMirtazapine also causes sedation (which may be useful in patients with comorbid insomnia disorder) and dry mouth.","bool":true},{"option":"B","explanation":"Activation of α2-adrenergic receptors is the mechanism of action of clonidine, α-methyldopa, and brimonidine. Clonidine is used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and hypertensive urgency, while α-Methyldopa is used to treat hypertension during pregnancy. Brimonidine is used to treat open-angle glaucoma. None of these drugs is indicated in major depressive disorder or anorexia nervosa.","bool":false},{"option":"C","explanation":"Activation of monoamine oxidase (along with inhibition of sodium channels and GABA transaminase) is the mechanism of action of valproic acid. This drug is used to treat seizures, migraines, and bipolar disorder but is not indicated in major depressive disorder or anorexia nervosa.","bool":false},{"option":"D","explanation":"Inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) is the mechanism of action of MAO inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine). This group of drugs reduces the breakdown of intrasynaptic amine neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine). MAO inhibitors are rarely used as first-line or second-line antidepressants because of their potentially severe side effects, which include hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. They are most commonly used to treat atypical depression and anxiety and would not be the most appropriate choice for a patient with major depressive disorder and anorexia nervosa.","bool":false},{"option":"E","explanation":"Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake is part of the mechanism of action of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and bupropion. SNRIs and TCAs (which also inhibit serotonin reuptake) can be used to treat major depressive disorder but are not the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for a patient with comorbid anorexia nervosa. Bupropion (which also inhibits dopamine reuptake) reduces the seizure threshold and is therefore contraindicated in individuals with increased seizure risk, which include patients with anorexia nervosa.","bool":false},{"option":"F","explanation":"Activation of norepinephrine reuptake is a mechanism that is of interest for the treatment of depression.

In addition, LSD has mild sympathomimetic effects (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis). Treatment consists of supportive care and reassurance. If needed, antipsychotics may be given for psychosis and benzodiazepines for anxiety.\nSymptoms of hallucinogen intoxication typically resolve spontaneously after 6–12 hours. Long-term complications include persistent psychosis and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder.","bool":true},{"option":"Cannabis","explanation":"\nCannabis use can cause acute symptoms such as distorted time perception and visual hallucinations; it can also manifest with mild tachycardia, mydriasis, and changes in blood pressure.

Antidepressant therapy is divided into three phases: acute phase, continuation phase, and maintenance phase. The acute phase refers to the initial therapy following diagnosis. In the continuation phase of treatment, patients remain on their therapeutic regimen for 16–36 weeks (4–9 months) after achieving remission. Patients who have a sustained response to continuation pharmacotherapy for at least 6 months are recommended to transition to maintenance therapy if at least one of the following indications is present: three or more major depressive episodes, severe episodes (e.g., suicidal ideation), and/or risk factors for recurrence (e.g., onset ≤ 18–21 years). The total duration of maintenance phase treatment is patient-dependent and must be reevaluated regularly; it can be lifelong. Ideally, pharmacotherapy is combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy.\nSide effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors include sexual dysfunction, serotonin syndrome, and an increased risk of suicidal ideation, particularly in adolescents and young adults; careful monitoring is essential.","bool":true},{"option":"Continue paroxetine therapy for 6 months","explanation":"Continuation of paroxetine for 6 months is the correct approach in patients who are in remission and have had only one depressive episode. This patient is currently in remission, but he has had several depressive episodes and therefore requires a different management approach.","bool":false},{"option":"Discontinue paroxetine","explanation":"\nAntidepressants such as paroxetine should never be discontinued abruptly in patients with major depressive disorder, but rather tapered off over weeks or months to avoid antidepressant discontinuation syndrome or a relapse of depression. Moreover, this patient responded well to paroxetine therapy and has not reported side effects. Discontinuation is not recommended at this point.","bool":false},{"option":"Switch from paroxetine to lithium therapy","explanation":"Patients with depressive symptoms should be thoroughly screened for bipolar disorder before beginning treatment, and they should be monitored for new-onset insomnia and irritability after initiating selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy. Paroxetine can precipitate a shift to hypomania or mania in patients with bipolar disorder. This patient has become more active and his mood is elevated, but he does not have a history of hypomania or mania or symptoms specific to it (i.e., decreased need for sleep, flight of ideas, distractibility, and/or excessive involvement in risky activities). Therefore, a switch to lithium is unnecessary.","bool":false},{"option":"Taper paroxetine over 2 months","explanation":"\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should always be tapered off at some point. However, only two additional months is too short of a time frame for this patient with recurrent depressive episodes, and premature cessation could lead to a recurrence of depressive symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Switch from paroxetine to cognitive behavioral therapy","explanation":"Switching to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could be considered if the patient does not respond sufficiently to paroxetine after 4–6 weeks of treatment or has unacceptable adverse effects. This patient responded well to paroxetine therapy and has not reported side effects such as sexual dysfunction. While CBT should be considered as an adjunct therapy, switching to CBT alone would not be appropriate.","bool":false},{"option":"Switch from paroxetine to valproic acid therapy","explanation":"Patients with depressive symptoms should be thoroughly screened for bipolar disorder before beginning treatment and monitored for new-onset insomnia and irritability after initiating selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy. Paroxetine can precipitate a shift to hypomania or mania in patients with bipolar disorder. While this patient has become more active and his mood is elevated, he does not have a history of hypomania or mania and lacks characteristic symptoms (i.e., decreased need for sleep, flight of ideas, distractibility, and/or excessive involvement in risky activities). Therefore, a switch to valproic acid is unnecessary.","bool":false},{"option":"Switch from paroxetine to venlafaxine therapy","explanation":"Switching to a different antidepressant, such as venlafaxine, would be indicated if the patient did not respond sufficiently to paroxetine after 4–6 weeks of treatment or in the case of unacceptable adverse effects. This patient responded well to paroxetine therapy and has not reported side effects. Changing to another selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a different class of antidepressants is therefore unnecessary.","bool":false},{"option":"Add lithium to current regimen","explanation":"\nLithium can be combined with paroxetine in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

A BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m2 indicates that this adolescent girl has anorexia nervosa.","answers":[{"option":"Fractures","explanation":"\nSevere bone loss and subsequent fractures are common complications of anorexia nervosa. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are caused by a combination of nutritional deficiencies (e.g., Vitamin D deficiency) and hormone abnormalities (e.g., low estrogen and testosterone), which lead to decreased bone mineral density and thus significantly increase the risk of fractures. Furthermore, frequent and strenuous exercise, which is very common in patients with anorexia nervosa, make affected patients prone to stress fractures.\nThe female athlete triad is defined as the combination of menstrual dysfunction, calorie deficit, and decreased bone density in athletic female young adults or adolescents.","bool":true},{"option":"Recurrent infections","explanation":"\nCytopenias, including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, are commonly observed in patients with severe anorexia nervosa. They are usually reversible with nutritional rehabilitation. Despite leukopenia and a malnourished overall state, patients with anorexia nervosa are not more prone to recurrent infections than healthy individuals. Another complication is far more common.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperkalemia","explanation":"\nAnorexia nervosa is associated with various electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia, but not hyperkalemia.

There is no evidence that anorexia nervosa is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Instead, studies indicate that individuals with prolonged lifetime estrogen exposure (nulliparity, early menarche, late menopause) and/or high estrogen levels (e.g., postmenopausal estrogen supplementation) are at greater risk for developing ovarian cancer.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Aortic valve regurgitation","explanation":"\nAnorexia nervosa is associated with certain structural cardiac abnormalities including decreased overall cardiac mass, mitral valve prolapse, and pericardial effusion. Mitral valve prolapse may result in mitral valve regurgitation. However, aortic valve regurgitation is not a common complication.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperthyroidism","explanation":"Patients with anorexia nervosa may present with abnormal thyroid function tests due to chronic malnutrition. Lab values may show normal or low T4, TSH, and low T3, a pattern referred to as sick euthyroid syndrome. These changes are a physiologic adaptation in response to chronic undernutrition, slowing down the overall metabolism in order to conserve limited resources. L-thyroxin is not indicated unless overt hypothyroidism is present, since it may worsen complications of anorexia nervosa such as bone loss and arrhythmias due to its adverse effects. Hyperthyroidism is not a complication of anorexia nervosa.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Shortened QT interval","explanation":"\nAnorexia nervosa is associated with several functional cardiac abnormalities, including hypotension, bradycardia, and QT dispersion or a prolonged (rather than shortened) QT interval.

CD typically presents during childhood or adolescence but may persist beyond 18 years of age and result in antisocial personality disorder. It may be preceded by oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Risk factors for developing CD include genetic, psychological, and social factors (e.g., family instability). CD is also associated with adolescent drug use (e.g., marijuana). Treatment involves cognitive behavioral therapy, parent management training, social skills training, and pharmacotherapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Antisocial personality disorder","explanation":"\nAntisocial personality disorder is characterized by unlawful behavior, aggression, and impulsivity, which are all seen in this patient.

While this patient may develop antisocial personality disorder at a later time, it is not the correct diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Oppositional defiant disorder","explanation":"\nOppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is characterized by anger, irritable mood, and defiant behavior toward figures of authority lasting at least 6 months which may also cause problems at school. During early childhood, the disorder more commonly affects boys, whereas after puberty there is an equal incidence in boys and girls. While aggression and resistance in children with ODD are caused by the feeling of being controlled, this patient shows behavior that violates the rights of others (e.g., bullying, theft, and destruction of property), which is a diagnostic criterion for a different disorder.","bool":false},{"option":"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder","explanation":"\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should be suspected in children/adolescents that present with poor performance at school and difficulties with concentration and attention, like this patient. However, to make the diagnosis, the symptoms must be present before the 12th birthday and include at least 5 features of hyperactivity and/or at least 5 features of inattention.

However, if this does not suffice or is not feasible due to active psychotic illness, pharmaceutical treatment should be initiated to provide symptomatic relief. Centrally-acting muscarinic antagonists, e.g., benztropine and trihexyphenidyl, are the preferred treatment for pseudoparkinsonism associated with antipsychotic drugs in most patients. Elderly patients, however, should be treated with amantadine to avoid the potential anticholinergic side effects of muscarinic antagonists (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, cognitive impairments, delirium).","bool":true},{"option":"β-adrenergic antagonist","explanation":"\nβ-adrenergic antagonists such as propranolol are the preferred treatment for essential tremor.

His history of depression suggests bipolar I disorder, for which lithium is the preferred therapy.","answers":[{"option":"Urine culture","explanation":"Routine urine cultures are unnecessary with lithium treatment because this drug is not associated with urinary tract infections. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a possible side effect of lithium as a result of interference with ADH signaling. However, a urine culture is irrelevant in diagnosing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.","bool":false},{"option":"Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone","explanation":"\nLithium, a mood stabilizer commonly used as monotherapy for both acute and long-term treatment of mild to moderate manic episodes of bipolar disorder, blocks the coupling of thyroid hormone precursors, the release of T4 and T3, and the conversion of T4 to T3. As a result, hypothyroidism is a common side effect of lithium, which is why thyroid function tests (e.g., thyroid-stimulating hormone and free T4) should be performed every 6–12 months during ongoing treatment. Lithium-induced hypothyroidism, which is often subclinical, should be treated with replacement therapy. There is usually no need to discontinue lithium therapy.\nFurther side effects of lithium include tremor, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, teratogenicity (in particular Ebstein anomaly), and ECG changes (e.g., T-wave depressions).","bool":true},{"option":"Serum glucose","explanation":"Although lithium has been associated with hyperglycemia, this is an uncommon side effect; therefore, regular measurement of serum glucose is not recommended during ongoing treatment. Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine), which can be used to treat acute mania or as adjunctive therapy for refractory bipolar disorder, are known to cause hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Thus, fasting serum glucose should be monitored regularly in patients using this group of drugs.","bool":false},{"option":"Complete blood count with differential","explanation":"Although leukocytosis is a possible side effect of lithium, this is usually clinically insignificant and does not warrant the regular measurement of complete blood count with differential. Clozapine, which is sometimes used for treatment-resistant bipolar disorder, can cause life-threatening agranulocytosis, which is why a complete blood count should frequently be obtained in patients using this drug.","bool":false},{"option":"Serum aminotransferases","explanation":"Regular measurement of serum aminotransferases is not necessary with lithium treatment because this drug is not known to cause liver damage. Valproic acid, which can also be used as a mood stabilizer in patients with bipolar disorder, is associated with severe hepatotoxicity.

Which of the following best describes this patient's perception?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient's misinterpretation of a real external stimuli is a common symptom of delirium.","answers":[{"option":"Illusion","explanation":"An illusion is a perceptual abnormality, in which an actual external stimulus is misinterpreted. This patient had a visual illusion because he saw the bathrobe and perceived it to be a burglar. This patient's disturbance of sensory perception is likely due to postoperative delirium, to which older patients are particularly susceptible.","bool":true},{"option":"Delusion","explanation":"A delusion is a fixed, false belief that does not stem from customs, culture, or religion, and is maintained despite proof to the contrary (e.g., a patient insisting that they can fly, a patient insisting that they have won the lottery when this is not the case). This patient has a disturbance of sensory perception (not a delusion) when he perceives the bathrobe to be a burglar.","bool":false},{"option":"Loose association","explanation":"\nLoose association refers to the presentation of multiple ideas without a logical connection or flow between them. This patient has clearly stated his sensory perception (i.e., the bathrobe perceived as a burglar) and has not changed the topic.","bool":false},{"option":"Hallucination","explanation":"This patient most likely suffers from postoperative delirium, which can cause visual hallucinations. Hallucinations are, however, disturbances of sensory perceptions that occur in the absence of external stimuli. In this patient, the disturbance of sensory perception occurs in the presence of an external visual stimulus (i.e., the bathrobe).","bool":false},{"option":"External attribution","explanation":"Individuals displaying external attribution attempt to establish a cause for their feelings. This delirious patient is not attempting to establish a cause for his observation or his agitation but merely stating what he has perceived.","bool":false},{"option":"Labile affect","explanation":"A labile affect is characterized by excessive displays of emotion, emotions that are not congruent with a situation or the individual's mood, or a rapid change in the individual's emotions. This patient's affect is congruent with his perceived situation (agitation after suspecting the presence of a burglar) and does not change rapidly.","bool":false}]},{"id":203,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents because of difficulty at school.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"Early intervention programs can improve communication and social skills for patients with this disorder.","answers":[{"option":"Autism spectrum disorder","explanation":"Although clinical presentation varies widely, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairment in social interaction and restrictive patterns of behavior or interests. This patient's trouble communicating, together with her inattentiveness, refusal to speak and make eye contact, and her attraction to a repetitive activity (drawing circles), is typical of patients with ASD. While the exact cause is unknown, twin studies strongly suggest a genetic predisposition.","bool":true},{"option":"Childhood disintegrative disorder","explanation":"Patients with childhood disintegrative disorder initially meet their developmental milestones before losing them again over the course of a few months. This patient's history does not describe developmental regression.","bool":false},{"option":"Oppositional defiant disorder","explanation":"\nOppositional defiant disorder is characterized by anger, irritable mood, and defiant behavior towards figures of authority, which may also cause problems at school for ≥ 6 months.

Synthetic cathinones increase the release, and decrease the reuptake, of monoamines (norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin), leading to sympathetic stimulation and neuropsychiatric changes (e.g., hallucinations, delusions accompanied by aggression toward others), as seen here. In rare cases, patients also have myoclonus and/or seizures. In contrast to amphetamines, bath salts have a longer duration of effect, and symptoms can last for days or even weeks. Since many synthetic cathinones cannot be detected by routine urine toxicology screening, the diagnosis is typically based on history and observed clinical features. Treatment of acute intoxication is supportive (e.g., maintaining a patent airway, fluid therapy, benzodiazepines if patients are agitated).","bool":true},{"option":"Amitriptyline","explanation":"Intoxication with amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic effects, can manifest with hyperthermia, tachycardia, mydriasis, and agitation, all of which are seen here.

However, cocaine has a short duration of action (several minutes to 2 hours depending on the route of administration) whereas this patient is still symptomatic 8 hours after she was found by her neighbor, making cocaine intoxication unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Ecstasy","explanation":"\nEcstasy (MDMA) intoxication can manifest with tachycardia, mydriasis, hyperthermia, hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, and hallucinations, all of which are seen here. However, common effects include increased thirst, euphoria, and feelings of intimacy, which this patient does not have. In addition, effects typically last 4–6 hours whereas this patient is still symptomatic 8 hours after she was found by her neighbor. Furthermore, aggressive behavior is uncommon in MDMA intoxication.","bool":false},{"option":"Lysergic acid diethylamide","explanation":"\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a synthetic hallucinogenic drug that can cause altered mental status. Although LSD intoxication can manifest with symptoms of sympathetic activation (e.g., hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, mydriasis), these findings are usually milder than those seen in this patient.

He has left the front door wide open and tap water running on multiple occasions. The patient is concerned about his memory lapses. He wakes up 6–7 times during the night. He often feels too tired to leave his room and rarely makes conversation with his daughter. He says that he used to enjoy playing the piano but has not played for several months. He has hypertension treated with amlodipine. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination shows orientation to person, place, and time as well as psychomotor retardation. He has a blunted affect. Attention, concentration, and short- and long-term memory are impaired. Neurological examination shows no focal findings.

In patients with late-life depression, cognitive deficits may resemble dementia (i.e., pseudodementia). Compared to patients with other types of dementia, patients with pseudodementia are more likely to be aware of and concerned about memory impairment. Cognitive deficits in MDD typically have a sudden onset and manifest after the mood symptoms (e.g., this patient lost interest in playing the piano several months ago). Treatment of the underlying depression, e.g., with SSRIs such as citalopram, may lead to remission of the depression and reversal of the cognitive deficits. In older patients in particular, different causes of dementia must be considered if memory impairment persists after appropriate treatment and an improvement in depressive symptoms.\nSee “Differential diagnosis of subtypes of dementia” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Ventriculoperitoneal shunt","explanation":"A cerebral shunt is the treatment of choice for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). While NPH typically manifests with impaired memory, other typical findings such as incontinence and ataxic gait are absent in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Donepezil","explanation":"\nDonepezil is indicated in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer dementia (AD). Patients with AD can present with impairment of daily life and, especially in early stages, show symptoms of depression. However, the onset of AD is usually insidious, with progression over ∼ 8–10 years. The memory of recent events is typically the cognitive domain affected first in patients with AD. For this reason, patients are typically not oriented to person, place, or time. Also, unlike this patient who is concerned about his memory loss, patients with AD are often not aware of their cognitive deficits.","bool":false},{"option":"Memantine","explanation":"\nMemantine can be used in addition to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer dementia or vascular dementia. This patient's memory deficits could be explained by either of these dementia types, and depressive symptoms may occur in early dementia. However, his cognitive deficits are more likely to be caused by pseudodementia.","bool":false},{"option":"Aspirin","explanation":"\nAntiplatelet drugs such as aspirin may be considered in patients with vascular dementia. This type of dementia may present with abrupt cognitive decline and stepwise deterioration. This patient has risk factors for vascular dementia such as hypertension and advanced age.

Their anxiety is driven by feelings of embarrassment and the fear that others may notice their reaction. Patients may also avoid situations where there are a large number of people (e.g., crowded parks). Treatment for social anxiety disorder involves cognitive behavioral therapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Avoidant personality disorder","explanation":"Patients with an avoidant personality disorder also experience fear and anxiety during social interactions, to the extent that they avoid social settings too. However, their fear is driven by feelings of rejection, inadequacy, and being disliked, rather than feelings of embarrassment and others noticing their anxiety, as in this patient. Additionally, these symptoms usually already begin during adolescence rather than at 23 years of age. Lastly, the anxiety associated with avoidant personality disorder does not typically trigger somatic symptoms like palpitations, sweating, and nausea; such a severe reaction is characteristic of a different disorder.","bool":false},{"option":"Schizotypal personality disorder","explanation":"Patients with a schizotypal personality disorder would be averse to social interactions and may even develop symptoms of anxiety in such a setting. However, such patients would also exhibit eccentric behavior, dress oddly, and/or have strange beliefs that are inconsistent with cultural norms.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Atypical depression","explanation":"Although atypical depression may result in weight gain, it is usually the result of hyperphagia. However, this patient's appetite has not changed. Other features such as hypersomnia and/or a blunt affect would also be present in atypical depression.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Pheochromocytoma","explanation":"\nPheochromocytoma can result in recurrent episodes of palpitations and sweating.

Weight loss would be seen instead of weight gain.\n\n","bool":false},{"option":"Generalized anxiety disorder","explanation":"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) would result in symptoms of anxiety such as palpitations, sweating, and nausea. Anxiety in GAD is not caused by a single specific fear but by various aspects of daily life. This patient's distress stems from a specific situation.","bool":false},{"option":"Normal shyness","explanation":"Shy patients may avoid eye contact and find it difficult to speak in front of others but shyness is a normal personality variant that does not impact the quality of life. Somatic symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, and nausea would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Autism spectrum disorder","explanation":"Patients with an autism spectrum disorder would have difficulty with social interactions (e.g., an inability to hold a conversation, decreased eye contact). However, autism spectrum disorder is more common among males, and the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder usually begin before the age of 2 years with a rapid deterioration of language and social skills.

These features in a patient who is taking serotonergic drugs (citalopram and venlafaxine) are diagnostic of serotonin syndrome, which is caused by increased serotonergic neurotransmission. It can be triggered by taking two serotonergic agents simultaneously or rapidly switching from one serotonergic agent to another without tapering the dose, as was the case with this patient. Serotonin syndrome is a clinical diagnosis and there are currently no laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Dopamine receptor blockade","explanation":"Individuals taking neuroleptics (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) are at risk of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) due to dopamine receptor blockade (especially D2). NMS can present with features of autonomic instability (diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension), hyperthermia, tremors, and disorientation, as seen in this patient. However, NMS develops slowly (days to weeks) and is characterized by neuromuscular sluggishness (bradyreflexia, muscular rigidity). Moreover, this patient is not taking neuroleptics.","bool":false},{"option":"Suspected amphetamine intake","explanation":"\nAmphetamine is a CNS stimulant, which acts by increasing the release of neurotransmitters (adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin) from presynaptic vesicles. Amphetamine toxicity presents with the same symptoms as this patient (hyperthermia, sweating, tachycardia, hypertension, tremors, ataxia and hyperreflexia) due to sympathetic hyperactivity. However, it is more reasonable to consider the effects of serotonergic drugs as the cause of this patient's complaints than to assume that she is using amphetamines.","bool":false},{"option":"Anticholinergic toxicity","explanation":"Overdose of anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine, benztropine, trihexyphenidyl) can cause anticholinergic poisoning which also presents with tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, confusion, tremor, and hyperreflexia. However, patients with anticholinergic toxicity characteristically have dry skin, while this patient presents with increased sweating. In addition, there is no history of anticholinergic drug use in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Abnormal ryanodine receptor","explanation":"An abnormal/mutated ryanodine receptor increases the risk of developing malignant hyperthermia, which also presents with hyperthermia, hypertension, and tachycardia. However, tremors and hyperreflexia are not seen in malignant hyperthermia. Volatile anesthetic agents (e.g., sevoflurane, enflurane, halothane) and/or succinylcholine can trigger malignant hyperthermia in susceptible individuals.

Because her C-peptide level is low, she likely has factitious hypoglycemia resulting from surreptitious exogenous insulin use. This behavior is often caused by factitious disorder, a psychiatric condition in which an individual feigns signs of a medical condition in order to assume the role of a sick patient. The diagnostic criteria for factitious disorder are the intentional falsification of an illness, presenting oneself as ill, and deception in spite of any evident reward, in the absence of another condition that would better explain these behaviors. This patient has access to insulin as a nurse aide and is injecting insulin to assume the sick role.","bool":true},{"option":"Reactive postprandial hypoglycemia","explanation":"\nReactive postprandial hypoglycemia can manifest as symptomatic hypoglycemia with high levels of insulin, as seen in this patient.

This causes individuals to feel the need to go to bed early and to wake up early in the morning regardless of when they go to bed. A patient who delays going to bed will therefore not get an adequate quantity of sleep, resulting in daytime sleepiness. Advanced sleep phase disorder is frequently associated with older age.","bool":true},{"option":"Delayed sleep phase disorder","explanation":"Patients with delayed sleep phase disorder would have excessive daytime sleepiness if they forced themselves to wake up before the end of their sleep-wake cycle. This patient, however, wakes up spontaneously early in the morning. Moreover, delayed sleep phase disorder causes individuals to go to bed later than normal (usually 1–4 AM) and would not result in excessive sleepiness in the evening. Factors associated with this condition include puberty, irregular sleep schedules, and caffeine/nicotine consumption before bedtime, none of which are seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Depressive disorder","explanation":"Depression can manifest initially as a sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia) and is often associated with early awakening. However, since this patient does not have other features of depression such as anhedonia, a depressed mood, and/or a change in appetite, another disorder is more likely.

Individuals with schizoid personality disorder neither desire nor enjoy close relationships. They show little interest in interpersonal or sexual contact and often appear indifferent or emotionally cold towards others (see “Overview of cluster A personality disorders” table). Of note, the DSM-5 states that personality disorders can be diagnosed in patients &lt; 18 years of age if features have been present for ≥ 1 year. The only exception to this rule is antisocial personality disorder, which can only be diagnosed in patients ≥ 18 years of age.\nPersonality disorders are characterized by pervasive, inflexible, and maladaptive patterns of relating to and perceiving one's self and one's environment that cause significant distress and/or functional impairment.

This patient's presentation (i.e., headache, depressed mood, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, sensory disturbances, irritability, ataxia, tremor, and myalgia) is consistent with antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), a known side effect of sudden discontinuation of SSRIs. Paroxetine, in particular, is associated with an increased risk of ADS. The main clinical features of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome can be remembered with the mnemonic FINISH: Flu-like symptoms, Insomnia, Nausea, Instability, Sensory disturbances, and Hyperarousal. Treatment consists of restarting antidepressant therapy at the original dose before beginning to taper slowly for at least 2–4 weeks.\nAlthough exposure to SSRIs during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a low risk of teratogenicity, some studies have suggested an increased risk of congenital heart defects related to the use of paroxetine.

Emesis leads to a loss of hydrogen ions secreted by gastric parietal cells, as well as a loss of chloride ions. Moreover, the alkalotic environment results in increased activity of cellular K+/H+ antiporter, which moves H+ ions extracellularly to correct the alkalosis. In exchange, K+ ions are being moved intracellularly, creating a state of relative hypokalemia.","bool":true},{"option":"E","explanation":"These lab findings are consistent with a primary, acute respiratory alkalosis secondary to hyperventilation, which we can assume given the elevated pH but normal bicarbonate. Hyperventilation increases CO2 exhalation, leading to a decreased load of hydrogen ions within the blood and alkalosis.

Although SSRIs can help maintain erections by delaying orgasm (its MOA as treatment of premature ejaculation), it is actually associated with a decreased libido and difficulty acquiring an erection. Thus, this patient's erectile dysfunction would likely worsen with initiation of an SSRI, and therefore, it is not the preferred medication for him.","bool":false},{"option":"Clonazepam","explanation":"\nClonazepam, a benzodiazepine, can be used as an adjunctive medication in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. While effective in improving symptoms in the short-term, benzodiazepines should never be used in long-term management because of their high potential for addiction and negative side-effect profile. In this patient, the history of risky alcohol use puts him at increased risk of developing dependence and abuse, so this class of medications should be avoided.","bool":false}]},{"id":220,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior.

Moreover, excessive social anxiety, odd speech, inappropriate affect, and lack of close friends are usually also seen.\nSee “Overview of cluster A personality disorders” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Schizoid personality disorder","explanation":"Patients with schizoid personality disorder present with eccentric behavior and difficulty developing meaningful social relationships. However, a key component of schizoid personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of social withdrawal and limited range of emotional expression. Patients are content with social isolation and do not seek relationships. Although this patient does not have friends and spends most of his time alone, patients with schizoid personality disorder would be more indifferent about social interactions than anxious. Furthermore, this patient's interest in paranormal phenomena, magical thinking, and eccentric clothing would not be explained by this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Autism spectrum disorder","explanation":"\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is usually diagnosed in young children who present with persistent impairment in communication and social interaction as well as restricted, stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Although this young man is uncomfortable around other people, his age and the absence of additional symptoms of ASD, including impaired language skills or repetitive movements and behavior, makes the diagnosis unlikely. The diagnosis of ASD would also not explain this patient's preoccupation with paranormal phenomena.","bool":false},{"option":"Schizophrenia","explanation":"Patients with schizophrenia present with chronic and recurrent psychosis for more than 6 months.

Although this patient prefers to be alone and has odd beliefs, he does not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, as he has no clear delusions or hallucinations and no disorganized speech.\nThis patient's laborious speech is not the same as disorganized speech. Laborious speech is nonfluent speech that requires excessive effort and lacks spontaneity, but the thought processes and the contents of the speech are intact. On the other hand, disorganized speech results from disorganized thought processes and can manifest as loose associations (illogical, sudden, and frequent changes of topic), word salad (sequence of words without a logical connection), and flight of ideas (quick succession of thoughts), none of which are evident in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Avoidant personality disorder","explanation":"Patients with avoidant personality disorder are uncomfortable around other people and avoid social settings. Their discomfort is driven by a feeling of inadequacy and/or an intense fear of rejection or embarrassment, and they tend to desire interpersonal relationships even if they are anxious about interacting with others. However, this patient's social withdrawal appears voluntary and his odd beliefs and unusual clothing choices would not be explained by this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Paranoid personality disorder","explanation":"Patients with paranoid personality disorder are generally emotionally isolated and have eccentric behavior. However, a key component of paranoid personality disorder is suspicion of and distrust toward others due to the belief that others have malicious intentions.

Patients are therefore advised to follow a low-tyramine diet during therapy with MAO inhibitors.","bool":false},{"option":"Serotonin syndrome","explanation":"\nSerotonin syndrome is a very rare side effect of monotherapy with SSRIs, as is the case in this patient. Instead, this syndrome is more likely to occur with simultaneous use of two or more serotonergic medications (e.g., MAO inhibitor and SSRI). Serotonin syndrome can also occur when switching the medication regimen from one serotonergic drug class to another serotonergic drug class (e.g., from MAO inhibitor to SSRI). For that reason, the first drug should be tapered or even stopped for some days before introducing the new agent.","bool":false},{"option":"Priapism","explanation":"\nPriapism is a potential side effect of serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) like trazodone. It is assumed that blocking of alpha adrenergic receptors on smooth muscle cells in penile arteries leads to prolonged vasodilation and thus prolonged blood flow into the penis. While priapism can sometimes occur as a side effect of sertraline, it is not nearly as common as another side effect of SSRIs.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased suicidality","explanation":"While some studies have shown that antidepressants can increase the risk of suicide in patients under 24 years of age with pre-existing (!) suicidal ideation in the first weeks of treatment, there is no evidence that SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants increase suicidality in nonsuicidal individuals of this patient's age group. This rather rare side effect is assumed to be caused by the sequential onset of these drug's effects: while SSRIs can increase a patient's motivation to initiate and perform self-directed activities (including self-harming behavior) already shortly after initiating treatment, the onset of the mood-lifting effects can be delayed by 2–4 weeks. Since this patient is 58 years old and is not suicidal, another side effect should be considered.","bool":false}]},{"id":229,"info":"Behavioral Sciences","question":"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his sister because she has noticed that he has been behaving differently over the past 4 weeks.

In addition to these two criteria, a diagnosis of DID requires that the symptoms cause significant social or occupational impairment and that the symptoms must not be related to substance use, other medical conditions, or be part of an accepted cultural or religious practice. This patient's sudden behavioral changes (child-like behavior, angry outbursts, calm and confident behavior at time of visit) are suggestive of separate identity states. Moreover, his recurrent episodes of amnesia, recent loss of employment, and behavioral changes that are not limited to his weekend alcohol use further support the diagnosis of DID. Further manifestations of DID present in this patient include episodes of derealization (“feelings of not being part of this world”) and auditory hallucinations (suggested by the patient “talking to the others”). A history of abuse or neglect during childhood is present in about 90% of patients with DID.\nAlthough patients with DID are commonly portrayed in movies as abusive or harmful towards others, they are rather more susceptible to self-harm and suicide.","bool":true},{"option":"Dissociative amnesia","explanation":"\nDissociative amnesia is characterized by memory gaps that lead to clinically significant social and/or occupational impairment.

Affected individuals often describe this feeling as observing themselves from outside their bodies. This patient, however, describes a feeling of “not being part of this world”, which is more consistent with derealization than depersonalization. In derealization, individuals feel detached from the external environment. Finally, neither depersonalization nor derealization disorder is associated with memory gaps or sudden changes in behavior.","bool":false},{"option":"Schizophrenia","explanation":"\nSchizophrenia is characterized by recurring (or chronic) episodes of psychosis, which may be characterized by behavioral changes. This patient's conversations with invisible people could suggest auditory hallucinations, a schizophrenia-defining symptom.

Tetrabenazine is a dopamine depleter that effectively reduces the severity of tics, and it is generally well tolerated. The only FDA-approved medications for the treatment of tics are haloperidol, pimozide, and aripiprazole, all of which are dopamine receptor antagonists. Other dopamine receptor antagonists (e.g., fluphenazine and risperidone) have shown a similar response rate in reducing the frequency and intensity of tics. However, these agents are no longer preferred because of the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Instead, dopamine depleters are used to treat tic-predominant Tourette syndrome while alpha agonists (e.g., guanfacine or clonidine) are used to treat patients with concurrent Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which is a common comorbidity.\nIn clinical practice, nonpharmacological interventions, such as comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) or habit reversal training, are preferred for mild to moderate tics, and pharmacotherapy is only initiated if behavioral interventions are unsuccessful.","bool":true},{"option":"Fluoxetine","explanation":"\nFluoxetine is an SSRI used to treat depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and somatic symptom disorder.

Incidence of somatic symptom disorder is higher in women and in those with a history of chronic childhood illness (e.g., asthma). After ruling out any treatable medical conditions, management consists of reducing unnecessary tests and procedures by scheduling regular appointments and establishing a therapeutic alliance with a single primary care physician.

He is placed on probation within the company and told that he must improve his performance on the next project to remain with the company. He is distraught and leaves his office early. When he gives an account of the episode to his wife, she says, “I'll always be proud of you no matter what because I know that you always try your best.” Later that night, he tearfully accuses her of believing that he is a failure.

He thereby extends his undesired feelings about himself to another person (see “Overview of pathological defenses” table).","bool":true},{"option":"Displacement","explanation":"Close! This patient's defense mechanism is similar to displacement (psychiatry), so you're on the right track. Displacement is a neurotic defense mechanism in which the affected individual redirects negative emotions about one person to a neutral third party (i.e., person or object), which is often a subordinate or less threatening entity. An example of displacement would be if the biochemist yelled at an intern for not showing enough initiative after having received negative feedback himself. In this case, the biochemist attributes emotions he has about himself to another person (his wife), which is better described by a different defense mechanism.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Transference","explanation":"\nTransference refers to the unconscious redirection of feelings (positive or negative) from a past experience (often from childhood) with one object to a current experience with another object that has a perceived or real similarity to the first object. Within the context of psychoanalysis, the term transference refers to the projection of unconscious feelings by the patient onto the therapist.","bool":false},{"option":"Denial","explanation":"\nDenial (psychiatry) involves a subconscious refusal to accept unpleasant aspects of a reality. For example, the biochemist would demonstrate denial if he showed up for work even after having been fired.","bool":false},{"option":"Passive aggression","explanation":"\nPassive aggression refers to the expression of negative feelings towards someone in a non-confrontational way.
