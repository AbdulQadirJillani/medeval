Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 88/58 mm Hg. Examination shows scattered petechiae and ecchymoses on the trunk and lower extremities. There is decreased range of motion of the neck. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a cell count of 1,600/μL (80% neutrophils) and a lactate concentration of 5.1 mmol/L. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This college student presents with symptoms of meningitis (headache, photophobia, neck stiffness). The CSF findings (elevated cell count, granulocytosis, markedly elevated lactate) are consistent with a bacterial etiology. The patient's myalgias, scattered petechial/ecchymotic rash, and hypotension are consistent with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, a dangerous coagulopathy most commonly associated with meningococcal meningitis that can lead to adrenal necrosis and subsequent adrenal failure.","answers":[{"option":"Polysaccharide conjugate vaccine","explanation":"\nNeisseria meningitidis is one of the most common causes of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults in the US. This patient is at high risk because crowded living conditions (e.g., college dormitories, military barracks, etc.) facilitate the spread of N. meningitidis. Meningococcal meningitis can be prevented by meningococcal vaccination. The meningococcal ACWY vaccine, a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, is usually given at 11 or 12 years of age with a booster dose at age 16 years. For individuals 10–25 years of age with risk factors for invasive meningococcal disease, the meningococcal B vaccine is also recommended. The pentavalent meningococcal vaccine can be considered for individuals 10–25 years of age in whom both meningitis ACWY and meningitis B vaccination are indicated at the same visit.","bool":true},{"option":"Live attenuated vaccine","explanation":"\nLive attenuated vaccines include the MMR vaccine, varicella vaccine, and intranasal influenza vaccine. Mumps and varicella can cause viral meningitis and measles can cause viral encephalitis, which are both associated with headache. However, in viral meningitis or encephalitis, CSF analysis would be expected to show a cell count of &lt; 500/μL with a lymphocytic predominance instead of the cell count of 1600/μL with granulocytosis seen here. In addition, the severity of the patient's symptoms is more consistent with a bacterial etiology.","bool":false},{"option":"Inactivated whole-cell vaccine","explanation":"Inactivated whole-cell vaccines are used in the prevention of, for example, polio (Salk vaccine), hepatitis A, and rabies. Rabies can cause encephalitis, which can present with symptoms similar to those seen in this patient (fever, headache, and lethargy). However, hydrophobia (a pathognomonic feature of rabies) would also be expected. In addition, CSF analysis of rabies would be expected to show a cell count of 5–30/μL instead of the cell count of 1,600/μL seen here. Lastly, rabies is transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal; no such history is given.\nAn inactivated virus vaccine is available for tick-borne encephalitis, which can present with symptoms similar to those of meningococcal meningitis (e.g., fever, headache, and lethargy). However, this disease is endemic only in Eastern Europe and Asia, and, even in endemic areas, the vaccine is only given to individuals with extensive outdoor exposure.","bool":false},{"option":"Toxoid vaccine","explanation":"\nToxoid vaccines are used to prevent tetanus and diphtheria. Although these diseases could explain some of this patient's symptoms (tetanus causes neck stiffness and diphtheria causes fever), they would not explain her headache, photophobia, and petechial/ecchymotic rash, all of which are suggestive of meningococcal meningitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Doxycycline therapy","explanation":"\nDoxycycline can be administered prophylactically to individuals traveling to malaria-endemic areas. Malaria typically causes a high fever with weakness, jaundice, and malaise. In the case of cerebral malaria, patients may present with confusion, delirium, and seizures. This patient's symptoms of neck stiffness, photophobia, and petechiae with abnormal CSF findings are much more consistent with a presentation of meningococcal meningitis.\nDoxycycline is also used for the treatment, not prophylaxis, of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), which can present with fever, hypotension, headache, myalgias, neck stiffness and a petechial rash. However, CSF would be expected to show a cell count of &lt;100/μL instead of the cell count of 1,600/μL seen here. Furthermore, RMSF is transmitted by tick bite; no such history of tick bite is provided for the patient, and she is less likely to have had a tick bite since she has not recently traveled outside of the large urban area where she attends college. (Most tick bites, but not all, occur in the countryside.)","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous vancomycin","explanation":"Intravenous vancomycin, in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin, is appropriate for covering gram-positive bacteria as part of the empiric treatment for community-acquired bacterial meningitis in otherwise healthy patients between the ages of 1 month and 50 years. However, it is not used as a prophylactic measure against bacterial meningitis; even if it were, vancomycin alone would not prevent meningitis caused by N. meningitidis, a gram-negative coccus.","bool":false},{"option":"Erythromycin therapy","explanation":"\nErythromycin therapy can be used as diphtheria prophylaxis for individuals in close contact with infected patients. Although diphtheria can cause fever, it usually also presents with sore throat and a greyish-white pharynx rather than with neck stiffness and photophobia.","bool":false},{"option":"Fluconazole therapy","explanation":"\nFluconazole can be used prophylactically to prevent cryptococcal meningitis. This patient has many characteristic symptoms of meningitis, including neck stiffness, photophobia, and fever. However, cryptococcal meningitis is highly unlikely in immunocompetent patients. In addition, the symptoms of cryptococcal meningitis typically worsen over the course of 1–2 weeks, not within hours. Finally, CSF analysis in cryptococcal meningitis would be expected to show a cell count of 20–200/μL with a lymphocytic predominance, instead of the cell count of 1,600/μL with granulocytosis seen here.","bool":false}]},{"id":1,"info":"Immune System","question":"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of recurrent skin lesions.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient presents with recurring respiratory infections, lymphadenopathy, and inflammatory, pustular lesions, starting at a very young age. Together, these features suggest impaired functioning of phagocytic cells, making him especially susceptible to infection with catalase-positive organisms (e.g., S. aureus, E. coli, Aspergillus).","answers":[{"option":"Defective NADPH oxidase","explanation":"The NADPH oxidase enzyme is responsible for the respiratory burst (oxidative burst) within phagolysosomes, a component of phagocytic cells, which causes a rapid release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can destroy bacteria. In patients with defective NADPH oxidase, also known as chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), this reaction does not occur. This leads to impaired function of phagocytic cells and makes patients susceptible to infection, as in this patient, usually with catalase-positive organisms. The nitroblue tetrazolium test and the dihydrorhodamine flow cytometry test are used to check for NADPH oxidase activity and to diagnose chronic granulomatous disease.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Impaired repair of double-strand DNA breaks","explanation":"Impaired repair of double-strand DNA breaks is seen in ataxia-telangiectasia.

Although patients with CHS may also present with recurrent (usually pyogenic) infections, features of CHS such as bleeding abnormalities, albinism, and neurologic dysfunction are missing in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Defective cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase","explanation":"A defect in Bruton tyrosine kinase, which is expressed in the cytoplasm of B cells, is seen in Bruton agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Although patients with XLA present with recurrent, severe pyogenic infections (e.g., pneumonia, otitis media), this patient does not show hypoplasia of the tonsils and other lymphoid tissues (due to very low levels of B cells). In addition, skin infections are not common in XLA, and this patient has had respiratory tract infections and recurrent fever since birth. Infections in XLA typically occur from 6 months onwards, when passive immunity from transplacental maternal IgG expires.","bool":false}]},{"id":2,"info":"Immune System","question":"A 12-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother 2 hours after cutting her hand while playing in the yard. Examination of the right hand shows a 2-cm laceration on the thenar region of the palm with some surrounding tenderness and erythema. The right palm appears mildly swollen in comparison to the left. In response to this patient's injury, the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels of the affected area express increased numbers of cellular adhesion molecules. Which of the following mediators is most likely directly responsible for the described change?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient exhibits three of the cardinal signs of inflammation: rubor (redness), tumor (swelling), and dolor (pain). In acute inflammation, neutrophils migrate to a site of infection or necrosis in a six-step process that includes margination, rolling, adhesion, transmigration, phagocytosis, and destruction. The immune mediator involved in the expression of cell adhesion molecules in the inflammation reaction is secreted by macrophages.","answers":[{"option":"Interleukin-1","explanation":"In the adhesion step of the acute inflammation process, IL-1 and TNF-alpha promote the upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules on the endothelium. These cellular adhesion molecules interact with integrins on leukocytes, leading to the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium.","bool":true},{"option":"Interleukin-6","explanation":"\nIL-6 is secreted by monocytes/macrophages. IL-6 induces fever and the production of several acute phase reactants, but it is not involved in the expression of cellular adhesion molecules during the process of neutrophil arrival in acute inflammation.","bool":false},{"option":"Interferon alpha","explanation":"\nIFN-α is a glycoprotein expressed by virus-infected and malignant cells. It is primarily involved in immune defense against viral infection and has no role in the acute inflammatory response.","bool":false},{"option":"Interleukin-8","explanation":"\nIL-8 is produced by macrophages, but it is not involved in the expression of cellular adhesion molecules. Its most important function is to attract neutrophils to a site of infection or necrosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Interleukin-10","explanation":"\nIL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Because IL-10 inhibits activated macrophages, it reduces (not increases) the expression of cell adhesion molecules.","bool":false},{"option":"Interferon gamma","explanation":"\nIFN-γ activates macrophages to destroy phagocytosed pathogens and induces the expression of MHC class II molecules.

Neutrophils store MPO in granules and then release it into the extracellular space where MPO has an antimicrobial effect. MPO has a heme moiety that would cause the color of the pus observed here. A similar color can be seen in Pseudomonas infections in which the greenish pigment pyoverdine is produced by the bacteria. However, pyogenic liver abscesses are rarely caused by Pseudomonas, and MPO is the most likely cause of the yellowish-green coloration.","bool":true},{"option":"Pyoverdine","explanation":"\nPyoverdine is a yellowish-green pigment produced and secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Unlike the organism isolated here, Pseudomonas spp. are non-lactose fermenters and seldom cause liver abscesses.","bool":false},{"option":"Prodigiosin","explanation":"\nProdigiosin is a red pigment produced by Serratia marcescens. Like E. coli and Klebsiella, S. marcescens is a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod and is not a common cause of liver abscesses. Furthermore, the pigment produced by S. marcescens would not cause pus to assume a yellowish-green color.","bool":false},{"option":"Sulfur granules","explanation":"\nSulfur granules cause the characteristic yellow discharge seen in actinomycosis. Actinomycosis is caused by the gram-positive bacillus Actinomyces israelii and usually manifests with orofacial, pelvic, or soft tissue infections rather than hepatic abscesses. Moreover, the presence of gram-negative rods on culture rules out actinomycosis in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"β-galactosidase","explanation":"\nβ-galactosidase is an enzyme produced by lactose-fermenting organisms such as E. coli. While this enzyme does cause colonies of lactose-fermenting bacteria to turn pink on MacConkey agar, it has no in vivo effect. It would therefore not account for the color of this patient's pus.","bool":false},{"option":"Staphyloxanthin","explanation":"\nStaphyloxanthin is responsible for the golden yellow color of pus in infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which are gram-positive cocci. While S. aureus is a common cause of pyogenic liver abscesses in children, it is seldom a cause of liver infections in adults.","bool":false},{"option":"Biliverdin","explanation":"\nBiliverdin is a green pigment formed by the breakdown of hemoglobin.

His exam findings and elevated CSF protein support a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome.","answers":[{"option":"Schwann cells","explanation":"\nGuillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune syndrome triggered by an antecedent infection, for example, Campylobacter enteritis (likely in this patient) or CMV infection. The most common subtype, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy (AIDP), likely arises from cross-reactivity between epitopes from the antecedent infection and the myelin in Schwann cells (also known as molecular mimicry), leading to immune-mediated destruction of Schwann cells and Schwann cell-produced myelin. Infiltration of leukocytes results in demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration that is worst at the peripheral nerve roots (radiculopathy) and can affect all nerve types (sensory, motor, sympathetic, parasympathetic).","bool":true},{"option":"Postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors","explanation":"\nAutoantibodies produced against postsynaptic AChR are the underlying cause of myasthenia gravis. The binding of antibodies to these receptors causes competitive inhibition that decreases the excitatory action of ACh.

Antigens penetrating the skin are phagocytosed by Langerhans cells, which subsequently migrate to the lymph nodes and there induce the formation of sensitized T lymphocytes. On a subsequent exposure, these presensitized T lymphocytes secrete lymphokines (e.g., interferon-γ) that induce macrophage-mediated tissue inflammation as seen in this patient.

A polymerase chain reaction test (PCR test) is used to diagnose HIV in children &lt; 18 months of age. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) cannot be used in children &lt; 18 months of age, because maternal HIV IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta, possibly leading to false-positive results.\nHIV testing is recommended for all pregnant women in the first trimester. In pregnant patients with HIV and an unknown viral load, scheduled cesarean delivery is usually recommended at 38 weeks' gestation to decrease the risk of vertical transmission. In mothers with HIV who have infants without HIV, breastfeeding should be avoided if possible. However, in resource-limited countries, breastfeeding may be considered.

A defect in the CD40 ligand renders T cells unable to switch IgM production in B cells to the production of other immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA, IgG, IgE), resulting in decreased IgA titers, as seen here, and decreased humoral immunity. The CD40 ligand defect also results in an inability of T cells to upregulate cells that express the CD40 molecule (e.g., B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells). Since these cells also happen to be cells that present antigens to T cells, the net effects are a decreased antigen-specific T-cell response and decreased cell-mediated immunity, which in turn increase the risk of infection by pathogens such as Pneumocystis. The onset of symptoms in type 1 hyper IgM syndrome can occur during early infancy and failure to thrive may occur as a result of recurrent infections.\nOther pathogens that infect patients with type 1 hyper-IgM syndrome with an increased frequency include Cryptosporidium parvum and Histoplasmosis. C. parvum enteritis results in chronic diarrhea, which can exacerbate failure to thrive. C. parvum also infects the biliary tract and leads to an increased risk of cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma.

Ketoconazole, an antifungal agent with antiinflammatory properties, is used to treat SD and topical steroids are used to control acute flares.","bool":true},{"option":"Allergic contact dermatitis","explanation":"\nAllergic contact dermatitis (ACD) can manifest with a pruritic, erythematous rash. However, this patient's rash is not limited to the parts of the skin he uses the shaving cream on; the scaly rash is also seen on his eyelids and forehead, and scales in ACD are dry and white rather than greasy and yellow. Moreover, ACD develops within 48 hours of contact with the allergen, and the 2-month period between this patient changing shaving cream and developing a rash is not consistent with this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Psoriasis","explanation":"Psoriatic lesions can manifest as pruritic erythematous scaly plaques that are recurrent with symptom-free intervals. However, the typical lesions will be sharply-demarcated with numerous silvery-white scales and have a predilection to occur on the scalp, back, and extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees. The characteristic silvery scales of a psoriatic lesion may be rubbed off while bathing or minimized with the use of lotions, making differentiating between psoriasis and this patient's condition difficult. It is helpful to consider nail changes, arthritis, and a family history of psoriasis if the lesions are indeterminate.","bool":false},{"option":"Dermatomyositis","explanation":"Cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis (DM) include midfacial erythema that affects the nasolabial folds and the eyelids (heliotrope rash), which is similar to the distribution of the rash seen in this patient. Although myopathy is an important and common symptom of DM, cutaneous features can precede the onset of myopathy.

CD4+ T cells then differentiate into Th1 cells, which release IFN-γ to recruit and activate macrophages. Activated macrophages differentiate into epithelioid cells, which aggregate and fuse into multinucleated giant cells (Langhans giant cells). Aggregation of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and CD4+ T cells around a necrotic cellular center leads to the formation of caseating granulomas, which are an important part of the human defense mechanism against mycobacterial infection.\nDiagnostic tests that evaluate for a type IV hypersensitivity reaction include tuberculin skin test, Candida extract test, and patch test.","bool":true},{"option":"Immune complex deposition","explanation":"\nImmune complex deposition is characteristic of type III hypersensitivity reactions.

There is no preceding history of fever, trauma, or insect bites. Her vital signs are within normal limits. A photograph of the tender lesions on her shins is shown. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Complete blood count and antistreptolysin O (ASO) titers are within the reference range. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 30 mm/h. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient presents with spontaneous onset of tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules on both shins that developed into bruise-like plaques without ulceration. These features are characteristic of erythema nodosum (EN), an inflammation of the subcutaneous fat (i.e., panniculitis) that is commonly preceded by or associated with a prodrome of malaise, and arthralgia.","answers":[{"option":"X-ray of the chest","explanation":"EN is thought to be due to a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to various circulating immune complexes. Most cases of EN are idiopathic, but it can be a cutaneous manifestation of an underlying/preceding systemic disease, most commonly streptococcal pharyngitis or sarcoidosis. The primary workup of every patient with EN should therefore include evaluation of CBC and ASO titers, which are normal in this patient. The elevated ESR could be indicative of a systemic illness. The next step is to obtain an x-ray of the chest to evaluate for the presence of hilar lymphadenopathy, a sign of underlying sarcoidosis, which commonly affects young women, such as this patient.\nBecause EN can be associated with tuberculosis, testing for latent tuberculosis (e.g., tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay) is also indicated at the time of diagnosis. Other known triggers of EN include inflammatory bowel disease (EN is the most common cutaneous manifestation of Crohn disease), pregnancy, malignancy (e.g., lymphoma), and infections (e.g., coccidioidomycosis, brucellosis, psittacosis, and gastroenteritis secondary to Yersinia, Salmonella, and Campylobacter).","bool":true},{"option":"Skin biopsy","explanation":"EN is a clinical diagnosis. A biopsy of the lesion is indicated only if atypical features are seen, such as ulceration or location other than the shins. The characteristic histopathologic finding is a septal panniculitis without vasculitis. Because this patient presents with typical features of EN, (i.e., bilaterally symmetrical, multiple, tender, nonulcerated subcutaneous nodules/plaques on the shins), a biopsy is not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Triamcinolone injection","explanation":"The lesions associated with EN usually resolve spontaneously within a few weeks. Intralesional steroid injections (e.g., with triamcinolone) are a treatment option for patients with severe pain despite treatment with NSAIDs.","bool":false},{"option":"Stool culture","explanation":"\nStool cultures are helpful in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal infections. Gastroenteritis secondary to Yersinia, Salmonella, and Campylobacter can cause EN. However, given the absence of diarrhea, nausea, or abdominal pain, this etiology is unlikely and, therefore, stool culture is not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral amoxicillin","explanation":"One of the most common conditions associated with EN is streptococcal pharyngitis, which can be treated with oral amoxicillin. However, this patient had no preceding complaints of a sore throat and has a normal CBC and ASO titers, making a streptococcal infection unlikely. Oral amoxicillin may be indicated for the treatment of subcutaneous abscesses that manifest as tender nodules, like in this case scenario. The lesions in this patient evolved into bruise-like lesions, however, which is a typical manifestation of EN. In addition, patients with subcutaneous infections would have signs of systemic disease (e.g., fever) and neutrophilic leukocytosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Antinuclear antibodies","explanation":"Serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA) indicate the presence of circulating autoantibodies. Highly elevated ANA levels are an indication of an underlying autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, or systemic sclerosis. This patient's ESR is elevated and she has malaise and joint pain, which could be a sign of an underlying autoimmune disease. EN is nonspecific and can occasionally occur in patients with an underlying autoimmune disease. However, ANA are not part of the routine diagnostic workup of EN.

Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient has had an anaphylactic reaction after ingesting fish. His skin prick test confirms a food allergy to salmon and cod. The physician's recommendation should take into account future reactions and potential cross-reactivity.","answers":[{"option":"Avoid all types of fish","explanation":"\nComplete avoidance of the food allergen and similar foods is the preferred management for patients with food allergies. Although this patient's skin prick test is positive only for salmon and cod, he should also avoid all other types of finned fish because of a high risk of cross-reactivity. In addition, he should be counseled on cross-contacts (e.g., in restaurants), food allergens in unexpected sources or nonfood items, food labeling, and aerosolized allergens (e.g., in steam from cooking). Furthermore, all patients with IgE-mediated food allergies should be provided with an anaphylaxis emergency action plan and at least one epinephrine autoinjector to treat accidental exposure. In this patient who would like to continue eating seafood, a follow-up evaluation for shellfish tolerance may be considered because the most common allergens in finned fish typically differ from the allergens in shellfish and his skin prick test shows no reactivity to shrimp.\nA new treatment approach for food allergies, oral immunotherapy (e.g., for peanut allergy), is currently being researched and consists of the ingestion of increasing doses of the allergen in a controlled setting in order to desensitize the immune system. This approach may allow patients with food allergies to continue eating allergenic foods in the future.","bool":true},{"option":"Take antihistamines one hour before eating fish","explanation":"Oral antihistamines can be used to treat mild allergic reactions such as urticaria, oral itch, or mild abdominal pain.

Furthermore, there is no recommendation that supports pretreatment with antihistamines in patients with IgE-mediated food allergies (e.g., fish allergy).","bool":false},{"option":"Inject intramuscular norepinephrine after eating fish","explanation":"Although intramuscular epinephrine is used in the management of severe IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis due to fish allergy), this medication is reserved for emergency situations such as accidental exposure because it carries a high risk of side effects.","bool":false},{"option":"Reduce the daily dietary amount of fish","explanation":"Reducing the amount of fish eaten daily is not an appropriate recommendation in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis caused by fish. This approach is insufficient because allergic reactions are typically triggered by even very small amounts of allergen.","bool":false},{"option":"Only consume long-boiled fish","explanation":"Some food allergens (especially milk and egg) are tolerated better when they are cooked or heated for a long time.

The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Administration of which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The eruption of an urticarial rash on the patient's penis shortly after protected sexual intercourse and history of a rash following exposure to balloons suggest a hypersensitivity reaction to latex.","answers":[{"option":"Oral cetirizine","explanation":"This patient's localized urticaria is consistent with a mild to moderate type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to latex, for which an H1-antihistamine such as cetirizine is indicated. Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions are caused by preformed IgE antibodies (from prior sensitization), which then activate rapid histamine release from mast cells upon reexposure to the antigen. Cetirizine competes with histamine at the H1 receptor to stabilize mast cells and is less sedating than first-generation antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine). This patient should also be advised to avoid contact with latex in the future.","bool":true},{"option":"Intravenous acyclovir","explanation":"Intravenous acyclovir is used to treat certain viral infections, e.g., herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. While HSV infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis in a sexually active patient presenting with a genital rash, the timing and appearance of his rash are not consistent with this diagnosis (HSV typically appears 2–7 days after exposure and is characterized by vesicles and ulcerations). Furthermore, oral acyclovir is preferred over IV administration for genital HSV infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral cromolyn sodium","explanation":"\nCromolyn sodium is a mast cell stabilizer most commonly administered as an inhaled solution for the treatment of asthma.

Low levels of secretory IgA in patients with SIgAD increase the risk of Giardia lamblia infection and sinopulmonary infections (e.g., due to H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae). In addition, patients with SIgAD are at an increased risk of autoimmune diseases like immune thrombocytopenia. This patient's uncontrolled nose bleed that required a platelet transfusion may indicate that he has autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Low serum IgA with normal IgG and IgM concentrations confirms the diagnosis of SIgAD.\nIn rare cases, individuals with SIgAD may form anti-IgA antibodies, which increase their risk of developing anaphylaxis following a transfusion with blood products containing IgA (e.g., platelet transfusions, RBC transfusions).

Mycobacteria are transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets. Once inside the alveoli, the bacteria are ingested by alveolar macrophages and those bacteria that successfully escape the phagolysosome fusion then begin to replicate within the macrophages.

These findings, together with a family history of recurrent orofacial swelling, are indicative of hereditary angioedema (HAE), a disease caused by deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor.","answers":[{"option":"Agonist at alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors","explanation":"\nEpinephrine, a dual α and β-adrenergic agonist, is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis associated with allergic or mast cell-mediated angioedema. Abdominal pain can also occur in some cases of anaphylaxis, most commonly with a known food allergen. However, anaphylaxis usually has an acute onset (within minutes to hours of exposure to an antigen), is rapidly progressive, and would present with additional system involvement (hypotension, pruritus, and urticaria). Epinephrine does not improve airway-associated symptoms in acute angioedema attacks in patients with HAE.","bool":false},{"option":"Antagonist at bradykinin receptor","explanation":"The autosomal dominant defect in patients with HAE causes a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor, which physiologically suppresses steps in the complement pathways and inactivates kallikrein. Because kallikrein normally converts kininogen to bradykinin, increased levels of kallikrein lead to a buildup of bradykinin, with resultant vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and eventual angioedema. First-line therapies for HAE focus on antagonizing the bradykinin B2 receptor (icatibant), replacing the defective enzyme with intravenous injection of purified C1-INH, or preventing further generation of bradykinin with a kallikrein inhibitor (ecallantide).\nTrauma, dental work, and mental or physical stress are common triggers for these acute attacks.","bool":true},{"option":"Antagonist at histamine receptor","explanation":"\nAntihistamines are used to treat patients presenting with mast cell-mediated angioedema (without anaphylaxis).

Hyper-IgE syndrome is caused by a mutation in the STAT3 gene, which leads to Th17 cell deficiency and decreased interferon-γ production by helper T cells. The lack of interferon-γ results in impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, causing patients to present with cold abscesses and recurrent sinopulmonary infections (e.g., pneumonia). Affected individuals also develop eczema (resembling atopic dermatitis) within the first few weeks of life.

It is typically the cause of influenza epidemics.","answers":[{"option":"Random point mutations within viral genome","explanation":"Random point mutations within the viral genome are responsible for antigenic drift, which creates a new virus strain. In some cases, although the patient has been vaccinated against the previous strain, the new strain will have different antigenic properties that can evade the host immune response and cause an infection, as observed in this patient.","bool":true},{"option":"Reassortment of viral RNA segments","explanation":"During coinfection, two different viruses can exchange unlinked segments of RNA in a process known as reassortment. However, genetic reassortment, which is considered a subtype of recombination, leads to larger genetic changes that can cause pandemics (i.e., antigenic shift). An example is the reassortment of the human influenza A virus with swine influenza virus, which caused the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

The interaction of B7 (on the dendritic cell) and CD28 ligands (on the T cell) serves as the secondary signaling necessary for T-cell activation, maturation, and proliferation. Inactivation or improper costimulation of these ligands will lead to T-cell anergy. In clinical practice, this impaired activation is manifested as a negative TST, as seen in this patient with HIV, which is directly related to decreasing CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. IL-2 also plays an important role in T-cell activation, as T-cell anergy can also be functionally defined as a state of hyporesponsiveness in which T cells neither proliferate nor produce IL-2 following TCR ligation.

Impaired T-cell function increases the risk of recurrent infections (e.g., otitis media). In the early stages, thrombocytopenia is caused by increased platelet destruction in the spleen. A combination of thrombocytopenia and intrinsic platelet defects result in purpura and recurrent rectal bleeding with anemia due to blood loss. The mechanism causing eczema, another classic feature of WAS, is unknown, but it is probably the result of a hyperallergic state associated with increased IgE levels. Failure to thrive is a common manifestation of most primary immunodeficiency disorders that affect T lymphocytes.\nPatients with WAS are also at increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia, arthritis) and childhood hematological malignancies (e.g., lymphoma, leukemia). Treatment includes supportive therapy in the form of regular IVIG infusions, adequate nutrition, platelet transfusions for bleeding episodes, and early treatment of eczema. Definitive therapy is stem cell transplantation. For patients who cannot undergo definitive treatment and have recurrent episodes of severe thrombocytopenia, splenectomy may be considered.

Identification of the allergen is the initial step because trigger avoidance is the most effective measure to prevent subsequent episodes. Food allergens are the most common cause of anaphylaxis in children. This child's allergic reaction occurred while he was eating lunch, which makes a food allergen highly likely.\nIdentifying the allergen requires testing performed by an allergist. Although in vivo skin testing is quicker, cheaper, and more sensitive than in vitro testing, it should be avoided in patients with recent anaphylaxis (i.e., within the previous month). Instead, these patients should undergo in vitro testing.","bool":true},{"option":"Epinephrine autoinjector","explanation":"\nEpinephrine autoinjectors are prescribed to patients with previous anaphylactic reactions as an emergency plan for recurrences.

IgE antibodies from a previous encounter with a certain antigen are bound to mast cells and basophils. Re-exposure leads to degranulation of IgE-coated mast cells with release of histamine and various other mediators responsible for the characteristic features of type I HSR (i.e., erythema, pruritus, and urticaria). The patient's hypotension is due to hypovolemia caused by peripheral vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.","bool":true},{"option":"Secretion of cytokines by T cells","explanation":"Secretion of cytokines by T cells is essential for type IV hypersensitivity reactions, which result from delayed, cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Sensitization of CD4+ T cells to antigens (i.e., allergens) takes place via presentation by Langerhans cells in lymph nodes. Re-exposure to an antigen induces secretion of cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ) and subsequent activation of macrophages and T killer cells. However, this patient developed symptoms shortly after antigen exposure, which is inconsistent with a type IV HSR.","bool":false},{"option":"Deficiency of C1 inhibitor","explanation":"Deficiency of C1 inhibitor is the underlying pathology of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which can be inherited or acquired. Lack of C1 inhibitor results in the unrestricted production of bradykinin, which mediates vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. Symptoms typically present as facial edema after a triggering event (e.g., ACE-inhibitor administration, infection), but do not include the urticaria or hypotension seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Activation of complement cascade","explanation":"Activation of the complement cascade via binding of antibodies to cell surface antigens plays a major role in type II hypersensitivity reactions. Complement-mediated cell lysis and activation of NK cells and macrophages via their Fc receptors cause this inflammatory reaction. Common type II HSRs include hemolytic transfusion reactions, but instant allergic reactions upon intake of a certain drug, as seen in this patient, are not mediated by the complement cascade.","bool":false},{"option":"Deposition of immune complexes","explanation":"\nImmune complex deposition occurs with type III hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., serum sickness or vasculitis). Antibodies develop in response to a specific antigen, resulting in the formation of antigen-antibody immune complexes following second exposure.

A delay in initiating intramuscular epinephrine is associated with increased mortality in patients with anaphylaxis. 1:1000 epinephrine should not be administered intravenously; intravenous administration of this highly concentrated form of epinephrine has a high risk of cardiovascular complications (e.g., arrhythmias). Intramuscular administration is preferred over subcutaneous administration because it reaches therapeutic levels in target tissues more quickly.","bool":true},{"option":"Administer nebulized albuterol","explanation":"\nAlbuterol can be administered for severe bronchospasm after the initial treatment of anaphylaxis.

Consequently, host neutrophils rely on the hydrogen peroxide produced by bacteria rather than on oxygen as a precursor to bactericidal reactive oxygen species. Catalase-producing organisms such as Serratia marcescens, however, are able to metabolize their own hydrogen peroxide. This deprives CGD host neutrophils of the substrate needed to form reactive oxygen species, predisposing patients to infection with such bacteria.\nOther important catalase-positive organisms that commonly cause infections in CGD include S. aureus, Nocardia spp., Aspergillus, and B. cepacia.

Patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia can be positive for rheumatoid factor (RF) because the IgM in mixed cryoglobulinemia has the activity of RF. The RF-like activity of IgM also causes decreased complement levels because the IgM binds to the Fc portion of IgG and causes complement activation.","answers":[{"option":"Hepatitis C serology","explanation":"About 90% of cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia are associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It is thought that the immune reaction to HCV causes the formation of immune complexes with HCV antigen, which subsequently trigger complement activation and inflammation of blood vessels, resulting in palpable purpura (due to cryoglobulinemic vasculitis). Immune-complex mediated damage is also responsible for polyarthralgia. Since mixed cryoglobulinemia can be the initial manifestation of an otherwise asymptomatic HCV infection, it is important to test all patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia for hepatitis C regardless of liver function tests to ensure that early therapy can be initiated.\nOther important causes for mixed cryoglobulinemia are autoimmune diseases (especially Sjogren disease and SLE). A negative ANA test makes these diagnoses less likely. Severe mixed cryoglobulinemia can also cause glomerulonephritis, liver dysfunction, and polyneuropathy.
