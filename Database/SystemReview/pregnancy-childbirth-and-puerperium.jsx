She had a spontaneous abortion at 11 weeks' gestation 9 months ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. On pelvic examination, there is old blood in the vaginal vault and at the closed cervical os. There are bilateral adnexal masses. Serum β-hCG concentration is 122,000 mIU/ml. Results from dilation and curettage show hydropic chorionic villi and proliferation of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. There are no embryonic parts. Vaginal ultrasound shows that both ovaries are enlarged and have multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the ovarian findings?","difficulty":3,"hint":"These cysts result from ovarian hyperstimulation due to high levels of hCG and prolactin in patients with complete molar pregnancy.","answers":[{"option":"Theca lutein cysts","explanation":"\nTheca lutein cysts arise from increased gonadotropin levels, most commonly beta-hCG. They are a common finding in complete moles, as an increased beta-hCG level is a typical finding of gestational trophoblastic disease. Theca lutein cysts are also associated with multiple pregnancies, infertility treatment with gonadotropins, or PCOS. These benign cysts often occur bilaterally, have thin walls and clear content, and usually resolve spontaneously within 2–4 months. In molar pregnancy, β-HCG levels should be monitored until values reach the normal reference range (usually 8–12 weeks).","bool":true},{"option":"Corpus luteum cysts","explanation":"\nCorpus luteum cysts usually disappear at the end of the 2nd trimester. Additionally, corpus luteum cysts have a thick, rather than a thin wall, and often show peripheral blood vessels, which is not the case in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Serous cystadenomas","explanation":"\nSerous cystadenomas are the most common ovarian tumor and frequently occur bilaterally. They can also appear as thin-walled and multiseptate on ultrasound, making serous cystadenoma an important differential diagnosis. Considering the patient had an abortion 9 months ago (when an ultrasound examination was presumably performed), it would be unlikely for such a widespread tumor to develop in the meantime. Furthermore, complete molar pregnancies are not associated with an increased risk of serous cystadenoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Follicular cyst","explanation":"\nFollicular cysts are the most common type of ovarian cysts. Follicular cysts are usually asymptomatic unless complications occur (e.g., ovarian cyst rupture). Although follicular cysts are thin-walled and filled with clear fluid, they occur most commonly during ovulation, which is not the case in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Dermoid cyst","explanation":"\nDermoid cysts are the most common type of germ cell tumors (90% of cases). These tumors can contain any type of tissue, particularly tissue derived from ectodermal origin (e.g., hair, teeth, and sebaceous glands). Complete molar pregnancies are not associated with an increased risk of dermoid cysts.

Sodium retention and blood volume expansion are some of the most important hemodynamic adaptations that occur during pregnancy. In many healthy women, this adaptation will lead to peripheral edema that manifests as swollen legs. In later stages of pregnancy, this can worsen as the gravid uterus can compress the inferior vena cava and the iliac veins. Similarly, subjective shortness of breath, fatigue, and a third heart sound are seen in most healthy pregnancies, especially in the later stages.","bool":true},{"option":"D-dimer level","explanation":"The D-dimer level is used to rule out pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) when clinical likelihood is low but worrisome symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath and/or chest pain) are present. Although this patient presents with lower extremity edema, it is not unilateral as would be expected from a DVT. Her heart rate, respirations, and blood pressure are also all within normal range, which makes pulmonary embolism less likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Echocardiography","explanation":"\nEchocardiography is a useful test for diagnosing heart failure or cardiac disease. Although this patient presents with peripheral edema, a third heart sound, and shortness of breath, these are common findings in healthy pregnancies.

The exam will often have questions in which some options have some degree of truth. In this case, it is important to recognize that although urinalysis is an essential part of prenatal checkups for detecting bacteriuria or proteinuria (e.g., indicating pre-eclampsia), screening for proteinuria is not warranted as the next best step of management for this patient's symptoms because she is normotensive. Her lower extremity edema and shortness of breath are common findings in healthy pregnancies. Additional workup for pre-eclampsia would not be warranted unless she developed worrisome findings (e.g., hypertension, facial edema, weight gain, headache, visual symptoms, or oliguria). With that said, a urinalysis would likely be conducted in this patient to rule out asymptomatic bacteriuria as part of her routine prenatal visit.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Lower extremity doppler","explanation":"A lower extremity doppler is a highly sensitive ultrasound test used for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pregnancy increases the risk of DVT. Although DVT may present with lower extremity edema, it is generally confined to one leg and also presents with warmth and tenderness.

A decrease in ACTH causes secondary adrenal insufficiency with decreased cortisol production, which leads to decreased vascular tone. With severe pituitary infarction, panhypopituitarism can occur and patients can develop hypovolemia as a result of decreased ADH production (central diabetes insipidus). These changes are responsible for hypotension in Sheehan syndrome. Aldosterone production is not directly under the control of ACTH or ADH and is primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

The findings of dilated small bowel loops on abdominal x-ray and a microcolon indicate meconium ileus as the cause for obstruction and explains why he has not yet passed stool.","answers":[{"option":"Gastrografin enema","explanation":"\nGastrografin enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic for meconium ileus. A gastrografin enema will allow visualization of the rectum and bowel to rule out other anatomical causes for bowel obstruction (e.g., intestinal atresia or volvulus) and, in the case of meconium ileus, can reveal the Neuhauser sign, microcolon, or meconium pellets. The contrast agent can also induce a laxative effect as the increase of osmolarity within the lumen of the bowel results in the breakdown and passage of the meconium obstruction.\nMore than 90% of patients with meconium ileus will have cystic fibrosis (CF).

This finding is characteristic of late decelerations.","answers":[{"option":"Placental insufficiency","explanation":"\nPlacental insufficiency causes oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth restriction (as evidenced by uterine size being too small for gestational age in this case). Since the fetoplacental reserve is decreased in placental insufficiency, stressors, such as labor, can cause fetal hypoxia and metabolic acidosis, which are seen as late decelerations, as in this patient. Gestational hypertension is a common cause of uteroplacental insufficiency. Late decelerations are a sign of fetal distress and should be managed with intrauterine resuscitation and immediate delivery of the fetus.","bool":true},{"option":"Umbilical cord compression","explanation":"\nUmbilical cord compression is more common in women with oligohydramnios because of the lack of an amniotic fluid cushion to protect the umbilical cord from being compressed between the fetus and the contracting uterus.

Her history of recurrent joint pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia, increased PTT, and elevated creatinine suggests systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).","answers":[{"option":"Placental thrombosis","explanation":"This patient's examination findings are most likely caused by APS secondary to SLE. Patients with APS form procoagulant antibodies (anticardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein 1, and lupus anticoagulant antibodies) that can lead to placental thrombosis and consequent miscarriage. To establish the diagnosis of APS, serology for antiphospholipid antibodies should be performed.","bool":true},{"option":"Chromosomal abnormalities","explanation":"\nChromosomal abnormalities are the most common fetal cause for spontaneous abortions, particularly in the 1st and early 2nd trimester. Although a chromosomal abnormality cannot be definitively ruled out, more common chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome) are likely to be detected during the first-trimester screening. This patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a different underlying condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Velamentous cord insertion","explanation":"\nVelamentous cord insertion increases the risk for rupture of the cord vessels with subsequent fetal hypoxia, especially if the fetal membranes rupture. While this condition presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding in the mother and can cause fetal death, it usually does not present until the 3rd trimester.","bool":false},{"option":"Placenta previa","explanation":"\nPlacenta previa usually presents in the 3rd trimester with sudden onset of painless, bright red vaginal bleeding that stops spontaneously after 1–2 hours.

Other agents (e.g., codeine, caffeine) may be combined with acetaminophen if monotherapy does not result in a sufficient improvement. Associated nausea and vomiting can be treated with antiemetics such as meclizine, diphenhydramine, promethazine, metoclopramide, or ondansetron.","bool":true},{"option":"Ergotamine","explanation":"\nErgot derivatives, such as ergotamine, are first-line agents for the acute management of severe migraines in nonpregnant patients. However, they are contraindicated during pregnancy because of vasoconstrictive effects on uteroplacental vessels and increased uterotonic activity, both of which can contribute to fetal growth retardation and intrauterine fetal demise.","bool":false},{"option":"Sumatriptan","explanation":"\nTriptans, such as sumatriptan, are first-line agents for the acute management of severe migraines in nonpregnant patients. However, triptans should only be considered as a third-line treatment during pregnancy because of their potential vasoconstrictive effect on uteroplacental vessels and increased uterotonic activity, both of which can contribute to fetal growth retardation and intrauterine fetal demise.","bool":false},{"option":"Oxycodone","explanation":"\nOpioids, such as oxycodone, can be used as an alternative for the acute management of migraines in pregnant women who do not respond to first- and second-line therapy. Nonetheless, the use of opioids during pregnancy is limited because of their high potential for maternal addiction and neonatal withdrawal. In addition, opioids should be avoided in this patient with nausea because they are emetogenic.","bool":false},{"option":"Ibuprofen","explanation":"\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are a second-line option for the acute management of migraines before 20 weeks' gestation. However, NSAIDs should be avoided after 20 weeks' gestation because of their vasoconstrictive properties, which could lead to premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus, fetal kidney dysfunction (and consequent oligohydramnios), persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, necrotizing enterocolitis, or intracranial hemorrhage.","bool":false}]},{"id":38,"info":"Pregnancy, Childbirth and Puerperium","question":"A 37-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 35 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of continuous, dark, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain for one hour.

Which of the following is the cause of fetal compromise?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient presents with dark red vaginal bleeding associated with abdominal tenderness and a nonreassuring fetal status (tachycardia, decelerations). These clinical findings, especially in association with the mother's hypertension, are characteristic of a specific obstetrical emergency.","answers":[{"option":"Detachment of the placenta","explanation":"\nDetachment of the placenta (placental abruption) causes rupture of the placental vessels (mainly maternal). The resulting hemorrhage can either dissect between the membranes and the myometrial wall into the vagina causing the characteristic dark red vaginal bleeding (revealed placental abruption) or dissect into the myometrial wall, resulting in a tense, tender uterus and hypertonic contractions (concealed placental abruption) or both (mixed placental abruption). The detached segment of the placenta is unable to exchange gases and nutrients, which can lead to fetal distress. Since there are signs of fetal distress, an emergency cesarean delivery is indicated in this patient.","bool":true},{"option":"Rupture of aberrant fetal vessels","explanation":"Rupture of aberrant fetal vessels (overlying the cervical os) occurs in vasa previa when the membranes rupture and is characterized by painless bright red vaginal bleeding. Since the bleeding is mainly fetal, vasa previa rapidly causes fetal distress. However, the presence of dark red vaginal bleeding and uterine tenderness in this patient, especially with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, makes another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Rupture of the uterus","explanation":"A previous cesarean delivery is an important risk factor for uterine rupture, which can also manifest with antepartum hemorrhage, abdominal pain and tenderness (due to peritoneal irritation by blood), and nonreassuring fetal status. However, patients with uterine rupture are hemodynamically unstable (tachycardia and hypotension) and examination would show a characteristic absence of uterine contractions and loss of station of the presenting fetal part. The presence of hypertonic uterine contractions and obvious fetal presentation makes uterine rupture an unlikely cause of fetal distress in this case.","bool":false},{"option":"Placental tissue covering the cervical os","explanation":"Rupture of maternal (and rarely, fetal) placental vessels as the cervix dilates during labor can cause antepartum hemorrhage and fetal distress in patients with placenta previa. However, the bleeding of placenta previa is characteristically bright red and painless. The presence of dark red blood and abdominal tenderness on examination make placenta previa an unlikely cause of fetal distress in this case.","bool":false},{"option":"Abnormal position of the fetus","explanation":"\nBreech presentation can be associated with fetal distress, due to cord prolapse/compression. Also, breech presentation is more common in patients with placenta previa (since the lower segment of the uterus is occupied by the placenta), which in turn can present with antepartum hemorrhage. However, the bleeding would then characteristically be bright red and painless. The presence of dark red blood and abdominal tenderness on examination make placenta previa an unlikely cause of nonreassuring fetal status in this case.","bool":false}]},{"id":39,"info":"Pregnancy, Childbirth and Puerperium","question":"Sixteen hours after delivery, a newborn develops respiratory distress. She was born at 38 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 3200 g (7 lb 1 oz). Pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios. Physical examination shows tachypnea and bluish discoloration of the extremities. Auscultation of the chest shows diffuse crackles in the lung fields and a harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Abdominal x-ray shows absence of bowel gas. Which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this newborn's condition?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient's respiratory distress shortly after birth, cyanosis, and crackles on lung auscultation are concerning for an aspiration phenomenon. The harsh holosystolic murmur over the left lower sternal border is consistent with a ventricular septal defect. Polyhydramnios during pregnancy and lack of bowel gas on imaging are suggestive of a diagnosis of esophageal atresia.","answers":[{"option":"Defect in mesodermal differentiation","explanation":"This patient's symptoms of respiratory distress and auscultatory findings are most likely caused by an aspiration, which can occur due to a tracheoesophageal fistula. Combined with esophageal atresia and a ventricular septal defect, these malformations suggest a VACTERL association, which is caused by defective mesodermal development. Other VACTERL features include vertebral defects, anal atresia, renal defects, and limb defects.","bool":true},{"option":"Deficiency of phosphatidylcholine","explanation":"Decreased phosphatidylcholine production is common in premature infants (&lt; 36 weeks) and causes neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). However, this infant was born at 38 weeks, at which point her lungs have likely reached a sufficient degree of maturation. Additionally, maternal polyhydramnios, a harsh holosystolic murmur at the tricuspid area, and a lack of bowel gas on imaging are not characteristic features of NRDS. Instead, NRDS is associated with a continuous murmur best heard in the interscapular region (due to a patent ductus arteriosus) and/or features of necrotizing enterocolitis on abdominal x-ray (e.g., pneumatosis intestinalis, free air in the abdomen).","bool":false},{"option":"Deletion in the long arm of chromosome 22","explanation":"\nDiGeorge syndrome can cause a harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border due to a ventricular septal defect (associated with conotruncal anomalies) as well as respiratory distress and cyanosis.

Moreover, the absence of bowel gas on imaging is not consistent with DiGeorge syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane","explanation":"A defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane is responsible for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which can cause features of respiratory distress shortly after birth. However, in patients with CDH, examination would show diminished or absent breath sounds in the one lung field (typically the left) and a chest x-ray would reveal bowel loops in the lung field with diminished breath sounds. These features are not reported in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Absence of dynein","explanation":"The absence of functional dynein is responsible for Kartagener syndrome, which can cause respiratory distress due to LRTI as a result of impaired mucociliary clearance. However, the onset of respiratory distress in the immediate postnatal period, the presence of a harsh systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border (tricuspid area), and features of esophageal atresia such as absence of bowel gas are not consistent with Kartagener syndrome. Instead, examination would show heart sounds over the right precordium as a result of dextrocardia (situs inversus).","bool":false},{"option":"Deletion in the long arm of chromosome 7","explanation":"A microdeletion in the long arm of chromosome 7 is responsible for Williams syndrome, which can manifest with a systolic murmur due to supravalvular aortic stenosis and features of respiratory distress due to heart failure. However, the murmur of aortic stenosis would be best heard at the right upper sternal border (aortic area), and heart failure typically occurs during early childhood, not during the neonatal period.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Decelerations occurring in ≥ 50% of uterine contractions in a 20-minute period are known as recurrent variable decelerations and suggest umbilical cord compression.","answers":[{"option":"Maternal repositioning and oxygen administration","explanation":"In patients with suspected umbilical cord compression, intrauterine resuscitation measures should be initiated as soon as possible. Maternal repositioning (e.g., knee-chest or Trendelenburg position) helps relieve compression of the umbilical cord, and administration of oxygen and fluids improves uteroplacental blood flow and fetal oxygenation. Filling the bladder with saline may also help with the elevation of the presenting part of the fetus, thereby relieving compression of the umbilical cord.","bool":true},{"option":"Elective cesarean delivery","explanation":"An elective cesarean delivery is indicated in cases in which vaginal delivery is likely to be complicated (e.g., uterine abnormalities, fetal macrosomia), to prevent transmission of maternal infections to the fetus (e.g., HIV), and, in rare cases, if the mother wishes it (e.g., strong fear of a painful birth). Since this infant shows recurrent variable decelerations, which can progress to life-threatening bradycardia, immediate treatment is required.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Rapid amnioinfusion","explanation":"Rapid amnioinfusion provides an extra cushion of fluid around the umbilical cord. While this may improve the symptoms suggestive of umbilical cord compression seen here (recurrent variable decelerations on cardiotocography), it is not the first step in management.","bool":false},{"option":"Emergency cesarean delivery","explanation":"Emergency cesarean delivery is indicated if the mother's and/or baby's life are at risk, such as in cases of suspected placental separation or uterine rupture, severe fetal bradycardia, and fetal acidosis.

While the alpha subunit is identical to that of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), the beta subunit is unique to hCG. Pregnancy tests function by detecting the unique beta subunit in the urine or blood. Levels of hCG peak in the first trimester of pregnancy.","answers":[{"option":"Maintenance of the corpus luteum","explanation":"In women who are not pregnant, the corpus luteum degenerates approximately 10 days after ovulation and the subsequent fall in progesterone is responsible for the shedding of uterine endometrium during menstruation. If fertilization and implantation occur, hCG, which is secreted by syncytiotrophoblasts, maintains the corpus luteum for at least another 6 weeks in order to prevent expulsion of the products of conception. After this period, progesterone production by the placenta reaches high enough levels that the uterine endometrium is no longer dependent on the progesterone produced by the corpus luteum (luteal-placental shift).\nOther functions of hCG during pregnancy include stimulation of the maternal thyroid to produce thyroid hormone, stimulation of adrenal and placental steroidogenesis, secretion of relaxin from the corpus luteum, stimulation of Leydig cells of the male fetal testis to produce testosterone, and prevention of immunological rejection of the fetus.","bool":true},{"option":"Hypertrophy of the uterine myometrium","explanation":"\nHypertrophy of the uterine myometrium during pregnancy is caused by a combination of estrogen and progesterone. hCG can indirectly increase progesterone secretion, but it does not directly affect the uterine endometrium, where gonadotropin receptors that bind to hCG (LHCGR) are present in very low concentrations.","bool":false},{"option":"Preparation of the uterine endometrium for implantation","explanation":"\nProgesterone prepares the uterine endometrium for implantation. hCG can indirectly increase progesterone secretion, but it does not directly affect the uterine endometrium, where gonadotropin receptors that bind to hCG (LHCGR) are present in very low concentrations.","bool":false},{"option":"Development of breast tissue","explanation":"Growth and development of breast tissue during pregnancy is stimulated by a combination of estrogen, progesterone, and human placental lactogen.

The direct effect of hCG in an individual who is not pregnant is the induction of ovulation (similar to the action of LH). In fact, hCG was used in the past to induce ovulation in patients being treated for infertility. However, the use of hCG is associated with a significant risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and safer GnRH agonists are now preferred.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of preterm uterine contractions","explanation":"Uterine quiescence during gestation is caused by progesterone.

Manifestations of GTD include vaginal bleeding, hyperemesis gravidarum, and early-onset preeclampsia (gestational hypertension with proteinuria).","answers":[{"option":"Suction curettage","explanation":"The first step in the treatment of a partial or complete hydatidiform mole is the surgical evacuation of trophoblastic and/or fetal tissue by suction and curettage, followed by histological examination. In the immediate postprocedural period, arterial oxygen saturation should be monitored if the patient had a uterine size &gt; 14 weeks' gestation prior to evacuation because severe uterine enlargement is associated with an increased risk of postprocedural pulmonary complications (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome). Rh-negative patients should also receive anti-D prophylaxis. Subsequently, serial assays of serum beta-hCG should be performed (weekly until 3 consecutive assays are negative for beta-hCG, and then monthly for 6 months). Patients must be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during this period. If beta-hCG values do not decrease, if histological features of malignant GTD are present, or if metastases are present on chest x-ray, chemotherapy with methotrexate is indicated.","bool":true},{"option":"Oxytocin infusion","explanation":"In a patient with GTD, an oxytocin infusion should be administered if life-threatening vaginal bleeding occurs. In the absence of such bleeding, the use of oxytocin should be avoided; contraction of the uterus can force trophoblastic tissue into the venous spaces of the placental bed, causing systemic dissemination of GTD.

Which of the following best explains the clinical findings found in this newborn?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This newborn's symptoms are most likely associated with maternal folate deficiency.","answers":[{"option":"Maternal phenytoin therapy","explanation":"\nFetal hydantoin syndrome is a collection of defects associated with maternal exposure to phenytoin and other hydantoins (e.g., fosphenytoin). Use of these medications interferes with folate metabolism which often induces a deficiency. Common features of fetal hydantoin syndrome include intrauterine growth restriction, craniofacial abnormalities (e.g., cleft palate, hypertelorism, slanted palpebral fissures, and low-set ears), a short neck, limb defects (phalanx/fingernail hypoplasia), and excessive hair on the body and face. Other manifestations include cardiac anomalies (e.g., ventricular septal defect), ocular defects, hypospadias, and umbilical and inguinal hernias. Treatment is largely supportive and includes surgery to fix the cleft palate in addition to special education.\nFetal hydantoin syndrome does not typically manifest with neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida), which are usually seen in other types of folate deficiency and may occur as a result of maternal use of other anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or valproate (see “Overview of antiepileptics to avoid during pregnancy” table).","bool":true},{"option":"Fetal X chromosome monosomy","explanation":"\nMonosomy of the X chromosome leads to Turner syndrome, which may cause a webbed neck and low-set ears in a female newborn.

Vaginal delivery (without oxytocin) is recommended even in hemodynamically unstable patients if there are signs of imminent vaginal delivery (no rupture on membranes, no crowning). This patient does not fulfill the criteria for a trial of vaginal delivery. Oxytocin can worsen this patient's hemodynamic instability by causing hypotension and reflex tachycardia. Oxytocin can also worsen fetal distress by augmenting uterine contractions, which, in turn, worsen uteroplacental insufficiency (uteroplacental flow transiently decreases with each uterine contraction).","bool":false},{"option":"Administration of nifedipine","explanation":"\nTocolytics (e.g., nifedipine) are useful in delaying the delivery of a preterm fetus (&lt; 34 weeks' gestation) in patients with abruptio placentae who are in preterm labor, but only if the mother is hemodynamically stable and there is no evidence of fetal distress. Delaying the delivery of a preterm fetus by 24–48 hours gives an opportunity for corticosteroid administration to improve fetal lung maturity and decrease the risk of neonatal respiratory distress. However, this patient has contraindications for tocolysis: severe abruptio placentae, maternal hemodynamic instability, gestational age ≥ 34 weeks, and fetal distress.

This risk persists even years after treatment for an eating disorder, most likely due to residual symptoms. Asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction typically occurs in the late 2nd or early 3rd trimester, affecting fetal growth rather than organ formation.

Umbilical cord entanglement occurs in almost all monoamniotic twin pregnancies due to the close insertion of the umbilical cords on the chorionic surface. Knotting of the cord is often present in the first trimester. Free movement of both twins may cause tightening at any time during the pregnancy, resulting in cord compression and occlusion of the umbilical blood vessels. Intermittent disruption of blood flow may impair fetal growth and increase the risk of neurologic morbidity. A prolonged occlusion may result in fetal demise.

Because it descends along the lateral side of the popliteal fossa to the head of the fibula, the common peroneal nerve is susceptible to injury during obstetric procedures (See “Obstetric nerve injuries” table). It is likely that this nerve was accidentally compressed during childbirth, especially given the prolonged second stage of labor.\nTreatment of peroneal nerve injuries involves removal of the underlying cause (loosening a tight-fitting cast, avoidance of sitting cross-legged). Symptoms are usually self-limited once the cause of the compression is removed. In some cases, corticosteroids may be recommended to reduce swelling and inflammation that is causing compression of the nerve. If the symptoms persist, surgical decompression may be necessary.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury","explanation":"Because of its location in the pelvis under the inguinal ligament, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is at risk of injury from compression due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from pregnancy, obesity, or prolonged pushing with hip flexion during labor.

Initially, serum hCG levels increase exponentially, doubling every 2.5 days, until they slow down, peak at week 8–10 of gestation, and then decline to reach a plateau at around week 20 of gestation. hCG is structurally similar to luteinizing hormone (identical α subunit) and maintains the corpus luteum, which accounts for increasing progesterone and estrogen levels during the first weeks of pregnancy. Progesterone and estrogen are essential for the physiologic changes during pregnancy (e.g., transformation of the endometrium, prevention of menstruation, proliferation of mammary glands), and serum levels constantly increase throughout pregnancy (graphs D and E). When hCG levels peak and decline, placental tissue accounts for the production of progesterone and estrogen, and the corpus luteum degenerates.","bool":true},{"option":"D","explanation":"Graph D represents the changes in the levels of estrogen seen during menstruation followed by successful fertilization and pregnancy.

Increased urinary frequency occurs due to increased renal perfusion and increased intraabdominal pressure, which results in increased urinary bladder pressure. The increase in renal perfusion leads to an elevated glomerular filtration rate, which explains the low serum creatinine levels seen here. During pregnancy, a borderline low hemoglobin concentration (i.e., one that rarely drops below 11 g/dL) is a common finding that reflects an increase in plasma volume and resultant dilutional anemia. A pH of 7.44, a low pCO2 of 31 mm Hg, and a bicarbonate concentration of 21 mEq/L indicate chronic compensated respiratory alkalosis. During pregnancy, progesterone indirectly increases minute ventilation by increasing the sensitivity of the respiratory center to carbon dioxide. This physiologic response results in a slightly higher pO2 and a slightly lower pCO2 to facilitate gaseous exchange between maternal blood and the fetoplacental unit. An additional effect of hyperventilation is chronic respiratory alkalosis, which is compensated by renal acidification.","bool":true},{"option":"Serum iron studies","explanation":"\nSerum iron studies can be warranted in patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, which typically manifests with fatigue and a low hemoglobin concentration. However, during pregnancy, hemoglobin concentration decreases by about 2 g/dL from the prepregnancy value due to a ∼ 40–50% increase in plasma volume.

Fetal malpresentation (e.g., breech presentation) is another important risk factor for umbilical cord prolapse. In breech presentation, an unengaged fetal head creates enough space for the umbilical cord to prolapse through the cervical opening past the fetal presenting part. Umbilical cord prolapse (and subsequent compression) manifests with an abrupt change from a previously normal CTG to one with fetal bradycardia or recurrent, severe decelerations. Management of umbilical cord prolapse includes placing the mother in Trendelenburg position and intrauterine resuscitation along with the administration of a tocolytic (e.g., fenoterol) followed by emergency cesarean delivery.\nBefore labor, patients with breech presentation are generally managed with external cephalic version followed by planned cesarean delivery if this procedure is unsuccessful.

Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are formed early in life, without prior sensitization (unlike anti-Rh antibodies, which require prior exposure to Rh-positive blood). While most of these antibodies are IgM antibodies that cannot pass the placenta, some are IgG antibodies that can enter into fetal circulation during pregnancy and may result in hemolysis when the infant has A or B antigens, as seen here. Only 5–10% of newborns with ABO incompatibility show symptoms. Clinical presentation is typically mild, with hyperbilirubinemia developing within the first 24 hours after birth.

Diagnosis is confirmed by transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasonography, which shows fetal vessels overlying the internal os and decreased blood flow within fetal vessels. An emergency cesarean delivery should be performed if fetal distress is present.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Ruptured uterus","explanation":"A prior cesarean section is a risk factor for uterine rupture. A ruptured uterus would result in fetal distress, but the mother would have severe abdominal pain and be in shock.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Placenta previa","explanation":"Both multiparity and a prior cesarean section are risk factors for placenta previa, which can cause painless, third-trimester vaginal bleeding. However, placenta previa is associated with maternal blood loss, which may lead to maternal tachycardia and hypotension.

Placenta accreta, however, would result in postpartum hemorrhage, not antepartum hemorrhage.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Latent phase of labor","explanation":"The latent phase of labor is the initial part of the first stage of labor. The first stage of labor begins with the onset of uterine contractions. This patient does not have uterine contractions and is therefore not in labor.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Threatened abortion","explanation":"A threatened abortion would present with vaginal bleeding during pregnancy.

A thorough maternal and fetal evaluation is important for determining the cause of intrauterine fetal demise.","answers":[{"option":"Recommend fetal autopsy ","explanation":"\nFetal autopsy is recommended for all patients who have experienced a stillbirth to investigate the underlying cause of fetal death, assess the risk for future pregnancies, and potentially prevent recurrence. Additional components of the evaluation should include fetal karyotyping, gross and microscopic examination of the placenta and umbilical cord, microbiologic studies, and clinical and laboratory evaluation of the mother. Common causes of intrauterine fetal demise include congenital malformations (e.g., neural tube defects, heart defects), intrauterine growth restriction (most commonly due to placental insufficiency), and congenital infections (e.g., parvovirus, cytomegalovirus, Treponema pallidum).\nThe etiology of a significant proportion of stillbirths remains unknown even after a thorough evaluation.","bool":true},{"option":"Reassure parents of low risk of recurrent stillbirth","explanation":"Since the cause of the intrauterine fetal demise is unknown in this patient, the risk of future stillbirth is also unknown.

BH4 is a cofactor for two enzymes of phenylalanine metabolism: phenylalanine hydroxylase, which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine; and tyrosine hydroxylase, which converts tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). DOPA is a precursor for the synthesis of melanin, and catecholamines (e.g., dopamine). Since dopamine inhibits prolactin synthesis in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, patients with BH4 deficiency can develop hyperprolactinemia. Whereas classic PKU (phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency) can be treated with dietary phenylalanine restriction and tyrosine supplementation only, additional supplementation of BH4 is needed in malignant PKU.\nPatients with malignant PKU can also develop serotonin deficiency since BH4 is also required for the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin.","bool":true},{"option":"Tyrosine","explanation":"\nTyrosine supplementation along with dietary phenylalanine restriction is required in all forms of PKU.

As a result, the MSAFP value was compared to the standardized mean for a 17-week-old fetus when, in actuality, the fetus was further along in development. Because AFP is synthesized by the fetal yolk sac, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, its concentration increases throughout pregnancy as the fetus grows.

Cervical reinforcement as a result of cerclage placement helps prevent potential pregnancy loss and preterm birth. In patients who have contraindications for the procedure (e.g., chorioamnionitis, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, high risk of miscarriage) or insufficient indications (e.g., short cervix but no history of preterm birth), vaginal progesterone supplementation can be considered. Progesterone seems to decrease the risk of preterm birth, neonatal morbidity, and mortality in patients with cervical insufficiency.

Risk factors for this condition include fetal macrosomia, maternal obesity, and maternal diabetes mellitus, all of which are present here. However, most cases of shoulder dystocia occur in the absence of identifiable risk factors and are therefore difficult to prevent. Shoulder dystocia puts the newborn at risk of clavicle or humerus fractures, transient or permanent brachial plexus injuries such as Erb palsy (or, less frequently, Klumpke palsy), and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to umbilical cord compression. Hemorrhage due to uterine atony/rupture and perineal lacerations are the most common maternal complications associated with shoulder dystocia.

The diagnosis is supported by findings of amniotic fluid leaking from the cervix and pooling in the vaginal vault and is further confirmed by a positive nitrazine test, fern test, or rapid detection test for insulin-like growth factor 1 or placental alpha microglobulin-1. Patients with PPROM should be monitored for potential changes in amniotic fluid volumes or fetal heart rate, and for signs of intraamniotic infection. In stable patients at ≥ 34 weeks' gestation, both expectant management and induction of labor can be considered. If patients are managed expectantly, a single course of antenatal corticosteroids should be administered.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not generally recommend antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with PPROM at ≥ 34 weeks' gestation.

Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago. Physical examination shows bilateral breast tenderness. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. Which of the following is the most accurate predictor of gestational age?","difficulty":3,"hint":"There are several methods of determining the gestational age and estimated date of delivery (EDD). However, one of these methods is especially accurate during the first trimester.","answers":[{"option":"Crown-rump length","explanation":"\nUltrasonographic measurement of crown-rump length (CRL) is the single most accurate method of estimating the gestational age in the first trimester (error ± 5–7 days). In gestations &lt; 9 weeks, if the EDD derived from CRL differs from that calculated by the last menstrual period by more than 5 days, the EDD should be changed to correspond to the value obtained by CRL measurement. This step is important because a wrong gestational age/EDD can influence pregnancy outcomes at the end of gestation (e.g., increased incidence of induction of labor by misclassifying the pregnancy as post term).\nAfter 14 weeks of gestation (CRL &gt; 84 mm), the accuracy of CRL in predicting gestational age decreases because of progressive curvature in the longitudinal axis of the fetus. At this stage, other measures such as biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femoral length are used to estimate the gestational age if dating was not done during the first trimester. The accuracy of these measures at estimating the gestational age is, however, lower (error of ± 1–2 weeks) when compared to CRL. Beyond 20 weeks, however, the margin of error is large with all biometric parameters (± 3 weeks).","bool":true},{"option":"Mean sac diameter","explanation":"The mean diameter of the gestational sac (mean sac diameter) can give a rough estimate of the gestational age, but the margin of error by this measurement is larger than that calculated by a different biometric parameter on ultrasonography; the use of mean sac diameter to date pregnancy is therefore not recommended.\nDuring early pregnancy (3–5 weeks), the gestational sac is visible but the embryo may not be seen; in such a scenario the mean sac diameter may be recorded to document pregnancy.","bool":false},{"option":"Femoral length","explanation":"The fetal femoral length cannot be used to estimate the fetal gestational age during the first trimester because femoral development only begins by 9 weeks and is usually not completed before 11 weeks.

The fetal femoral length can be used to estimate gestational age after 14 weeks.","bool":false},{"option":"Ratio of head to abdominal circumference","explanation":"The ratio of head to abdominal circumference is used to differentiate asymmetrical from symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation (the ratio is increased in asymmetrical intrauterine growth retardation) but is not used to assess gestational age.","bool":false},{"option":"Biparietal length","explanation":"The fetal biparietal diameter gives the best estimate of gestational age between 14 and 20 weeks, but is unreliable before this period.","bool":false},{"option":"Last menstrual period","explanation":"The first day of the last menstrual period can be used to estimate the gestational age and/or EDD. But such an estimate of gestational age is error-prone because it assumes that all menstrual cycles last 28 days and that ovulation always occurs in the middle of the cycle (at 14 days). Also, many patients do not recall the exact date of their last menstrual period, and some patients may report the mild vaginal spotting that may occur as a result of implantation bleeding as their period.","bool":false},{"option":"Serum β-hCG levels","explanation":"During early pregnancy, the levels of serum β-hCG double every 2.5 days, reaching a maximum level between 100,000 and 200,000 mIU/mL ∼ 60–70 days after implantation. Subsequently, the levels of β-hCG decrease to 10,000–20,000 IU/mL by the middle of the second trimester and remain constant thereafter. Moreover, spontaneous abortion can cause a lower-than-expected level of β-hCG while twin pregnancies, gestational trophoblastic disease, and fetal trisomy can cause a higher-than-expected level. Given this overall variability in the levels of β-hCG levels during pregnancy, it cannot be used to accurately estimate the gestational age.","bool":false},{"option":"Symphisiofundal height","explanation":"The symphisiofundal height (SFH) in a normal pregnancy does correlate with the duration of gestation. However, other factors such as the position of the umbilicus, the amount of fat in the abdominal wall, patient height, the fullness of the rectum or bladder, and deviations from normal pregnancy (e.g., poly-/oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, macrosomia, twin gestation) can affect SFH; SFH is therefore not a very accurate estimator of gestational age.

This causes the release of vasoactive substances by the placenta into the maternal bloodstream that alter systemic endothelial cell function. Increased vascular tone (systemic vasoconstriction) raises maternal blood pressure to ensure sufficient blood supply to the fetus, and endothelial lesions and release of procoagulants result in microthrombi. These factors lead to organ ischemia and damage, which can manifest with headaches and visual disturbances as seen in this patient due to vasospasms in the CNS.\nOther features of preeclampsia include edema and proteinuria (from glomerular endothelial dysfunction and hypertension-induced vasoconstriction), pulmonary edema (from increased capillary permeability), thrombocytopenia (from platelet consumption), and anemia (from microangiopathic hemolysis).

Low‑grade fever, shivering, and leukocytosis may be present during the first 24 hours postpartum and most likely result from the stress of delivery and do not necessarily indicate infection. Cramping (afterpains) is a normal sign of uterus involution (which is caused by oxytocin release, especially during breastfeeding). Red lochia results from shedding of blood and decidua following birth and manifests during the first 4 days after birth with bloody, mucous vaginal discharge (lochia rubra). The discharge then changes in color and texture from red mucous to brown serous (lochia serosa) to yellow-white serous (lochia alba) and lasts for approximately five weeks.\nIf this patient's low-grade fever continues for another day or increases, possible postpartum complications should be investigated.

They are caused by abnormal budding of the foregut and subsequent dilation of the terminal or large bronchi. On chest x-ray, they appear as discrete, round, and sharply defined fluid-filled densities within the middle mediastinum or the pulmonary parenchyma. Bronchogenic cysts are often asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally in adults, but can drain poorly, which causes airway compression with significant respiratory distress, as seen in this patient.

The thenar muscles (opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis) are innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve; compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel can therefore cause thenar atrophy. Branches of the median nerve also provide sensory innervation to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and lateral (radial) half of the ring finger, which is why CTS causes pain and paresthesias in this distribution.\nOther conditions associated with CTS include hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and acromegaly.","bool":true},{"option":"Wrist drop","explanation":"\nWrist drop occurs as a result of injury to the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN), a branch of the radial nerve.

Patients with AP can, therefore, have a positive urine pregnancy test initially and even develop features of pregnancy (e.g., areolar hyperpigmentation), but the expulsion of products of conception (POC) will eventually occur. AP is typically caused by chromosomal defects and is a common cause of early pregnancy loss, which would result in falling β-hCG levels. Vaginal bleeding and loss of pregnancy symptoms are possible manifestations. AP is diagnosed when there is no fetal pole in a true gestational sac ≥ 25 mm in size. Depending on patient preference, AP can be managed expectantly, with misoprostol (to facilitate POC expulsion), or with vacuum evacuation.\nThe double decidual sac sign and intradecidual sign have a high positive predictive value for a true gestational sac.

In gastroschisis, the absence of a hernia sac results in an edematous, erythematous, and dull intestinal wall. This condition is mainly seen in premature infants and those with intrauterine growth restriction, and can be associated with cryptorchidism, gastrointestinal stenoses, and atresia, the latter of which can result in short bowel syndrome.

ABO incompatibility most commonly occurs in neonates with blood groups A or B born to mothers with blood group O. Mothers with blood group O often have anti-B and anti-A antibodies even if no prior sensitization has occurred. While most of these antibodies are of the IgM isotype, which cannot pass the placenta, some are IgG antibodies, which can enter into fetal circulation during pregnancy. Since fetal RBCs do not fully express antigens A and B, these IgG antibodies only cause mild hemolysis and the direct Coombs test is usually negative or only weakly positive.

Patients with HDFN due to ABO incompatibility do not develop hydrops fetalis or kernicterus.\nSee “ABO vs. Rh incompatibility” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Anti-D antibodies","explanation":"The presence of anti-D antibodies is characteristic of Rh incompatibility, which manifests with hemolytic anemia and jaundice in neonates. Rh incompatibility occurs in Rh-negative mothers who have developed anti-Rh antibodies from exposure to Rh-positive blood (e.g., during a prior pregnancy). Although the mother has developed anti-D antibodies due to previous exposure to Rh-positive RBCs (as is evident from her positive anti-Rh antibody titer), her son is Rh-negative and is therefore not at risk for Rh incompatibility.","bool":false},{"option":"RBC enzyme deficiency","explanation":"A deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in red blood cells can cause hemolytic anemia and jaundice in affected neonates.

The lack of routine prenatal care puts this neonate at risk for congenital viral infections but this neonate has no other evidence of these infections (e.g., low birth weight, rash, hepatosplenomegaly). Patients with congenital parvovirus B19 infection can develop anemia as a result of red cell aplasia but these patients present with reticulocytopenia and no evidence of hemolysis.

Blood-tinged, mucoid vaginal discharge, breast bud development, and labial swelling are all effects of intrauterine estrogen exposure. Withdrawal bleeding occurs 1–2 weeks after delivery and is self-limiting. Labial swelling also recedes after a few days. Breast bud development (and even some milky discharge) is physiological in infants of either sex. The patches on this patient's back are congenital dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian spots), which typically resolve within a few years. Because congenital dermal melanocytosis may resemble hematomas, they are often mistaken for signs of child abuse.","bool":true},{"option":"Contact Child Protective Services","explanation":"Contacting child protective services is mandatory if abuse of any kind is suspected. Sexually abused children typically present with injuries in the genital, anal, and oral areas, recurrent urinary tract infections, and sexually transmitted infections that may cause bloody vaginal discharge. The perpetrator is most commonly a male that is familiar with the child (e.g., father, uncle, neighbor). Multiple hematomas, multiple fractures at various stages of healing, and injuries that do not correlate with patient history should raise suspicion for physical abuse. While symptoms such as red, swollen labia, blood-tinged vaginal discharge, and hematomas should raise suspicions of child abuse, closer examination will reveal that, in this patient, the vaginal discharge is most likely due to a physiological process and the flat gray-blue patches on her back and buttocks are in fact due to a benign skin condition. Another course of action is therefore indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Leuprolide therapy","explanation":"\nGnRH agonists (e.g., leuprolide) would be indicated for precocious puberty with elevated GnRH levels (central precocious puberty), which manifests with significant breast development, menstruation, and/or pubic hair development before the age of 8 in girls. In such cases, leuprolide decreases estrogen levels and suppresses sexual maturation. This patient has only mild breast development and scant vaginal bleeding that is more likely due to exposure to intrauterine maternal estrogen. If breast development or vaginal bleeding were more significant, a hormonal abnormality should be suspected. However, precocious puberty is very rare in infants and more commonly is seen in young children. Moreover, the use of leuprolide in children under 2 years is not recommended.","bool":false},{"option":"Ceftriaxone therapy","explanation":"\nCeftriaxone therapy is indicated in cases of gonococcal infection. Patients with congenital gonorrhea typically present with purulent conjunctivitis (gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum) 2–7 days after birth. This condition can lead to visual impairment if left untreated. Less commonly, localized infection of the pharynx, vagina, urethra, and/or anus or disseminated gonococcal infection occur. Although the pregnancy was complicated by maternal gonococcal infection, the infection was treated by antibiotics and should have resolved. Moreover, vaginal discharge in gonorrhea is not odorless and mucoid, but purulent, yellow-green, and malodorous.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Ceftriaxone and doxycycline therapy","explanation":"Combined therapy with ceftriaxone and doxycycline is indicated in patients with gonorrhea in whom coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis has not been ruled out and for patients with coinfection. Patients with congenital gonorrhea and/or chlamydia typically present with eye discharge and conjunctivitis that can lead to visual impairment if left untreated. Although the pregnancy was complicated by maternal gonococcal infection, antibiotic treatment likely resolved the infection. Moreover, vaginal discharge in gonorrhea is purulent rather than mucoid. Finally, doxycycline should be avoided in children aged &lt; 8 years because it forms complexes with calcium ions, thereby causing tooth discoloration and inhibited bone growth. Chlamydial infection in newborns is treated with oral erythromycin instead.","bool":false},{"option":"Order coagulation studies","explanation":"\nCoagulation studies are indicated in suspected hemorrhagic diathesis, which may manifest with significant bruising and bleeding as seen in von Willebrand disease, hemophilia, or other coagulation factor deficiencies (e.g., factors II, VII, IX, and X due to vitamin K deficiency). The large, flat, gray-blue spots on the patient's back and buttocks are benign melanocytic changes, which are easily mistaken for hematomas. The infant's vaginal discharge only contains small amounts of blood, which makes hemorrhagic diathesis unlikely. Moreover, the patient lacks a family history of bleeding disorders.","bool":false},{"option":"MRI of the brain","explanation":"An MRI of the brain is indicated in suspected central precocious puberty, which would manifest with breast development before the age of 8 in girls, pubertal LH levels, and possibly visual disturbances and signs of increased intracranial pressure due to a sellar tumor compressing the optic pathways. Brain lesions that involve the hypothalamus/pituitary region (e.g., sellar and/or suprasellar tumors) may result in premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and thus cause central precocious puberty. The development of sexual characteristics before one year of age is very rare. While this patient's mild breast bud development, swollen labia, and blood-tinged vaginal discharge are hormonally-mediated, they are much less severe than would be expected in precocious puberty.","bool":false},{"option":"Fluconazole therapy","explanation":"\nFluconazole therapy is indicated in suspected neonatal vaginal yeast infection, which is usually vertically transmitted. Patients with yeast infection typically present with odorless, white, crumbly, and sticky vaginal discharge, strong pruritus, and an erythematous vulva and vagina.

OASI occurs as a result of perineal lacerations that involve the anal sphincter complex (i.e., third and fourth-degree lacerations), leading to a decreased anal sphincter tone. Risk factors for this condition include prolonged labor, operative vaginal delivery, fetal macrosomia, and episiotomy. Most individuals with OASI develop symptoms of anal insufficiency (e.g., fecal incontinence) weeks after delivery. Anal sphincter injuries that are not immediately apparent after delivery are unable to receive adequate repair. In these women, symptoms may only first manifest several years after delivery (delayed OASI) when the supporting pelvic floor starts to weaken. The absence of perianal folds in the perianal region (dovetail sign) is characteristic of delayed OASI. The diagnosis of OASI is typically confirmed by endoanal ultrasound.

Aspirated meconium in the tracheobronchial system leads to airway obstruction, chemical irritation, inflammation, and surfactant inactivation, culminating in alveolar collapse. Alveolar collapse results in areas of atelectasis and consequently a right-to-left pulmonary shunt, leading to areas of ventilation/perfusion mismatch with hypoxia and consequent hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This can, in turn, lead to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The administration of supplemental oxygen counters pulmonary vasoconstriction, helping to prevent or reverse PPHN. The management of severe cases should follow the standard steps of neonatal resuscitation.","bool":true},{"option":"Administration of surfactant via an endotracheal tube","explanation":"\nSurfactant therapy is routinely administered in patients with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), which can manifest with signs of increased breathing effort (e.g., nasal flaring, substernal retractions, tachypnea) and hypoxia immediately after birth. However, chest x-ray findings would show diffuse, fine, reticulogranular opacities and decreased rather than increased lung volumes.

Neonatal tetanus most commonly results from unsterile management of the umbilical stump, which is more likely to occur in resource-limited regions or after home births. The tetanus vaccine is routinely administered in pregnancy, which allows the newborn to acquire passive immunity through maternal antibodies that cross the placenta and be protected until the regular tetanus vaccine (at 2 months of age) is administered. Infants born to nonimmunized patients are especially at high risk of developing neonatal tetanus.\nTetanus may cause respiratory muscle spasms, leading to respiratory failure.

Unlike a complete hydatidiform mole, which causes diffuse trophoblastic proliferation without evidence of fetal parts and extensive hydropic villi formation, a partial hydatidiform mole causes focal trophoblastic proliferation with few hydropic villi and is associated with the presence of fetal parts. In approx. 50% of patients with a complete mole, the uterine size is large for gestational age whereas the uterine size is small or normal for gestational age in patients with a partial mole. In a normal gestation, β-hCG concentration doubles every 2.5 days during the first 4 weeks and peaks at 8–10 weeks with a value of approx. 100,000 mlU/mL. In a complete mole, β-hCG concentration is typically much greater than the value expected for gestational age; in a partial mole, β-hCG concentration is similar to the value expected with normal gestation or only slightly more elevated.\nWhen compared to complete moles, partial moles have a lower risk of malignant transformation to gestational trophoblastic neoplasia as well as a lower risk of medical complications (e.g., hyperemesis gravidarum, early-onset preeclampsia, acute respiratory distress syndrome). To prevent malignant transformation, management for all hydatidiform moles consists of a dilation and curettage to remove the trophoblastic tissue and serial β-hCG monitoring to ensure complete removal.

Congenital rubella infection, whose clinical features include sensorineural hearing loss, cataracts, and patent ductus arteriosus, is transmitted vertically from mother to fetus. Rubella is also one of the TORCH infections, which can cause spontaneous abortions, premature birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Screening prior to conception should also include measles, mumps, and varicella antibody titers because vaccination to obtain immunity requires live-attenuated vaccines. Live-attenuated vaccines are contraindicated in pregnancy. To prevent vertical transmission, conception should be avoided for at least 3 months after immunization for these viruses.","bool":true},{"option":"Screen for chlamydia infection","explanation":"\nScreening for chlamydia infection is recommended in all sexually active women &lt; 25 years of age and all women who are at increased risk for a sexually transmitted infection (e.g., having more than one sex partner, using condoms inconsistently outside a mutually monogamous relationship, performing sex in exchange for money).

This condition is caused by several components of bilirubin metabolism in newborns, including immaturity of the pathways for hepatic conjugation and elimination (due to decreased activity of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase), the short life span of erythrocytes in newborns, and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin (due to low bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and certain breast milk components). Exclusively breastfed newborns are more likely to develop physiological neonatal jaundice. Treatment of neonatal jaundice by phototherapy is indicated if bilirubin levels increase above a defined threshold.","bool":true},{"option":"Breastfeeding jaundice","explanation":"\nBreastfeeding jaundice is caused by insufficient breast milk intake and manifests with indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the first week of life. However, newborns with breastfeeding jaundice usually also show features of dehydration (e.g., few wet diapers, decreased skin turgor), irritability, and weight loss.

Furthermore, neither of these infections are known to cause arthritis in adults.","bool":false},{"option":"Sensorineural deafness","explanation":"\nSensorineural hearing loss in a fetus may be due to an infection with rubella virus, Treponema pallidum, or cytomegalovirus (CMV). While both rubella and T. pallidum (secondary syphilis) may cause arthritis in adult patients, rubella is an enveloped ssRNA virus, T. pallidum is a bacteria, and CMV is a dsDNA virus. Therefore, none of these infections fit the nonenveloped ssDNA virus profile identified by the investigator.","bool":false},{"option":"Microcephaly","explanation":"\nMicrocephaly in a fetus may be due to an infection with Zika virus (a Flavivirus). This intrauterine infection may also present with mild fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. Although Zika virus can cause arthralgias in adults, it is an enveloped ssRNA virus, unlike the nonenveloped ssDNA virus identified by the investigator.","bool":false},{"option":"Notched teeth","explanation":"Notched, widely spaced teeth in a young child is a highly suggestive finding of a congenital infection with Treponema pallidum (a Spirochete). This infection may also present with sensorineural deafness, facial abnormalities (saddle nose, short maxilla), saber shins, and hydrops fetalis. T. pallidum is a bacterium, not a virus.","bool":false},{"option":"Vesicular rash","explanation":"A vesicular rash in a fetus is highly suggestive of an intrauterine or perinatal infection with herpes simplex virus (typically HSV-2). This infection can lead to a variety of clinical features including fetal demise, microcephaly, and meningoencephalitis. The HSV-2 virus is an enveloped dsDNA virus, unlike the nonenveloped ssDNA virus identified by the investigator.","bool":false}]},{"id":232,"info":"Pregnancy, Childbirth and Puerperium","question":"A 2-day-old male newborn is evaluated in the neonatal intensive care unit because of irritability and feeding difficulty. He was born at 35 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman following an uncomplicated delivery. He is awake and alert. He is at the 4th percentile for length and weight. Temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 160/min, respirations are 55/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Cardiac examination discloses a 3/6 continuous murmur best heard in the left infraclavicular region. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Laboratory studies show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows blood flow between the pulmonary artery and descending aorta. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Features of heart failure (e.g., irritability, poor feeding, failure to thrive) with a continuous murmur at the left infraclavicular region are highly suggestive of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), for which premature birth is a risk factor. The echocardiography findings confirm the diagnosis.","answers":[{"option":"Ibuprofen","explanation":"\nNon-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as ibuprofen and indomethacin are the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic PDA in premature infants. Prostaglandins keep the ductus arteriosus patent. By inhibiting cyclooxygenase, NSAIDs decrease prostaglandin production and thus promote ductal closure. NSAIDs are only effective in preterm infants and when administered within 10–14 days of birth. Procedural closure (e.g., percutaneous transcatheter closure, thoracotomy and surgical ligation) is generally reserved for preterm infants who fail to respond to pharmacotherapy and for full-term infants &gt; 5 kg.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Prostaglandin E1","explanation":"\nProstaglandin E1 (PGE1) is indicated in patients with ductal-dependent congenital heart diseases (CHDs) in order to maintain ductus arteriosus patency before surgery can be performed. However, ductal-dependent CHDs typically manifest at birth with pronounced cyanosis. This patient's murmur and normal pulse oximetry reading are suggestive of an isolated PDA, which means that prostaglandins are contraindicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Hydrochlorothiazide","explanation":"\nHydrochlorothiazide can be used in preterm infants with a large PDA for symptomatic management. Although it can provide symptomatic relief, it would not address the underlying cause of heart failure in this patient (PDA).","bool":false},{"option":"Furosemide","explanation":"\nFurosemide is the preferred treatment for the management of heart failure in full-term infants with PDA who weigh &lt; 5 kg. However, it would not address the underlying cause of heart failure in this patient (PDA). In addition, this infant is preterm and thus requires a different therapeutic approach.","bool":false},{"option":"Digoxin","explanation":"\nDigoxin can be used for symptomatic management of heart failure in full-term infants with a large PDA who weigh &lt; 5 kg. However, it would not correct the underlying cause of this patient's heart failure (PDA). In addition, this infant is preterm, and thus requires a different therapeutic approach.","bool":false}]},{"id":233,"info":"Pregnancy, Childbirth and Puerperium","question":"A 36-year-old primigravid woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild suprapubic pain 1 hour ago. The bleeding has subsided and she has mild, brown spotting now. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years and drank alcohol occasionally but stopped both 6 weeks ago. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 116/77 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a closed cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 8-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an intrauterine pregnancy and normal fetal cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":1,"hint":"Vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain before the 20th week of gestation with a closed cervical os and ultrasonography showing a viable fetus are diagnostic of threatened abortion.","answers":[{"option":"Reassurance and follow-up ultrasonography","explanation":"Patients with a threatened abortion should receive expectant management with weekly follow-up ultrasounds until their symptoms resolve. Additionally, patients should abstain from strenuous exercise and sexual intercourse during this time. Rh(D)-negative women should receive Rh(D)-immune globulin. Some cases of threatened abortion progress to inevitable, incomplete, or complete abortion. Patients should therefore be advised to present immediately if the vaginal bleeding and pain increases or if they pass products of conception.","bool":true},{"option":"Complete bed rest","explanation":"Complete bed rest used to be part of the routine management of patients with threatened abortion and is still often advised by physicians. However, since studies have found no significant benefit in preventing fetal loss in patients that were prescribed bed rest, guidelines no longer recommend this.","bool":false},{"option":"Misoprostol therapy","explanation":"In patients with incomplete, inevitable, or missed abortion, misoprostol can be used to support expulsion of products of conception. Although all types of spontaneous abortion can manifest with mild vaginal bleeding, patients with an incomplete abortion or an inevitable abortion typically have an open cervical os. However, fetal cardiac activity is apparent on ultrasound in neither incomplete nor missed abortions.","bool":false},{"option":"Dilation and curettage","explanation":"In patients with inevitable, missed, or incomplete abortion, dilation and curettage can be used to evacuate products of conception from the uterus. Although all types of spontaneous abortion can manifest with mild vaginal bleeding, patients with an incomplete abortion or an inevitable abortion typically have an open cervical os. However, fetal cardiac activity is apparent on ultrasound in neither incomplete nor missed abortions.","bool":false},{"option":"Progestin therapy","explanation":"Treatment of threatened abortion with progestin has shown promising results in several small studies. However, there is still insufficient data on the use of progestin to definitively establish the efficacy in threatened abortion. Therefore, it is currently not recommended as part of the routine treatment.","bool":false},{"option":"Low-dose aspirin therapy","explanation":"\nLow-dose aspirin therapy has been shown to be beneficial in the prevention of early pregnancy loss in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This patient, however, has neither a history nor any signs suggestive of APS such as recurrent miscarriages, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or splinter hemorrhages. If the patient experiences recurrent miscarriages in the future, she should be tested for APS.","bool":false},{"option":"Cervical cerclage","explanation":"A cervical cerclage can be considered in patients with cervical insufficiency to reduce the risk of pregnancy loss. Symptoms of cervical insufficiency do usually not become apparent until later on in the pregnancy but would typically show a soft or dilated cervix, unlike in this patient. Additionally, a cervical cerclage is usually not placed before 12 weeks' gestation.","bool":false}]},{"id":234,"info":"Pregnancy, Childbirth and Puerperium","question":"A 21-year-old woman comes to the physician because she had a positive pregnancy test at home.

She runs 45 minutes daily and lifts weights for strength training for 1 hour three times per week. She also reports that she wants to renew her ski pass for the upcoming winter season. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. After having ascertained that the patient wants to keep the pregnancy, which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Regular physical activity is recommended during pregnancy. However, there are certain unsafe activities that pregnant individuals should avoid.","answers":[{"option":"Stop playing soccer, continue strength training, and do not buy a ski pass","explanation":"While physical activity is beneficial for most pregnant individuals, contact sports (e.g., soccer), sports with increased risk of falling (e.g., skiing), activities associated with high risk of dehydration (e.g., hot yoga), and extreme sports (e.g., skydiving) should be avoided. Activities such as running, strength training (in patients with training experience before pregnancy), racquet sports, swimming, and pilates are considered safe during uncomplicated pregnancies (see “Safe and unsafe sports during pregnancy” table).\nSome preexisting or obstetric medical conditions, such as hemodynamically significant heart disease, restrictive lung disease, severe anemia, and cervical insufficiency, constitute absolute contradictions to exercise during pregnancy.
