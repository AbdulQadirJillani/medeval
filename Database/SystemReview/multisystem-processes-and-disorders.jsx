He was born at term and exclusively breastfed until 15 months of age. His mother says he has been well, apart from an episode of high fever and seizure 4 months ago for which she did not seek medical attention. He has an older brother who is currently receiving medical treatment for failure to thrive. His parents have no history of serious illness; they are of normal height. His last vaccine was at the age of 4 months. He has never received any supplements or medications. He is at the 20th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 50th percentile for head circumference. Physical examination shows dry mucous membranes, erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors, and carious molars. He has frontal bossing. His wrists are widened, and his legs seem bent. Palpation of the chest shows nodular deformities at the costochondral junctions. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's delay in walking?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Frontal bossing, beading of the ribs, widened wrists, bowing of the legs, and erosion of tooth enamel suggest vitamin D deficiency. As this patient has been exclusively breastfed without supplementation until recently, vitamin D deficiency is likely a result of low oral intake, because breast milk only has low amounts of vitamin D.","answers":[{"option":"Deficiency of cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase","explanation":"The cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase is ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy, which classically manifests with weakness and fatigue (early), followed by mucosal bleeding, curly hair, poor wound healing, and increased susceptibility to severe infection (late). This patient's presentation is inconsistent with scurvy.","bool":false},{"option":"Defect in type I collagen","explanation":"\nType I collagen defects cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which manifests with very fragile bones that are prone to fracture from minimal trauma. Other classic findings include blue sclerae, poor hearing, and dental abnormalities. While this patient has skeletal abnormalities, he has no history of recurrent fractures or blue sclerae. Moreover, OI does not cause joint abnormalities.","bool":false},{"option":"Mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3","explanation":"Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene cause achondroplasia, which manifests with short stature and frontal prominence. However, height is usually below the 5th percentile in achondroplasia. Moreover, this condition is not associated with dental changes or beading of the ribs. Instead, skeletal abnormalities such as microcephaly, short extremities, and scoliosis are typically seen in achondroplasia.","bool":false},{"option":"Defective growth plate mineralization","explanation":"\nDefective growth plate mineralization due to vitamin D deficiency is the cause of rickets. The impaired bone mineralization leads to bead-like costochondral junctions (“rachitic rosary”), erosion of tooth enamel, bone pain and weakening (frontal bossing), abnormal bowing (genu varum), and distention of the bone (widened joints). These bone deformities are responsible for the delay in this patient's walking. Dietary changes (increased vitamin D, calcium, and phosphate intake) and adequate sun exposure are the first-line treatments for rickets.\nThis patient's malnutrition seems to arise from domestic neglect as suggested by the elder sibling's failure to thrive, the lack of medical attention after a seizure, the lack of vaccinations, and improper feeding practices (i.e., late introduction of solid foods, lack of vitamin D supplementation during first year of life).","bool":true},{"option":"Multiple bone fractures in different stages of healing","explanation":"Multiple fractures at different stages of healing should raise concern for child abuse. In preambulatory children, specific fractures (e.g., of the ribs, scapula, hands/fingers, and spiral fractures of the femur), are especially concerning. Although this patient has various joint, craniofacial, chest wall, and dental anomalies, his presentation is more concerning for neglect (as suggested by dry mucous membranes, lack of vaccinations, late weaning) rather than child abuse.","bool":false},{"option":"Deficiency of osteoclasts to reabsorb bone","explanation":"Deficient osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is the pathophysiologic mechanism of osteopetrosis. This condition is extremely rare in the pediatric population. Most often, these patients present with cranial nerve palsies (from cranial foramen narrowing), hip abnormalities, and an increased tendency for long bone fractures. This patient does exhibit long bone and joint abnormalities, but he lacks fractures or cranial nerve palsies.

His history of prolonged immobilization from his recent accident, decreased parathyroid hormone (PTH), and increased urinary calcium excretion suggest his hypercalcemia is due to increased bone resorption.","answers":[{"option":"Bisphosphonates","explanation":"\nIntravenous bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid, pamidronate) are the first-line treatment for symptomatic hypercalcemia due to excessive bone resorption from any cause (e.g., prolonged immobilization). This class of drugs inhibits osteoclast activity, which decreases bone breakdown and calcium release. Dosage adjustment and close monitoring of renal function are recommended during bisphosphonate therapy in patients with renal impairment, as bisphosphonates are potentially nephrotoxic. In addition, calcitonin should be administered in patients with moderate or severe symptomatic hypercalcemia to increase urinary calcium excretion. Patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia are usually also dehydrated and require intravenous normal saline to lower blood calcium levels and achieve adequate urine output and blood pressure.\nMost patients with intact renal function and no other preexisting condition for high bone turnover (e.g., Paget disease of bone, malignancy) are able to compensate for increased bone resorption through increased urinary calcium excretion (i.e., hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia).

Since splenic rupture is most likely to occur 2–21 days after symptom onset, patients should avoid physical activity for at least 21 days after initial symptoms develop and avoid contact sports (e.g., football, wrestling) for at least 4 weeks. If patients have signs of potential splenic rupture (e.g., left upper quadrant pain, Kehr sign), imaging with ultrasound or CT is indicated. The management of IM-associated splenic rupture is the same as that for traumatic splenic rupture and depends on the extent of the injury: Hemodynamically stable patients with low-grade splenic lesions can often be treated conservatively (observation and symptomatic treatment) whereas hemodynamically unstable patients or those with high-grade splenic lesions require surgery.","bool":true},{"option":"Burkitt lymphoma","explanation":"\nBurkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that can develop following EBV infection.

The deleterious effects of methanol result from its conversion by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase into the toxic metabolite formaldehyde, which is converted to formic acid. Formic acid causes metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap and elevated osmolar gap, retinal toxicity, and coma. Fomepizole, which inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, delays the production of these toxic metabolites until methanol can be eliminated by the kidney. Hemodialysis is also required to increase the rate of elimination of methanol in patients with renal failure, and those with severe cases of methanol poisoning (e.g., patients with loss of vision, persistent anion gap metabolic acidosis). In addition to fomepizole and hemodialysis, the patients should receive cofactor therapy with folinic acid to facilitate the elimination of methanol and its metabolites via nontoxic metabolic pathways.\nThe emergency management of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning also involves securing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation, and administering sodium bicarbonate.

It functions as an inhibitor of δ-aminolevulinate synthase which, in turn, leads to decreased heme synthesis and decreased production of intermediates that are thought to cause symptoms in AIP. The frequency of acute AIP exacerbations or “attacks” is highly variable. They are often precipitated by exposure to certain exacerbating factors, such as alcohol (as with this patient), smoking, fasting, stress, and certain medications. These factors are thought to induce heme synthesis (directly or indirectly), increasing the amount of toxic intermediates in affected individuals.\nGlucose can also be used as a temporizing measure in patients with attacks of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), as seen in this patient. Glucose nonspecifically downregulates hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in heme production, and subsequently decreases the buildup of the toxic intermediates that produce symptoms of AIP.

Most patients outgrow this benign condition between 4 and 8 years of age; usually, reassurance and follow-up are sufficient and no further treatment is required. The typical sequence includes crying, exhalation, and breath-holding, followed by cyanosis and loss of consciousness. Patients usually resume breathing and regain consciousness in less than 1 minute. Diagnosis is typically based on the clinical features and a detailed description of the episode. Parents should be made aware of the triggers of breath-holding spells, such as tantrums, minor injuries, and distress. However, no special precautions must be taken to avoid these triggers. Because several studies suggest an association between breath-holding spells and iron-deficiency anemia, confirmatory tests (e.g., CBC, serum ferritin) may be considered.

The preceding cyanosis and the short duration (&lt; 2 minutes) of his jerky movements favor the diagnosis of an anoxic seizure (i.e., secondary to breath-holding) over an epileptic seizure. In addition, this patient has no other symptoms (e.g., neurological deficits) that would be indicative of a structural lesion. More importantly, MRI, not CT scan, is the modality of choice in children. MRI has a higher sensitivity and does not carry the risk of exposure to radiation.","bool":false},{"option":"Tilt table test","explanation":"The tilt table test is used to diagnose vasovagal or orthostatic syncope. Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope in children and young adults and may be triggered by fear, pain, or emotional stress. The syncope may be accompanied by a convulsive episode with tonic-clonic movements and postictal confusion, in which case it is referred to as convulsive syncope. However, a syncope is typically preceded by autonomic symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, visual impairment, and sweating, which this patient did not have.

Vitamin B12 is a coenzyme for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Thus, if there are insufficient levels of vitamin B12, methylmalonyl-CoA cannot be broken down, leading to an accumulation of MMA and its precursor, propionyl-CoA. These products, along with their associated odd-chain fatty acids, cannot be completely metabolized, which causes neuron damage (due to propionyl-CoA replacing acetyl-CoA in neuronal membranes), demyelination, and consequent neurological manifestations. This patient's vitamin B12 deficiency is likely the result of malabsorption due to partial gastrectomy and the loss of parietal cells that produce intrinsic factor, which is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption in the terminal ileum.\nVitamin B12 deficiency also results in elevated homocysteine levels because vitamin B12 functions as a coenzyme in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthase.

The mutation found on molecular testing confirms the diagnosis.","answers":[{"option":"Medium-chain triglycerides","explanation":"CPT II is a mitochondrial enzyme that removes long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) from carnitine once the LCFAs have entered the mitochondria (the attachment to carnitine is required for entry from the cytosol into the mitochondria). In CPT II deficiency, LCFA cannot be metabolized, which leads to hypoketotic hypoglycemia (due to the reduced substrate available for gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis), myalgia, and weakness. Furthermore, the build-up of LCFA in cells leads to hepatomegaly, liver failure, cardiomyopathy, and rhabdomyolysis. In addition to avoiding intake of LCFA, increased intake of medium-chain fatty acids is recommended, as they do not require carnitine transport and therefore can be metabolized despite the CPT II defect.","bool":true},{"option":"Long-chain fatty acids","explanation":"\nLong-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are transported by the carnitine shuttle into the mitochondrial matrix, where they serve as substrates for β-oxidation.

In addition, the bacteria's ability to spread quickly across host cells via actin rocket tails makes it relatively resistant to the host antibody response. The human immune response to listeriosis relies on the production of lymphokines such as interferon-γ by CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, which activate macrophages and increase the production of reactive oxygen species that are highly toxic to Listeria. Another important mechanism includes the release of perforin and granzymes from CD8+ T cells, which serve to lyse host cells infected with L. monocytogenes, thereby exposing the bacteria to immune cells for destruction and phagocytosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Secretion of immunoglobulin G from plasma cells","explanation":"Secretion of immunoglobulin G from plasma cells is an adaptive immune defense mechanism. Antigens on the surface of extracellular pathogens induce the production of immunoglobulins that are specific to the encountered antigen.

The MAC is not involved in defense against infection with L. monocytogenes.","bool":false},{"option":"Secretion of interferon-α from infected cells","explanation":"Secretion of interferon-α from infected cells is a prominent feature of the innate host response in viral infection. IFN-α acts to induce downregulation of protein synthesis in the infected cell (to disrupt viral replication) and upregulation of MHC expression in uninfected neighboring cells (to stimulate an immune response). L. monocytogenes is also known to induce IFN-α secretion, but rather than support clearance of the infection, it is thought to have negative implications due to its downstream inhibition of cytokine production and pro-inflammatory pathways.","bool":false}]},{"id":33,"info":"Multisystem Processes and Disorders","question":"\nA 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for the evaluation of delay in attaining developmental milestones.

Although patients already have hyperuricemia at birth, they are usually asymptomatic for the first few months of life, except for the orange sand-like sodium urate crystals that are found in the diapers of affected infants. Neurological features, which often appear around 4–6 months of age, include development delay, behavioral symptoms (aggressiveness, self-injurious behavior), and pyramidal (e.g., spasticity) and extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., dystonia). Hypotonia can also occur early in the disease course. These cognitive and neuromuscular deficits lead to difficulties walking and affected children typically require a wheelchair. Accumulation of uric acid in peripheral tissues can eventually result in gouty arthritis, urate nephropathy, and megaloblastic anemia.

The degree of restriction appears to be correlated with the severity of dorsal kyphosis as well as the presence of costovertebral and costosternal ankylosis. Lung compliance and alveolar gas exchange usually remain largely unchanged in extrinsic causes of RLD. In contrast to certain extrinsic causes of RLD (e.g., pleural effusion, obesity), individuals with AS can have a normal functional residual capacity and a normal to increased residual volume because the chest wall is at a higher position at rest due to fixation of the rib cage.

The patient's father would, therefore, have been negative for DMD, and the patient's sister was most likely a carrier because the patient's nephew has DMD.","answers":[{"option":"Gonadal mosaicism","explanation":"Since the X chromosome cannot be inherited paternally in men, there are only 3 possibilities with respect to this patient: the patient's mother was a somatic carrier of DMD, the DMD mutation was acquired by the patient's brother after fertilization (somatic mutation), or the mutation was generated de-novo in at least some of the X chromosome-containing haploid germ cells of the patient's mother (gonadal mosaicism). It is known that the patient's mother is not a somatic carrier of DMD. A post-fertilization mutation affecting the patient's brother is also unlikely because the patient's sister is a carrier; it would be extremely rare for a post-fertilization mutation to affect the same locus of the same gene in 2 members of the same family. Therefore, it must be implied that at least some of the X chromosome-containing haploid germ cells of the patient's mother would have had the DMD mutation. Gonadal mosaicism occurs when some or all of the germline cells (eggs or sperm) are genetically distinct from the rest of the body as a result of de-novo mutations in primordial germ cells during mitosis.

This results in disease penetrance in every individual that carries the mutation. However, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. Individuals heterozygous for the DMD mutation are carriers and not phenotypically afflicted with the disease. Marfan syndrome, which can cause heart failure due to chronic aortic regurgitation or mitral valve prolapse, is associated with a dominant negative mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene.

Moreover, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disease, and so a euploid individual with X-chromosomal maternal uniparental disomy would be female, unlike this male patient.

Instead, a dilated right ventricle with a decreased right ventricular ejection fraction would be more typical for patients with severe PE.\nThe physiological increase in cardiac output during pregnancy and/or maternal comorbidities such as anemia and hyperthyroidism can place the myocardium under hypoxic stress.

Acute pericarditis can manifest with tachycardia, dyspnea, and chest pain that worsens with inspiration. However, other features such as fever and a pericardial friction rub would be present.

The chest pain in acute MI is, however, described as continuous with radiation to the jaw or left arm. An increase in pain with inspiration along with evidence of pleural effusion (decreased breath sounds) indicates a pleuritic cause for chest pain.

Adrenoleukodystrophy can sometimes manifest very similarly to other rare neurological conditions of childhood (e.g., sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses). Often, the main distinguishing factor is the presence of adrenal insufficiency (usually manifesting with hyperpigmented skin but also fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, etc.). Adrenoleukodystrophy is primarily diagnosed via a very long-chain fatty acid panel or mutation analysis.\nTreatment is primarily aimed at addressing adrenal insufficiency, if present, with steroids.

Arthralgias, elevated ESR, leukocytosis with left shift, thrombocytosis, elevated transaminases, and normocytic anemia are commonly seen in patients with this condition.","answers":[{"option":"Coronary artery aneurysm","explanation":"\nCoronary artery aneurysms are the most concerning possible complication of Kawasaki disease, as rupture or thrombosis of the aneurysm can be lethal. The risk of developing coronary aneurysms is 25% in untreated patients and is highest during the second and third weeks following symptom onset. All patients with Kawasaki disease should undergo echocardiography at diagnosis, as well as at 2 weeks and 6–8 weeks after diagnosis to evaluate for coronary artery aneurysms. Treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose oral aspirin reduce the risk of developing coronary artery aneurysms.\nThe use of aspirin is generally contraindicated in children because of its strong association with Reye syndrome, but Kawasaki disease is a rare exception: High-dose aspirin acts as an antiinflammatory agent and is given until the fever has subsided. Treatment is then continued at a lower dose, at which aspirin has an antiplatelet effect until ESR has normalized (1–2 months).","bool":true},{"option":"Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis","explanation":"\nRapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a complication of Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). This condition is more common in children than adults and manifests with arthritis/arthralgia (typically in the knees) and a rash 1–3 weeks following an upper respiratory tract infection. However, HSP most commonly manifests with symmetrically distributed, raised erythematous macules in the lower extremities that coalesce into palpable purpura rather than a polymorphous truncal rash.

In DKA, the accumulation of acidic ketone bodies leads to a marked decrease in pH. Serum bicarbonate (HCO3-) is low because it is consumed as a buffer. Despite actual total body potassium deficits, most patients with DKA present with normal potassium levels due to the shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space. Evacuation of gastric contents, however, removes acid from the body, which in turn leads to metabolic alkalosis.","bool":false},{"option":"B","explanation":"This set of findings is consistent with metabolic alkalosis due to bicarbonate (HCO3-) excess. Etiologies include excessive administration of bicarbonate in a patient with renal impairment, and milk-alkali syndrome, a condition in which ingestion of large amounts of calcium in combination with antacid therapy interferes with renal bicarbonate excretion. Although evacuation of gastric contents typically leads to metabolic alkalosis, further serum electrolyte changes would be expected here.","bool":false},{"option":"C","explanation":"This set of findings is consistent with hypokalemia, which can be caused by decreased potassium intake, increased potassium shift into cells (e.g., mediated by excessive insulin or beta-adrenergic activity), and increased gastrointestinal or urinary losses (e.g., vomiting, diuretics). Although extensive gastric fluid drainage will likely cause hypokalemia, further serum changes are expected.","bool":false},{"option":"D","explanation":"This set of findings is consistent with metabolic alkalosis caused by a loss of gastric acid (e.g., due to nasogastric suction or vomiting). Since gastric acid mainly consists of hydrogen chloride (HCl), hypochloremia is expected. Although small quantities of potassium chloride (KCl) are also lost with the gastric fluid, volume depletion, which leads to secondary hyperaldosteronism and, consequently, stimulation of renal potassium excretion is the main cause of hypokalemia associated with continuous nasogastric decompression. Moreover, renal loss of hydrogen ions leads to an increased formation of bicarbonate (HCO3-). See “Acid-base disturbances associated with GI disorders” table. ","bool":true},{"option":"E","explanation":"This set of findings is consistent with metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap, e.g., due to diarrhea.

In septic shock, circulating cytokines and bacterial toxins cause pathologic vasodilation and lead to decreased SVR (afterload) and PCWP (preload). Consequently, there is an increase in heart rate and cardiac output. High SvO2 can occur in 2 out of 3 forms of distributive shock (i.e., septic and anaphylactic shock) due to peripheral microcirculatory shunting and a subsequent lower O2 extraction rate. NE causes α1-mediated vasoconstriction, which results in increased SVR (afterload). However, cardiac output is typically maintained because of β1-mediated inotropy balancing this increase in afterload.\nThe absence of fever in this patient does not rule out sepsis. Patients with sepsis are often normothermic (especially if elderly or very young).

Activated T-lymphocytes that surround Reed-Sternberg cells secrete γ-interferons, which increase the expression of 1α-hydroxylase in malignant lymphocytes and macrophages, leading to the excessive conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. High levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D induce intestinal resorption and renal reabsorption of calcium, resulting in hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia, in turn, suppresses the release of PTH, which is seen here.

In anemia of chronic disease, the innate immune system decreases the release of iron from macrophages in an attempt to make iron unavailable to potential pathogens that use it for replication, so the condition is associated with a decreased rather than an increased release of iron.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased activity of ferroportin-1 in enterocytes","explanation":"\nFerroportin-1 is a transmembrane protein that transports intracellular iron from the enterocytes and macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system into the bloodstream. Increased activity of ferroportin-1 would result in increased serum iron levels. In anemia of chronic disease, the activity of ferroportin-1 is decreased in an attempt by the immune system to make iron unavailable to potential pathogens that require it for replication. This patient with anemia of chronic disease will have decreased rather than increased activity of ferroportin-1.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased production of reticulocytes in bone marrow","explanation":"Increased production of reticulocytes occurs in anemia with effective compensatory erythropoiesis (e.g., hemolytic anemia, bleeding). Anemia of chronic disease is a hypoproliferative condition caused by a relative decrease in serum erythropoietin, reduced bone marrow response to erythropoietin, and a decrease in the systemic availability of iron. Therefore, this patient's production of reticulocytes will be decreased, not increased.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased concentration of transferrin in serum","explanation":"\nTransferrin is an iron-transport protein. An increased serum concentration of transferrin indicates high iron-binding capacity, which would be seen in conditions such as iron deficiency and pregnancy. Anemia of chronic disease is associated with low iron-binding capacity because the condition is a result of impaired iron utilization and not iron deficiency. Therefore, the concentration of serum transferrin in this patient would be normal or decreased, not increased.","bool":false}]},{"id":93,"info":"Multisystem Processes and Disorders","question":"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for a well-child visit.

Life expectancy is generally normal.","bool":true},{"option":"An additional X chromosome","explanation":"An additional X chromosome indicates Klinefelter syndrome, which can also manifest with speech and language difficulties and above-average height. However, Klinefelter syndrome is not associated with autistic behavior, increased head circumference, elongated facial features, or large ears. The main feature of Klinefelter syndrome is testicular dysgenesis with subsequent testosterone deficiency (resulting in e.g., reduced body hair, gynecomastia, and reduced fertility), which becomes apparent in puberty; symptoms are rare in childhood.","bool":false},{"option":"Three copies of the same chromosome","explanation":"Three copies of the same chromosome (i.e., trisomy) is typical for Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). Even though Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, this patient has no other typical features of Down syndrome, such as upward slanting of the eyelids, a single transverse palmar crease, a small oral cavity, or a large tongue. Furthermore this patient's elongated facial features are rather the opposite of the short skull expected in Down syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased thyroid activity","explanation":"Decreased thyroid activity in a 2-year-old child would be typical for congenital hypothyroidism, which can also result in developmental delay.

Prompt intravenous fluid resuscitation and administration of potassium is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's HE. In addition, patients should receive treatment to lower the serum ammonia concentration with lactulose.\nHypokalemia, which can be precipitated by the use of diuretics, is accompanied by the intracellular movement of hydrogen ions into cells to maintain electrical neutrality. The resulting intracellular acidosis in renal tubular cells can lead to increased production of ammonia and bicarbonate from glutamine to maintain acid-base balance. Metabolic alkalosis, which can also be precipitated by the use of diuretics, leads to increased conversion of ammonium to ammonia.

This AB exotoxin binds to the surface of host cells and enters them by endocytosis. Inside the cytosol, pertussis toxin catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of the α subunit of Gi proteins, which prevents their interaction with G protein-coupled receptors and thus impairs inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The resultant accumulation of cAMP disrupts cellular signaling pathways and causes various pathological effects in host cells. This includes the modulation of the host immune response, e.g., the inhibition of neutrophil migration.

This leads to compensatory secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which increases renal reabsorption of free water, thereby diluting serum sodium levels and causing hyponatremia. Management of hypovolemic hyponatremia includes volume repletion with normal saline. Correction of hypovolemia results in decreased ADH secretion, which increases free water excretion by the kidneys, leading to correction of serum sodium levels.","bool":true},{"option":"Physiologic aldosterone secretion","explanation":"In response to renal hypoperfusion, as in this patient with massive blood loss, the kidneys release renin, which ultimately induces physiologic secretion of aldosterone through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

The expression of 1α-hydroxylase increases secondary to the secretion of interferon γ by activated T lymphocytes in the course of the immune response. The elevated levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increase intestinal calcium absorption resulting in hypercalcemia. At the same time, parathyroid hormone secretion from the parathyroid glands is inhibited by the high calcium levels but the reduced bone resorption and increased renal calcium excretion do not level out the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on the intestines. Unlike renal 1α-hydroxylase, this process does not respond to negative feedback mediated by elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels. Elevated levels of 1α-hydroxylase can also be found in other granulomatous conditions, such as Hodgkin lymphoma or tuberculosis.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Thiazide-induced renal calcium reabsorption","explanation":"Use of thiazides (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) can induce hypercalcemia via action on the distal convoluted tubule. Inhibition of Na+/Cl- channel leads to upregulation of the basolateral Na+/Ca2+ antiporter, which transports Ca2+ into the interstitium in exchange for Na+ ions, resulting in an increase of Ca2+ resorption from the urine. However, hypercalcemia is typically mild due to intact parathyroid hormone feedback suppression and the effects of thiazides would not explain this patient's bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, exertional dyspnea, or anemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Chronic kidney disease","explanation":"\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) can cause hypertension, anemia, and fatigue, as well as certain electrolyte abnormalities. In cases of fluid overload, CKD can also manifest with shortness of breath and cough. However, unlike in this patient, CKD typically results in hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia (not hypercalcemia). Calcium levels in patients with CKD are decreased due to impaired vitamin D production. Also, excess phosphate binds to circulating calcium, which further decreases calcium levels. Finally, CKD would not explain this patient's other findings (hilar lymphadenopathy, bilateral arthritis).","bool":false},{"option":"Parathyroid adenoma","explanation":"\nParathyroid adenomas are the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism, which leads to elevated levels of parathyroid hormone in the blood, resulting in increased calcium and phosphate release from bone, calcium reabsorption from the renal distal tubule, and renal production of calcitriol.

However, the dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and chest x-ray results in this patient suggest another cause of hypercalcemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Vitamin A toxicity","explanation":"Chronic vitamin A toxicity may result from excessive vitamin supplementation, which could be the case in this patient who takes daily multivitamins. Symptoms of chronic hypervitaminosis A include fatigue and arthralgias. Hypervitaminosis A might also result in hypercalcemia as this condition interferes with the ability of vitamin D to ensure calcium homeostasis. However, this patient's respiratory symptoms and findings on chest x-ray suggest a different etiology for increased calcium levels.","bool":false},{"option":"PTH-related protein production","explanation":"\nParaneoplastic production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is a common cause of hypercalcemia in a wide variety of malignancies, including squamous cell lung cancer (SCLC). This patient's cough, dyspnea, and fatigue may be signs of SCLC but the absence of other constitutional symptoms (hemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats) make this condition less likely. In addition, chest x-ray in SCLC is likely to show solitary nodules rather than bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and normal lung parenchyma.

Because many patients who have experienced sexual assault do not return for a follow-up visit, empiric antibiotic therapy should be given at their initial presentation. Patients who do not receive empiric antibiotic therapy should repeat STI screening 1–2 weeks later because initial results are usually negative in previously uninfected patients. Other recommended interventions at the initial presentation include emergency contraception, HIV postexposure prophylaxis, and hepatitis B postexposure prophylaxis depending on the patient's profile (e.g., immunization status, serum testing results).

However, the combination of an oral progesterone antagonist (e.g., mifepristone) with a prostaglandin analog (e.g., misoprostol) administered 24–48 hours apart is used for elective abortion rather than emergency contraception. Oral emergency contraception medication (i.e., ulipristal acetate, levonorgestrel, Yuzpe regimen) and intrauterine devices are both effective options for emergency contraception.

Although two-drug regimens can be considered when there are concerns about cost or potential toxicity, three-drug regimens are more effective and less likely to result in resistance.

Citrate is an anticoagulant that is central to the storage of blood products. During transfusion, citrate prevents activation of the clotting cascade by chelating free extracellular calcium (a necessary cofactor for many steps in the coagulation cascade), resulting in transient hypocalcemia post-transfusion. In patients with symptomatic hypocalcemia, as seen here, calcium replacement therapy must be administered.","bool":true},{"option":"Parathyroid ischemia","explanation":"Parathyroid ischemia leads to hypocalcemia due to decreased release of parathyroid hormone. The most common cause is damage to the parathyroid glands during anterior midline surgeries or thyroidectomies. Although this patient's profuse bleeding and subsequent systemic hypotension may have caused tissue ischemia, a selective affection of the parathyroid glands is unlikely, as watershed areas in the GI tract and brain are far more susceptible to ischemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypoalbuminemia","explanation":"Because about half of the total serum calcium is bound to proteins, hypoalbuminemia will decrease the total calcium levels. However, ionized (or free) calcium concentrations are regulated hormonally and thus will not be affected. Since only ionized calcium is biologically active, hypocalcemia due to hypoalbuminemia usually is asymptomatic (pseudohypocalcemia) and would not explain this patient's symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Metabolic acidosis","explanation":"\nMetabolic acidosis reduces the affinity of albumin to bind calcium in the serum, resulting in increased serum levels of ionized (or free) calcium levels, i.e. hypercalcemia. Unlike this patient's presentation, hypercalcemia manifests with symptoms such as bone pain, myalgia, abdominal pain, constipation, polyuria, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Symptomatic hypocalcemia could, however, be caused by metabolic alkalosis leading to an increased albumin-calcium binding.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute kidney injury","explanation":"\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is unlikely to cause the acute hypocalcemia seen in this patient even though profuse bleeding and subsequent systemic hypotension puts her at risk for AKI (or a clinical prerenal azotemia).

Maintaining organ perfusion is the primary goal of IV fluid therapy in burn patients. Initially, the approximate volume of fluid required may be estimated (e.g., based on the total body surface area involved), however, this is merely a starting point, and IV fluid volume should be titrated to maintain a urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/h in adults (1 mL/kg/h in children). Although heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored in patients with burns, these parameters are not good indicators of overall organ perfusion. If urine output falls below 0.5 mL/kg/h, a 500–1000 mL bolus of crystalloid fluid should be given, and the maintenance infusion rate should be increased by 20–30%.","bool":true},{"option":"The Holliday-Segar formula","explanation":"The Holliday-Segar formula may be used to estimate maintenance fluid requirements. However, the fluid requirement of patients with burns during the first 24 hours far exceeds the estimate provided by the Holliday-Segar formula.

Blood pressure is therefore underestimated. If more fluid were administered to the patient based on a misinterpretation of blood pressure, edema in the limb would worsen, and the risk of pulmonary edema would increase. Also, blood pressure may be normal despite decreased intravascular fluid volume and end-organ perfusion in a patient with an intact vasomotor response and would only begin to decrease once shock sets in. Even intraarterial manometry may be unreliable because of peripheral vasoconstriction by stress hormones (e.g., catecholamines).","bool":false},{"option":"The Parkland formula","explanation":"The Parkland formula is a tool commonly used to estimate fluid requirements during the first 24 hours of care in burn patients. While this is a good tool for estimating this patient's initial fluid requirements, it is merely an estimate. Another method can more accurately verify if fluid resuscitation is adequate.

Additionally, ESR and CK elevation would not be seen in MS. Finally, if MS were suspected, this patient would need an MRI before LP would be indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Skin biopsy","explanation":"\nSkin biopsy is a common diagnostic test in patients with suspected dermatomyositis. Like PM, dermatomyositis causes progressive proximal, symmetrical muscle weakness.

Most importantly, this patient's normal TSH rules out hypothyroidism.","bool":false},{"option":"Temporal artery biopsy","explanation":"A temporal artery biopsy is indicated in patients with suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA), a vasculitis that characteristically leads to elevated ESR. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PR) is an inflammatory condition that occurs in approximately half of patients with GCA (usually women above the age of 50 years). However, PR manifests with proximal muscle pain and stiffness, and not weakness, which is seen in this patient.

","answers":[{"option":"Decreased cerebral blood flow","explanation":"\nHyperventilation increases minute ventilation and the elimination of carbon dioxide, resulting in hypocapnia. The physiologic response to hypocapnia is cerebral vasoconstriction and decreased cerebral blood flow. Patients who hyperventilate may present with lightheadedness as a result. In order to balance the increase in pH (i.e., alkalosis), protein-bound H+ ions are released from their binding site to albumin. As a result, ionized Ca2+ binds to albumin, which results in a decrease in ionized Ca2+ while the total serum concentration of calcium remains unchanged.

The buildup of MMA and its precursor propionyl-CoA, as well as their associated odd-chain fatty acids, cannot be completely metabolized, which leads to neuron damage (e.g., through propionyl-CoA replacing acetyl-CoA in neuronal membranes). The result is demyelination that leads to neurological manifestations; demyelination of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord results in subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, which is commonly seen in vitamin B12 deficiency.\nVitamin B12 deficiency also results in elevated homocysteine levels because it is a coenzyme during conversion of homocysteine to methionine via the methionine synthase. Elevated homocysteine increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine can also be elevated in folate deficiency, which also causes megaloblastic anemia, whereas MMA is normal.","bool":true},{"option":"Basophilic stippling on peripheral smear","explanation":"\nBasophilic stippling is a nonspecific finding found in lead intoxication.

Propionyl-CoA carboxylase converts propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, which is converted to succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Succinyl-CoA generates oxaloacetate via the TCA cycle, which can be used to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis). A deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase or methylmalonyl-CoA mutase can, therefore, cause symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., muscular hypotonia, vomiting, and lethargy), failure to thrive, and HAGMA due to the accumulation of propionic acid, which is subsequently excreted in urine.","bool":true},{"option":"Even-chain fatty acids","explanation":"\nBeta-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids can generate both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA (propionic acid coupled with coenzyme A), but the breakdown of even-chain fatty acids only produces acetyl-CoA.

Propionic acid is not formed during the process of catecholamine catabolism.","bool":false},{"option":"Hexose monosaccharides","explanation":"Examples of hexose monosaccharides include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Catabolism of glucose and galactose by aldose reductase can form sorbitol and galactitol, respectively. Galactitol can accumulate in newborns with galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency and cause lethargy, vomiting, failure to thrive, and generalized hypotonia. However, urinalysis would show reducing substances, not propionic acid.

Fibrates can potentially cause myopathy as an adverse effect. When combined with statins, which can also independently cause myopathy, the risk of myoglobinuria is even higher. This risk is especially high because fibrates inhibit CYP3A4, the isoenzyme that metabolizes most statins in the cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway, and thus increase the statin concentration.","bool":true},{"option":"Bleeding from minor trauma","explanation":"Bleeding from minor trauma can be a sign of vitamin K deficiency. Bile acid sequestrants, like cholestyramine, lower cholesterol and LDL by decreasing the reabsorption of bile acids and interrupting the enterohepatic circulation.

Another specific effect of TCAs is responsible for a wide QRS complex on ECG.","answers":[{"option":"Fast sodium channel blockade","explanation":"\nTCAs directly inhibit fast sodium channels and cause an intraventricular conduction delay, which manifests as wide QRS complexes. Wide QRS complexes correlate positively with the risk of seizures and ventricular tachyarrhythmias from TCA toxicity. A QRS complex &gt; 100 ms in duration is, therefore, an indication for initiating sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) therapy in patients with TCA overdose. NaHCO3 therapy, which increases extracellular Na+ concentration, leads to an increased Na+ concentration gradient across the cellular membrane and thereby attenuates the Na+ channel blockade. In patients with CNS depression, avoidance of respiratory acidosis is important because acidemia increases the release of lipid- and protein-bound TCA as well as the binding of TCA to Na+ channels. NaHCO3 therapy as well as early intubation and mechanical ventilation is helpful in this regard.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased potassium loss","explanation":"Increased potassium loss is seen in patients with anorexia nervosa, commonly as a result of laxative abuse.

IgAV is most commonly preceded by a viral infection, which is presumed to trigger an increase in IgA production, consequent deposition of IgA immune complexes in vessels, and activation of the complement cascade. Involvement of the intestinal wall vessels results in intestinal wall edema and thickening, which may act as a nidus for intussusception, as seen here. Patients with renal-vessel involvement develop IgA immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis (IgA nephropathy).

However, heat exhaustion-associated hypernatremia is typically accompanied by hypovolemia as a result of hypotonic fluid losses from excessive sweating, and it first requires volume repletion with isotonic fluids. Hypotonic saline is not recommended for fluid resuscitation in children because of the high risk of severe side effects (e.g., cerebral edema, irreversible neurological injury).

Impaired ciliary function reduces mucociliary clearance, resulting in bronchiectasis (due to recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, which are responsible for this patient's crackles and wheezing on examination) and chronic sinusitis. It also renders sperm immotile, which reduces fertility, and can cause dextrocardia (because cilia are responsible for the position of internal organs during embryological development). Other clinical features of PCD include chronic otitis media and conductive hearing loss.

The incidence of Lyme disease is highest in the Northeast and upper Midwest of the US and outdoor workers (e.g., rangers, landscapers, farmers) are at an increased risk of infection. Patients may initially have arthralgia or myalgia as a part of the flu-like symptoms of stage I disease. Stage II disease can manifest with migratory arthralgia, which can progress to Lyme arthritis (i.e., stage III; late Lyme disease) if left untreated. Arthrocentesis findings in patients with Lyme arthritis typically include yellow cloudy fluid, leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, the absence of crystals, and a negative Gram stain and culture; however, these findings are nonspecific. This patient's presentation of arthritis of the knee, preceded by several weeks of migratory arthralgia, in combination with the arthrocentesis findings is consistent with Lyme arthritis.\nTwo-step serological testing is indicated to confirm the exposure: An ELISA test should be used as a screening test followed by a Western blot to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi.

However, other characteristic features of reactive arthritis, such as conjunctivitis and urethritis, are not present in this patient. In addition, there is no history of recent gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Gonococcal arthritis","explanation":"Gonococcal arthritis is caused by Neisseria gonorrhea, the most common cause of septic arthritis in sexually active young adults. Common manifestations of gonococcal arthritis include fever, chills, progressive rash, migratory polyarthralgia, and/or tenosynovitis. In addition, isolated purulent gonococcal arthritis typically manifests as monoarthritis (e.g., of the knee), as seen here, or asymmetric oligoarthritis. Gram staining is often negative and more than half of cases have a negative synovial fluid culture. However, leukocyte count is typically &gt; 50,000/mm3 in gonococcal arthritis.

In a high-pressure environment (e.g., during scuba diving), a large amount of gas (primarily nitrogen) is dissolved in blood and tissue fluid. With a sudden subsequent decrease in pressure (e.g., during rapid ascent), air bubbles form because the gas is no longer dissolved (Henry's law) and they begin to expand (Boyle's law). These bubbles cause local tissue damage and are primarily responsible for the multisystem manifestations of DCS, which can also include chest pain, dyspnea, myalgia, arthralgia, pruritus, painful lymphadenopathy, and lymphedema. In severe cases, air embolization can also occur. In HBOT, the patient is placed in a high-pressure chamber to decrease the number and volume of any air bubbles that have already formed, and the chamber pressure is then decreased to atmospheric pressure at a slow rate to prevent the formation of new bubbles. While in the chamber, the patient receives 100% oxygen, which creates a gradient for the diffusion of nitrogen out of the body via the lungs.\nPatients who do not fully respond to therapy may require multiple sessions until complete resolution or until there is no further improvement. If an HBOT facility is not readily available, the patient should receive 100% oxygen until the patient can be moved to such a facility. Prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (for those with lower extremity paralysis) and adequate hydration are also recommended as adjunctive therapy in DCS.","bool":true},{"option":"Lumbar decompression surgery","explanation":"Urgent lumbar decompression surgery is required to treat acute and severe spinal canal stenosis (e.g., due to trauma or disk herniation), which can similarly manifest with paresis, sensory deficits, and urinary incontinence.

This patient with DCS and lower extremity paralysis requires thromboprophylaxis but not thrombolytic therapy.","bool":false},{"option":"Trendelenburg positioning","explanation":"In the Trendelenburg position, the outflow tracts of the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) are at a lower level than the cavities of these ventricles. This position is used to prevent obstructive shock from large venous air emboli because it allows air to accumulate near the RV wall instead of blocking the RV outflow tract. The position can also decrease the risk of arterial air emboli reaching the cerebral circulation. Although patients with severe DCS can develop venous and arterial air emboli, cerebral edema due to localized tissue damage is a much more common complication of DCS. The Trendelenburg position increases cerebral perfusion and can worsen cerebral edema and is, therefore, no longer recommended for DCS.","bool":false},{"option":"Induced hypothermia","explanation":"Induced hypothermia (therapeutic hypothermia) is used following ischemic stroke and return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest.

Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window, and any cause of renal impairment (e.g., chronic kidney disease, NSAID use) or volume depletion (e.g., due to diuretic therapy, cardiovascular disease) can precipitate lithium toxicity. Older patients (&gt; 65 years of age) are particularly at risk for lithium toxicity, given their overall lower decreased glomerular filtration rate. To ensure safety, frequent monitoring of lithium levels is recommended in all patients taking lithium, particularly when starting a new medication.","bool":true},{"option":"Acetaminophen","explanation":"Advanced acetaminophen toxicity can lead to changes in mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause myoclonic movements that may be confused for a myoclonic seizure. There is no evidence, however, that this patient consumed high doses of acetaminophen, and he does not have other features of advanced acetaminophen toxicity, such as jaundice or bleeding diathesis. Acetaminophen undergoes hepatic clearance, does not interfere with renal excretion and reabsorption of lithium, and is not known to precipitate lithium toxicity.","bool":false},{"option":"Valproic acid","explanation":"\nValproic acid overdose can cause altered mental status and myoclonic movements. However, it is unlikely to cause myoclonic seizures because it is an anticonvulsant.

Therefore, valproic acid is unlikely to precipitate lithium toxicity.","bool":false},{"option":"Theophylline","explanation":"\nTheophylline toxicity can cause neurologic symptoms (e.g., seizures and tremors) and while it may exclusively manifest with neurologic symptoms, other features (e.g., tachycardia, arrhythmias) are also commonly seen. Additionally, theophylline is not routinely prescribed for asthma due to the risk of toxicity. Finally, since theophylline increases renal clearance and decreases serum concentrations of lithium, it is unlikely to precipitate lithium toxicity. This patient's symptoms are more likely to result from lithium toxicity following the prescription of more commonly used medication.","bool":false},{"option":"Fluoxetine","explanation":"Concurrent use of fluoxetine and lithium increases the risk of developing serotonin syndrome, which can result in myoclonus, altered mental status, and, in severe cases, seizures. However, serotonin syndrome typically develops within hours of initiating or increasing the dose of a precipitating drug and would be unlikely in this patient, who presents 10 days after starting a new medication.

Patients can further develop signs of shock (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, altered mental status) and/or end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypoxemia, bilateral crackles), all of which are seen here. About half of TSS cases are caused by prolonged use of tampons over several days, which creates an ideal breeding ground for vaginal colonization and subsequent toxin formation.

The normal physiologic response to increased body temperature is hypothalamus-mediated peripheral vasodilation (to expose blood to the cooler air) and sweating (to dissipate heat into the environment). In older individuals, these control mechanisms are impaired because of reduced vasodilation and surface area for conductive heat loss. Accordingly, the hypothalamus is less able to adequately regulate temperature in this population, thereby increasing the risk for heatstroke.

Biopsy findings showing periportal hepatocytes with brownish yellow color, which indicates iron accumulation, is characteristic of the condition.","answers":[{"option":"Defective transferrin receptor binding","explanation":"The HFE gene codes for a membrane protein (HFE protein) that takes part in regulating iron uptake by facilitating the interaction of transferrin (and its bound iron) with its receptors. In hemochromatosis, the HFE gene is mutated; this leads to defective binding of transferrin to its receptor, which signals decreased iron stores. In response, the liver stops producing the hormone hepcidin, allowing increased iron reabsorption via unregulated ferroportin in duodenal enterocytes. The resulting iron overload leads to accumulation of bodily iron, causing manifestations such as this patient's hyperpigmented skin and diabetes mellitus. His accumulation of hepatic iron also puts him at risk of cirrhosis, which is common in cases of untreated hemochromatosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Upregulation of erythropoietin production","explanation":"Upregulation of EPO and subsequent increased production of RBC is one of the causes of secondary polycythemia.

However, patients with OI often have blue sclera, hearing loss, and joint laxity, which are not present in this patient. Additionally, while OI is often hard to differentiate from child abuse, the low prevalence of OI makes child abuse more likely in the general population.","bool":false},{"option":"Toxic ingestion","explanation":"Many rodenticides contain long-acting anticoagulants, such as “super warfarin”. Ingestion of these rodenticides can lead to coagulopathy and pathological bleeding, usually beginning about 24 hours after ingestion. This coagulopathy could cause both retinal hemorrhages and intracranial bleeding leading to altered mental status, as seen in this patient. However, coagulopathy would likely also manifest in other locations, causing gastrointestinal bleeding, ecchymoses, epistaxis, and hematuria. This patient does not have any other signs of pathological bleeding, nor would this etiology explain this patient's associated rib fractures.","bool":false},{"option":"Malnutrition","explanation":"\nMalnutrition can cause vitamin D deficiency, leading to rickets, which can cause pathological fractures of the ribs and other locations. However, this child has no other signs of bony deformities or fractures, and pathological fracture at an isolated location is less common in vitamin D deficiency. In addition, vitamin D deficiency is not associated with this patient's other findings of retinal hemorrhage, bulging anterior fontanelle, and lethargy.\nVitamin K deficiency, another possible result of malnutrition, causes aberrations in the coagulation cascade that may lead to retinal hemorrhages and intracranial bleeding, resulting in altered mental status.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"Pupils that accommodate but are not reactive to light are called Argyll Robertson pupils.","answers":[{"option":"Treponemal test","explanation":"\nTreponemal tests (TTs), such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) and the treponema pallidum particle agglutination test (TPPA), are used in the diagnosis of syphilis. Diagnosis is confirmed using a serial testing strategy. In the standard testing algorithm, a nontreponemal test (NTT), such as VDRL or plasma reagin test, is performed first. If the result is positive or equivocal, a TT is performed. In the reverse testing algorithm, a TT is performed first, followed by an NTT test. A positive result for both tests strongly supports the diagnosis of syphilis. This patient likely has tertiary syphilis as he shows signs of both neurosyphilis (positive Romberg test suggesting tabes dorsalis, Argyll Robertson pupil) and cardiac syphilis (ascending aortic aneurysm with consequent heart failure). Since the advent of antibiotics, neurosyphilis has become much less common. Patients with HIV (especially untreated) are at greatest risk of the disease. Tertiary syphilis usually occurs decades after infection with Treponema pallidum, but immunocompromised patients (e.g., due to HIV) may develop symptoms more rapidly. First-line treatment for neurosyphilis is IV penicillin G for 10–14 days.","bool":true},{"option":"Fibrillin gene mutation test","explanation":"\nFibrillin gene mutation testing would be used to diagnose Marfan syndrome, which typically manifests with tall stature, joint hypermobility, and musculoskeletal abnormalities (e.g., pectus excavatum).

Moreover, SLE can cause a broad range of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, including peripheral neuropathy (which could cause a positive Romberg test). However, common neurologic symptoms of SLE include headache, seizure, delirium, and stroke, none of which are present in this patient. Additionally, the patient does not have a history of lupus, and no other clinical features of SLE (e.g., cutaneous lesions, polyarthralgia, malar rash) are present.","bool":false},{"option":"Frataxin level","explanation":"The frataxin level can be used to confirm Friedreich ataxia (FA), although the disease is usually diagnosed clinically. While patients with FA often develop heart failure, it is due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Based on the murmur (holodiastolic, best heard at the right sternal border) and the x-ray findings (showing mediastinal widening), this patient's heart failure is most likely due to thoracic aortic aneurysm with resulting aortic regurgitation. FA can manifest with sensory ataxia (and a positive Romberg test) and can lead to optic atrophy (presenting with loss of vision), but it would not explain this patient's fever or pupillary abnormality. Moreover, this patient lacks other features of FA (e.g., foot deformity, scoliosis).","bool":false},{"option":"Blood culture","explanation":"\nBlood cultures are indicated to diagnose bacteremia/fungemia, which could cause fever, infective endocarditis (IE) and/or mycotic aneurysm, and consequent heart murmur and heart failure. This patient is at increased risk for IE given his HIV infection. Although vegetations from IE can embolize and cause end-organ infarction such as stroke, neither Argyll Robertson pupils nor a positive Romberg test (which indicates involvement of the dorsal columns and/or peripheral neuropathy) are associated with stroke.","bool":false},{"option":"Antistreptolysin O titer","explanation":"\nAntistreptolysin O is the first-line test for recent S. pyogenes infection, which can result in rheumatic fever (RF) and subsequent rheumatic heart disease. RF would explain this patient's heart failure, murmur, and fever. However, this patient has neither a history of RF, nor evidence of acute RF (i.e., positive Jones criteria). Additionally, RF may cause chorea in acute illness, but it would not explain this patient's positive Romberg test and pupillary findings.

When glucose and glycogen stores are depleted, for example, after this patient's fasting (e.g., during weaning, skipping nightly feeds) or a state of increased metabolic demand (e.g., infection, exercise), the body normally relies on fatty acid metabolism. But in patients with MCAD deficiency, a deficit of acetyl-CoA develops, which leads to hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia without ketosis, vomiting, and lethargy, as seen in this patient. Without intervention, the condition can progress to seizure and coma.\nMedium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is routinely screened in neonates. To prevent symptoms, patients are advised to adopt a diet consisting of frequent high-carbohydrate and low-fat meals and avoid fasting or metabolic decompensation.","bool":true},{"option":"Phenylalanine hydroxylase","explanation":"\nPhenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency causes classic phenylketonuria due to a toxic build-up of phenylalanine.

Hypothermia does not alter the hypothalamic set point.","bool":false},{"option":"Vasodilatation of cutaneous blood vessels","explanation":"Vasodilatation of cutaneous blood vessels increases heat loss, which is the opposite of the usual physiological response to hypothermia. Significant cold exposure would constrict rather than dilate cutaneous blood vessels by increasing hypothalamic sympathetic output.","bool":false},{"option":"Contraction of arrector pili muscles","explanation":"Contraction of the arrector pili muscles, which occurs as a response to cold exposure, traps air between hair and increases insulation (heat conservation). This process of heat conservation is, however, a rudimentary process in humans and does not contribute significantly to maintaining core body temperature.","bool":false},{"option":"Decrease in circulating epinephrine","explanation":"A decrease in circulating epinephrine leads to increased heat loss (due to loss of peripheral vasoconstriction) and decreased heat production (due to decreased cellular metabolism), which are the opposites of the usual physiological response to hypothermia. Significant cold exposure increases rather than decreases the release of adrenal medullary hormones (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine) by increasing hypothalamic sympathetic output.","bool":false},{"option":"Involuntary muscular contractions","explanation":"\nShivering, a type of involuntary muscular contraction that increases heat production, is the mechanism that contributes most to maintaining this patient's core body temperature. This mechanism is initiated by the primary motor center for shivering in the posterior hypothalamus, which transmits signals to anterior motor neurons in the spinal cord. The primary motor center for shivering is normally suppressed by the heat center located in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and activated by cutaneous cold receptors. Shivering increases the basal metabolic rate up to 5 times (shivering thermogenesis). In infants, shivering does not occur because skeletal muscles have not matured. Instead, most of the heat is generated via brown adipose tissue (nonshivering thermogenesis).","bool":true},{"option":"Inhibition of the thyroid axis","explanation":"Inhibition of the thyroid axis decreases T3 and T4 production, which in turn decreases heat production and the basal metabolic rate. Significant cold exposure stimulates rather than inhibits the thyroid axis to increase thermogenesis.

In this patient with findings suggestive of CF, vitamin D deficiency is most likely due to malabsorption. Decreased vitamin D levels reduce intestinal calcium absorption, resulting in hypocalcemia, which, in turn, stimulates PTH secretion. PTH decreases phosphate reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules, leading to hypophosphatemia. This patient's muscle cramps are likely due to hypocalcemia. Also, the patient's x-ray findings of osteopenia with an epiphyseal widening of the wrist are suggestive of rickets, which is most commonly caused by chronic vitamin D deficiency.\nFurther symptoms of hypocalcemia include paresthesias, Trousseau sign and Chvostek sign, ECG changes (QT prolongation), and, in severe cases, seizures.","bool":true},{"option":"B","explanation":"This laboratory constellation is consistent with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with CKD commonly have vitamin D deficiency due to impaired 1-alpha hydroxylase activity. Low vitamin D levels lead to decreased intestinal calcium absorption.

PTH is a key modulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and insufficient secretion from the parathyroid glands (e.g., due to thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy, autoimmune disease, or genetic disease (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome)) results in hypocalcemia. This is due to decreased mobilization of calcium from bones, decreased tubular calcium reabsorption, and decreased synthesis of calcitriol leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium.

His blood gas analysis is consistent with metabolic alkalosis (increased pH and HCO3-) with respiratory compensation (increased pCO2). The metabolic alkalosis is the result of volume depletion (contraction alkalosis) and loss of gastric H+.","answers":[{"option":"Hypokalemia","explanation":"The characteristic finding associated with persistent vomiting or excessive nasogastric (NG) suctioning is hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemia in contraction alkalosis is caused by several mechanisms. The primary driver is hypovolemia-induced RAAS activation and aldosterone release, which promotes renal K+ and H+ excretion and thereby further contributes to both hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Furthermore, in alkalemia, extracellular K+ is driven into the cell in exchange for intracellular H+ (via Na+/H+ antiporter and Na+/K+-ATPase) to compensate for high blood pH levels. Persistent vomiting or excessive NG suctioning also causes loss of K+ in excess of free water loss; gastric secretions have a higher concentration of K+ (approx. 10–15 mEq/L) when compared to plasma due to K+ leakage via KCNE2/KCNQ1 channels on the lumen of parietal cells.\nTreatment of contraction alkalosis (a chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis) consists of fluid therapy with 0.9% NaCl to correct the extracellular volume loss and replete chloride, thereby ensuring adequate Cl- delivery to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Adequate Cl- delivery to the DCT is necessary for the activity of the pendrin exchanger, which reabsorbs Cl- in exchange for excreting HCO3- into the lumen of the DCT. Correction of the volume status usually also corrects any mild electrolyte disturbances, but for moderate to severe electrolyte disturbances, it may be necessary to take further measures (e.g., repletion with potassium chloride for severe hypokalemia). See “Acid-base disturbances associated with GI disorders” table. ","bool":true},{"option":"Hyperchloremia","explanation":"\nHyperchloremia typically occurs in the setting of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (e.g., due to severe diarrhea), in which the kidneys retain Cl- to compensate for a low extracellular HCO3- concentration and maintain electrical neutrality.

The increased serum osmolality in this dehydrated patient indicates a free water loss in excess of sodium loss, so hypernatremia would be expected.

Normocytic anemia in a patient with CKD occurs because of decreased production of erythropoietin (EPO) by renal peritubular cells. Diabetes can also lead to microvascular damage in the bone marrow, which results in a reduced response to EPO. As a result, erythropoiesis is reduced and normocytic anemia with a normal or low reticulocyte count develops.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased hepcidin production","explanation":"Increased hepcidin production mediates anemia of chronic disease. In chronic inflammatory states (e.g., malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis), hepcidin serves to reduce both intestinal absorption of iron and iron uptake/release from macrophages. Although there are signs of chronic anemia in this patient, there is no elevation in acute phase reactants (ESR, ferritin), which would be expected in a chronic inflammatory state.","bool":false},{"option":"Drug-induced bone marrow failure","explanation":"Drug-induced bone marrow failure, which causes aplastic anemia, can be caused by a variety of drugs, most commonly carbamazepine, methimazole, propylthiouracil, and chemotherapeutic agents. NSAIDs, like the aspirin that this patient is taking, can occasionally induce aplastic anemia. NSAID-induced aplastic anemia, however, is extremely rare and would manifest with pancytopenia (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), which is not seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Hematopoietic progenitor cell mutation","explanation":"\nHematopoietic progenitor cell mutations are the underlying cause of myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes, and leukemias. In these conditions, hyperproliferation of malignant cells in the bone marrow can disrupt the production of RBCs by erythroid progenitor cells, resulting in anemia. Although this patient's reticulocyte count is decreased, other common signs of hematologic malignancy (e.g., lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal leukocyte counts, abnormal platelet counts) are absent in this patient, making the diagnosis less likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Deficient vitamin B12  intake","explanation":"\nVitamin B12 deficiency, which can result from inadequate intake, can manifest with symptomatic anemia. However, Vitamin B12 deficiency typically results in megaloblastic anemia (MCV &gt; 100) rather than normocytic anemia. Occasionally, vitamin B12 deficiency can manifest with normocytic anemia in the setting of concomitant iron deficiency microcytic anemia (i.e., IDA). However, this patient's normal ferritin level makes IDA unlikely. Decreased sensation on pinprick can be a neurological manifestation of vitamin B12 deficiency. However, in this patient with long-standing diabetes mellitus, the neurologic symptoms are more likely due to diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, this patient adheres to a nonvegetarian diet, which should contain sufficient vitamin B12 to prevent deficiency.","bool":false},{"option":"Chronic occult blood loss","explanation":"Chronic occult gastrointestinal blood loss is the most common cause of anemia in older individuals. While chronic occult bleeding can manifest as hypoproliferative anemia due to iron deficiency, other signs of iron deficiency (e.g., microcytosis, low ferritin) would be expected and are not seen in this patient. Furthermore, chronic occult GI blood loss would not explain this patient's azotemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Malignant plasma cell replication","explanation":"\nMultiple myeloma (MM) is a result of malignant plasma cell replication and can manifest with anemia and signs of renal failure (e.g., azotemia).

Citrate is an anticoagulant used in blood products that binds to serum calcium and can cause calcium depletion. This adverse reaction can be prevented by slowing the rate of transfusion, allowing citrate to be metabolized by the liver. In patients with symptomatic hypocalcemia, as seen here, calcium replacement therapy must be administered.\nCitrate also chelates magnesium and may significantly reduce its serum level.","bool":true},{"option":"Vitamin B12 deficiency","explanation":"This patient is on metformin which increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.

This condition typically affects young adults and classically manifests with fever, myalgia, pharyngitis, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and lymphocytosis as seen in this patient. Additional manifestations include tonsillitis, palatal petechiae, and splenomegaly. A positive heterophile antibody test is highly specific for infectious mononucleosis and confirms the diagnosis. Peripheral blood smear of patients with IM typically shows lymphocytosis with &gt; 10% atypical lymphocytes.

He has also become increasingly irritable and refused to feed for the past few days. She says there have not been other episodes of seizure or history of trauma. The boy's immunizations are up-to-date. He appears lethargic. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. He has a pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There are multiple purple and yellow skin discolorations around his chest and back at the level of the 6th rib bilaterally. Results of initial laboratory studies are pending.

Without a plausible history, SDH in conjunction with bruises (purple and yellow skin discoloration) around the thorax at the level of the same rib (indicating a firm grip at this region) should raise concerns for shaken baby syndrome (SBS), a form of physical child abuse.","answers":[{"option":"Perform skeletal survey radiographs","explanation":"In SBS, nonfebrile seizures, vomiting, irritability, and poor feeding can be the result of increased intracranial pressure due to the SDH (if the anterior fontanelle is closed) or due to diffuse axonal injury (which might not be evident on CT scan). Children below 2 years of age are prone to developing traumatic brain injury if they are shaken violently because they have a relatively large head, poor neck tone, increased water content of the brain, and flat skull base (which permits the brain to move easily). After stabilizing the patient, a skeletal survey and fundoscopy should be performed in all cases of suspected child abuse in order to evaluate for signs that cannot be detected on physical examination. Findings that support physical child abuse include multiple fractures at different stages of healing, metaphyseal and epiphyseal corner fractures, posterior rib fractures, spiral diaphyseal fractures of long bones (e.g., humerus), retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous hemorrhage. Suspected child abuse warrants an immediate notification of Child Protective Services.","bool":true},{"option":"Arrange for a meeting with both parents","explanation":"This patient's clinical and imaging findings suggest abusive head trauma rather than a fall down the stairs as stated by the mother.

This multisystem involvement together with a false-positive VDRL (with negative FTA-ABS) raises suspicion for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient's negative urine toxicology and reassuring electrolytes, glucose, liver, and thyroid function studies further support this diagnosis. In patients with symptoms suggestive of SLE, ANA titer screening is recommended. If the ANA titer is ≥ 1:80, patients can be evaluated according to the ACR classification criteria for SLE to support the diagnostic process. Other neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE include seizures and delirium. Management of SLE includes induction therapy with a systemic glucocorticoid and maintenance therapy with hydroxychloroquine with or without methotrexate or azathioprine.\nPatients taking an equivalent dose of ≥ 40 mg/day of prednisone are at increased risk for glucocorticoid-induced psychosis.

The nonspecific arthrocentesis findings, i.e., negative Gram stain and leukocytosis with increased neutrophils are consistent with Lyme arthritis. Two-step serological testing is indicated to confirm exposure: The screening test ELISA should be followed by a Western blot test to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against Borrelia. However, positive results only demonstrate exposure to Borrelia, not necessarily current infection. PCR (arthrocentesis) is best for confirming suspected Lyme arthritis in patients who are IgG immunoblot-positive.

However, septic arthritis typically involves infection of a single joint (monoarthritis) and is characterized by an acute onset and course. A rash would also not be expected before the onset of arthritis. Moreover, arthrocentesis would show a yellowish-green, turbid fluid with an elevated WBC count (neutrophil predominant), and Gram staining would show gram-positive cocci. Finally, the fact that this patient lives in the Northeast and works outdoors makes another type of infection more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Infection with round bacteria in pairs of two","explanation":"Infection with round bacteria in pairs of two indicates a diplococcus, e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative pathogen of gonococcal arthritis, which is the most common form of arthritis resulting of a disseminated genitourinary tract infection in sexually active young adults. Gonococcal arthritis can manifest with inflammation of several joints (polyarthralgia), an elevated body temperature, a rash on the trunk, and arthrocentesis showing a cloudy fluid with an increased WBC count. However, Gram staining would show gram-negative diplococci, and the fact that this patient lives in the Northeast and works outdoors makes another type of infection more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Production of autoantibodies against Fc portion of IgG","explanation":"Production of autoantibodies against the Fc portion of IgG would be consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is characterized by the inflammation of several joints, elevated body temperature, and cloudy synovial fluid with a negative culture. However, RA would involve symmetrical inflammation of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, not the knee. It would manifest with morning stiffness, moreover, rather than a rash. Additionally, arthrocentesis in RA would show a decreased WBC count, not the elevated count seen in this patient.

The larvae mature into adult filaria and become encapsulated within subcutaneous nodules (onchocercomas), which are typically located over bony prominences (e.g., iliac crest). The filaria produce thousands of microfilaria, which migrate through the skin, lymphatics, and blood to reach the lymph nodes, eyes, and deep organs. The inflammatory response to these microfilariae can cause ocular disease (e.g., keratitis, uveitis) as well as an intensely pruritic papular dermatitis with secondary skin changes due to itching (e.g., excoriations, hyperpigmentation).

This patient, however, drinks plenty of fluid (9 glasses of water per day).","bool":false},{"option":"Gastroinstestinal fluid loss","explanation":"Gastrointestinal fluid loss (e.g., from vomiting, osmotic diarrhea) can cause hypovolemic hypernatremia because the fluid losses have a sodium concentration lower than the serum sodium concentration, leading to an excess loss in water and mild elevation in the serum sodium concentration. However, patients with extrarenal water losses typically have elevated urine osmolality (&gt; 700–800 mOsm/kg). Additionally, hypernatremia caused by gastrointestinal water losses alone does not account for the marked elevation in serum osmolality seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Excess production of aldosterone","explanation":"Excess production of aldosterone occurs in primary hyperaldosteronism, causing increased renal sodium reabsorption, water retention, and potassium excretion, all of which lead to secondary hypertension (due to hypervolemia) and hypokalemia. However, because of the aldosterone escape mechanism, frank hypernatremia rarely develops. Moreover, primary hyperaldosteronism does not explain this patient's hypovolemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone","explanation":"Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone is the hallmark of central diabetes insipidus (DI), which can also cause hypernatremia due to free water loss via the kidney, particularly if individuals are unable to adequately replace water losses. Patients with DI typically present with polyuria and polydipsia in the setting of normovolemia. However, patients who have impaired fluid intake (e.g., due to immobility or adipsic diabetes insipidus) typically have more severe, chronic hypernatremia (155–190 mEq/L) that develops insidiously but is less likely to cause symptoms despite the severity of the hypernatremia. Although this patient has many features of central DI, a hemoglobin A1C of 10.5% would not be characteristic of this condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Excess water intake","explanation":"Excessive water intake occurs in psychogenic polydipsia, which may cause dilutional hyponatremia.

This patient's diastolic blood pressure decreases by 12 mm Hg upon rising from a supine position, which confirms orthostasis.","answers":[{"option":"Autonomic dysfunction","explanation":"\nAutonomic dysfunction is a common underlying cause of orthostatic syncope. In patients with orthostatic syncope, standing causes a drop in venous return to the heart, leading to decreased preload and decreased cardiac output. Normally, sympathetic tone increases and parasympathetic tone decreases, which together lead to vasoconstriction, increased venous return to the heart, and increased heart rate, all of which work to prevent significant decreases in hypotension. If the normal autonomic response to standing is compromised (e.g., medications, neuropathy), then orthostatic hypotension occurs. This patient's orthostasis is likely potentiated by her age (advanced age is a risk factor for baroreceptor dysfunction), calcium channel blocker use (which blunts peripheral vasoconstriction), and tricyclic antidepressant use (causing autonomic dysfunction).\nGiven this patient's clear orthostatic changes, highly suggestive history, and otherwise normal workup, no further diagnostic testing is required.

MALT lymphoma is the most common lymphoma in patients with SS, followed by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Other common complications in patients with SS are related to xerostomia and include gastroesophageal reflux disease, atrophic oral candidiasis, and increased risk of dental caries. Patients with SS can develop a dry cough as a result of xerotrachea and xerobronchitis (the most likely cause in this patient with a normal chest CT) or interstitial lung disease.

Physiologically, HCO3- ions are secreted into the small intestine to neutralize acidic chyme and are later reabsorbed in the form of organic anion salts in the enterohepatic circulation. In patients with diarrhea, reabsorption is decreased due to increased motility of the intestines (decreased colon transit time) while secretion remains constant. Serum HCO3- concentrations subsequently decrease, which causes an increase in serum Cl- concentrations (hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis) in order to maintain blood electroneutrality.\nAcute, severe watery diarrhea is also associated with a significant loss of K+ ions through the stool. At the same time, acidosis can cause hyperkalemia through a shift of K+ ions into the extracellular space in exchange for H+ ions, which are buffered intracellularly. The net balance of serum K+ concentrations in patients with metabolic acidosis and diarrhea is difficult to predict, but most commonly, serum K+ concentrations are decreased. See “Acid-base disturbances associated with GI disorders” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased arterial pCO2","explanation":"In a patient with acidemia, increased arterial pCO2 would be expected if the patient has respiratory acidosis.

Moreover, in acidemic states, there is an increase in serum H+ concentration, which decreases the binding of negatively charged proteins in serum (e.g., albumin) to positively charged ions, such as Mg2+, resulting in increased free magnesium levels.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased serum Cl-","explanation":"Decreased serum Cl- concentrations, in association with metabolic alkalosis, can occur in the setting of severe vomiting. However, this patient has a metabolic acidosis from diarrhea, which is typically associated with increased serum Cl- concentrations.

Adrenoleukodystrophy can sometimes present very similarly to other rare neurologic conditions of childhood (e.g., sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses). Often, the main distinguishing factor is the presence of adrenal insufficiency (usually hyperpigmented skin, but also nausea, vomiting, hypotension, etc.). It is primarily diagnosed via a very long-chain fatty acid panel or mutation analysis.\nTreatment is primarily aimed at addressing adrenal insufficiency, if present, with steroids.

Moreover, both conditions are not associated with tonic-clonic seizures, lactic acidosis, and recurrent strokes.","bool":false},{"option":"Altered allele on the X chromosome","explanation":"If genetic analysis of the patient's son showed an altered allele on the X chromosome, it could be either a recessive or a dominant mutation. An X-linked recessive inheritance is very unlikely since this patient's condition affects both the son and daughter, which implies that the father must be affected as well to pass on the mutation to the daughter as well. As for X-linked dominant inheritance, there are only a few rare syndromes such as Rett syndrome.

Since renal blood flow (and therefore GFR) is highly sensitive to changes in blood pressure and intravascular volume, urine output can serve as a surrogate measure to determine if fluid resuscitation is adequate. Ideally, urine output in adults should be greater than 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Therefore, a 70-kg man should have a urine output of 35–70 mL/hr. A urine output of 25 mL in 3 hours suggests that his kidneys are not receiving adequate blood flow and therefore that he has not received adequate fluid resuscitation.\nWith adequate fluid resuscitation, an increase in some of the other indices, such as pulse pressure and Glasgow coma scale, might occur before a change in urine output is apparent.

Lactate clearance may take even longer in critically ill patients as a result of a prolonged lactate half-life (due to hepatic and/or renal dysfunction) and/or increased glycolysis. In trauma patients, elevated lactate levels are associated with increased mortality and are used to evaluate the prognosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Base deficit of 1 mmol/L","explanation":"This patient has an increased base deficit (&gt; 2 mmol/L), which indicates metabolic acidosis (most likely due to lactic acidosis from inadequate perfusion and fluid resuscitation). Normalization of the base deficit (&lt; 2 mmol/L) following fluid resuscitation would suggest an improvement in tissue perfusion and a more favorable prognosis, not inadequate fluid resuscitation.","bool":false},{"option":"High pulse pressure","explanation":"High pulse pressure is usually caused by an increase in stroke volume (e.g., normal exercise, aortic regurgitation) or a decrease in arterial compliance (e.g., atherosclerosis) and would likely increase following fluid resuscitation.

Treatment consists of IV immunoglobulins and high-dose oral aspirin.","bool":true},{"option":"Measles","explanation":"\nMeasles can manifest with fever, conjunctivitis, and a rash, and should be considered in this patient since his immunization records are unavailable. However, the rash in measles typically starts on the face or behind the ears rather than on the trunk, and lymphadenopathy is usually generalized. Furthermore, measles would not explain this patient's strawberry tongue, pharyngitis, and arthritis.","bool":false},{"option":"Scarlet fever","explanation":"\nScarlet fever is most common in children and may also manifest with fever, a rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, and a strawberry tongue. However, the rash typically has a sandpaper-like texture and begins on the neck rather than the trunk, and lymphadenopathy is typically bilateral. Additionally, scarlet fever would not explain this patient's conjunctivitis and joint pain.","bool":false},{"option":"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis","explanation":"\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), particularly Still disease, can manifest in young children (typically 2–4 years of age) with fever, a macular rash that originates at the trunk, lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and arthritis. However, the fever usually has a characteristic pattern, with spikes once or twice daily, and the rash only lasts minutes to hours (evanescent rash) before it migrates to another region of the body. Additionally, lymphadenopathy is usually generalized, and uveitis is expected, not conjunctivitis. Finally, JIA is not associated with pharyngitis and a strawberry tongue.","bool":false},{"option":"Rocky mountain spotted fever","explanation":"Rocky mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a tick-borne disease that is often acquired during outdoor trips (e.g., hiking in Montana). The disease has an incubation period of about 1 week and also manifests with fever, conjunctivitis, and a macular rash. However, the rash typically begins at the wrists and ankles and later spreads to the trunk. Additionally, RMSF would not explain this patient's pharyngitis, strawberry tongue, and arthritis.","bool":false},{"option":"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis","explanation":"\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis can also manifest with fever, fatigue, conjunctivitis, arthralgias, and skin changes, and coronary artery involvement can occur. However, the condition most commonly affects adults between 40–60 years of age and is typically associated with symptoms such as chronic sinusitis, pneumonia-like symptoms, and pulmonary fibrosis. Skin involvement takes the form of purpura of the lower extremities or papular and vesicular skin changes, as opposed to the macular rash seen in this child. Additionally, granulomatosis with polyangiitis would not explain this patient's pharyngitis and strawberry tongue.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute rheumatic fever","explanation":"\nAcute rheumatic fever (ARF) usually occurs 2–4 weeks after an untreated group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and can manifest with fever, arthritis, and a rash on the trunk and extremities. However, the rash usually has a distinct pattern, with a well-defined outer border and central clearing. Moreover, ARF typically manifests with cardiac involvement (e.g., mitral regurgitation), and pharyngitis and a strawberry tongue are not features of this condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Leptospirosis","explanation":"Mild leptospirosis can also manifest with fever, conjunctivitis, and a transient macular rash. However, the disease is usually acquired through contact with soil, food, and/or water contaminated with the urine of infected animals and is, therefore, more common in groups such as farmers or sewer workers. Additionally, the disease is commonly associated with diarrhea and vomiting, while pharyngitis, arthritis, and strawberry tongue are not features of leptospirosis.","bool":false}]},{"id":281,"info":"Multisystem Processes and Disorders","question":"A 22-year-old man comes to the physician because of a fall associated with a 6-month history of increasing difficulty walking.

His father died of esophageal varices at the age of 40 years. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. He takes no medications. He appears sad. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His speech is slurred and monotonous; his gait is unsteady. Examination shows scleral icterus and some drooling. The liver is palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpated 1 to 2 cm below the left costal margin. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Examination of the cornea in this patient would very likely show Kayser-Fleischer rings.","answers":[{"option":"Low serum ceruloplasmin concentration","explanation":"The presence of dysarthria, gait disturbance, drooling, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly in combination with a family history of esophageal varices, which are commonly caused by cirrhosis, suggests Wilson disease. In Wilson disease, a genetic mutation in the ATP7B gene (Wilson gene) causes a defect in ceruloplasmin, a copper transporting protein, leading to a decrease in copper secretion into the bile. The resulting accumulation of copper in the liver causes hepatocyte injury, which can ultimately result in cirrhosis. The discharge of excess copper into the bloodstream leads to an accumulation of copper in the other tissues, such as the central nervous system (basal ganglia, brain stem, cerebellum) and corneas, causing the extrahepatic symptoms seen in this patient. The impaired copper transport also inhibits the incorporation of copper into apoceruloplasmin, resulting in low serum ceruloplasmin, which is diagnostic of Wilson disease.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased number of CAG repeats","explanation":"An increased number of CAG repeats (on genetic analysis) is diagnostic of Huntington's disease (HD), which may manifest with motor deficits like difficulties walking, talking, and playing video games.

In addition, HD does not affect the liver.","bool":false},{"option":"Ventriculomegaly on CT scan of the brain","explanation":"\nVentriculomegaly (on CT/MRI scan of the brain) is seen in hydrocephalus. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is generally associated with gait abnormalities, but the condition primarily occurs in older individuals and other characteristic features, such as dementia and urinary incontinence, are absent in this patient. Hydrocephalus can also be caused by obstruction of CSF passage (e.g., by brain tumors and/or congenital malformations), but such patients would present with features of elevated ICP (e.g., papilledema). Moreover, the liver is usually not affected by conditions that cause hydrocephalus.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased transferrin saturation","explanation":"Increased transferrin saturation is characteristic of hemochromatosis, which commonly manifests with hepatosplenomegaly and signs of liver failure (e.g., jaundice). Neurological deficits may also occur if hepatic encephalopathy develops. However, other signs of chronic liver disease, such as ascites or peripheral edema would be expected. Additionally, the neurological symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy predominantly involve neuropsychiatric symptoms (disorientation and altered consciousness) rather than progressive motor dysfunction.

Peripheral facial nerve paralysis is the most common cranial neuropathy in Lyme disease. If ELISA is positive, Western blot should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n","bool":true},{"option":"Cerebrospinal fluid analysis","explanation":"\nCSF analysis via lumbar puncture is not used as an initial test for diagnosing Lyme disease. Although CSF findings would include signs of lymphocytic meningitis (elevated protein and pleocytosis) and intrathecal Borrelia-specific IgG and IgM antibodies can be detected via immunoblot, an LP is an invasive test and serological testing would be more appropriate. CSF analysis is, however, used to rule out other specific causes of facial nerve palsy, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and meningitis. Facial nerve palsy is a rare finding in these conditions though, and other simultaneous typical clinical features of these conditions would be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Western blot","explanation":"\nWestern blot confirms Lyme disease through the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against Borrelia, but it is not appropriate for screening.","bool":false},{"option":"Noncontrast CT scan of the head","explanation":"\nNoncontrast CT scan of the head is warranted for facial nerve palsy if trauma or tumor are suspected, or if the clinical features are atypical, progress &gt; 3 weeks, or persist &gt; 4 months. It is also the initial test of choice for suspected stroke, an important differential diagnosis of facial nerve palsy in this patient given his history of smoking and hypertension. However, stroke is typically associated with central facial nerve paralysis that spares the forehead, which is not the case here. Other symptoms of stroke, including contralateral hemiparesis and homonymous hemianopia, are also absent. Rarely, a stroke in the brainstem involving the LMN of the facial nerve can cause ipsilateral peripheral nerve palsy, but other symptoms (e.g., vertebrobasilar insufficiency) would also be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Polymerase chain reaction of the facial skin","explanation":"\nPCR of the facial skin can be used to detect various pathogens, including varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Herpes zoster oticus is one of the most common infectious causes of facial nerve paralysis, however, the pain and herpetic skin vesicles characteristic of herpes zoster are not present in this patient.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of her facial palsy?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The painful violaceous nodules seen on this patient's shins are consistent with erythema nodosum (EN), an inflammation of the subcutaneous fat that is typically idiopathic but may be associated with certain infections or autoimmune diseases. This patient's EN is accompanied by generalized symptoms (fatigue, weight loss) and peripheral facial nerve palsy, suggesting a systemic condition.","answers":[{"option":"Sarcoidosis","explanation":"This patient presents with signs and symptoms of multisystem disease, including fatigue, malaise, erythema nodosum, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. These findings, combined with her age and female sex, are consistent with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory condition that primarily affects the lungs but can manifest in any organ, including the nervous system. Patients with neurosarcoidosis most commonly present with facial nerve palsy; some may have meningitis, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, and neuroendocrine dysfunction, such as hypopituitarism or central diabetes insipidus.\nChest x-ray is the most appropriate initial test (even in patients without respiratory symptoms) and typically shows hilar lymphadenopathy with or without bilateral reticular opacities; lymph node biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. Histopathology is used to rule out differential diagnoses, such as tuberculosis or lymphoma.","bool":true},{"option":"Lyme disease","explanation":"\nLyme disease can manifest with malaise, fatigue, and a skin rash in stage I and facial nerve palsy in stage II. However, erythema migrans, not erythema nodosum, is the rash most commonly associated with Lyme disease and appears as a slowly enlarging red lesion with a central clearing. Moreover, Lyme disease is not endemic in Idaho, and this patient's weight loss points to another cause for her facial nerve palsy.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Tuberculosis","explanation":"Reactivated and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) can manifest with a wide range of symptoms, including cranial nerve palsy (e.g., facial nerve palsy, abducens nerve palsy), malaise, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and EN. Cranial nerve palsy in TB occurs as a symptom of tuberculous meningitis, which manifests with stiff neck, fever, vomiting, and altered mental status. Moreover, cranial nerve deficits in TB most commonly involve the abducens nerve. Finally, this patient has no risk factors for tuberculosis (e.g., crowded living conditions, history of travel to a TB-endemic country). Although tuberculosis should certainly be ruled out in this patient, another etiology is more likely responsible for her facial nerve palsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Sjogren syndrome","explanation":"\nSjogren syndrome can manifest with extraglandular symptoms, such as facial nerve palsy and EN. However, Sjogren syndrome is characterized by inflammation of the salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in bilateral xerophthalmia and xerostomia. This patient's unilateral facial nerve palsy is most likely due to another condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus","explanation":"Although type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) can cause cranial mononeuropathy, DM typically affects cranial nerve III (CN III), CN IV, and CN VI, rather than the facial nerve. Necrobiosis lipoidica, not EN, is the cutaneous finding most commonly associated with DM.

Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient has features suggestive of intestinal and hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. An oval-shaped egg with a prominent lateral spine is consistent with Schistosoma mansoni infection.","answers":[{"option":"Freshwater snails","explanation":"\nFreshwater snails in endemic regions serve as the intermediate host for schistosomiasis. Parasitic larvae (cercariae) initially penetrate the skin and enter the circulation to mature, and eventually produce eggs that migrate through the venous system and can spread to the lungs, spleen, liver, brain, and/or bladder (depending on the species of Schistosoma). Intestinal and hepatosplenic involvement is commonly seen with Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma japonicum infection, while bladder involvement only occurs with Schistosoma haematobium. Unlike the eggs of S. mansoni and S. japonicum, which have a lateral spine and are shed via human feces, the eggs of S. haematobium have a terminal spine and are excreted in urine. S. mansoni is endemic to Africa and South America, S. japonicum to East Asia, and S. haematobium to Africa and the Middle East.\nTreatment of schistosomiasis includes praziquantel. Steroids can be added to the treatment to relieve hypersensitivity reactions.","bool":true},{"option":"Undercooked pork meat","explanation":"\nTrichinella spiralis can be transmitted by ingestion of larvae in undercooked pork meat, causing trichinellosis. After ingestion of contaminated meat, cysts release larvae in the stomach, causing gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea (enteral phase). Adult worms then migrate to muscles, where they encyst, causing myalgia (parenteral phase). Taenia solium can also be transmitted by the ingestion of larvae (cysticerci) in contaminated raw pork meat. Hepatosplenic involvement, as seen in this patient, would not be expected with either of these parasites. Schistosomiasis is not associated with undercooked pork.","bool":false},{"option":"Tsetse flies","explanation":"\nAfrican sleeping sickness is caused by Trypanosoma brucei infection, a parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly. Early in the course of this disease, non-specific symptoms such as intermittent fever, headaches, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgias are seen (hemolymphatic phase).

In patients with situational syncopes, triggers such as cough, swallowing, or micturition result in parasympathetic hyperactivity, which in turn leads to peripheral vascular dilation and/or bradycardia. Vasodilation and bradycardia result in hypotension and reduced cerebral perfusion, causing loss of consciousness. Situational syncopes and vasovagal syncopes are both types of reflex-mediated syncopes that are caused by a vasovagal response. Common triggers of vasovagal syncopes include prolonged standing, emotional stress, pain, and heat exposure (see “Types of noncardiac syncope” table).\nLoss of consciousness also has a variety of other causes, such as seizures and cerebral ischemia. The absence of a postictal period (this patient is alert and oriented following the episode), tongue biting or urinary bladder incontinence, and focal neurological deficits make these causes less likely.","bool":true},{"option":"Emotional syncope","explanation":"Triggers of emotional syncope include pain as well as emotional stress (e.g., fear, the sight of blood, injury). Emotional syncope is often preceded by prodromal symptoms of pallor, warmth, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, or hyperventilation, which are absent in this patient. This patient was not exposed to any of these potential triggers before losing consciousness and did not experience any prodromal symptoms, making this type of syncope unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Arrhythmogenic syncope","explanation":"\nCardiac arrhythmias are a possible cause of syncopal episodes.

Antibodies produced in response to streptococcal M protein can cross-react with proteins of certain tissues (e.g., myocardial, nerve, joint) because of molecular mimicry. This cross-reactivity triggers a type II hypersensitivity reaction that causes local inflammation, which manifests as acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Sydenham chorea, which is caused by inflammation within the basal ganglia and cortical structures, can occur months after the initial infection and is the only manifestation of ARF in up to 30% of affected individuals. Treatment with penicillin V is indicated to completely eradicate GAS infection and address the underlying cause of the antibody cross-reaction. Patients may also require corticosteroid treatment and/or antipsychotic therapy (for severe symptoms). Recovery typically occurs within 6 months.\nIn patients with chorea and a history of sore throat, a presumptive clinical diagnosis of ARF can be made.

These processes do not require vitamin C.","bool":false},{"option":"Extracellular space","explanation":"The extracellular space is the site of tropocollagen formation, cross-linking, and collagen fiber formation. Following its secretion into the extracellular space, the procollagen triple helix is cleaved at the C-terminus and N-terminus to form water-insoluble tropocollagen. Adjacent tropocollagen molecules are reinforced through the cross-linking of hydroxylysine residues (catalyzed by copper-dependent lysyl oxidase) to form collagen fibrils. Finally, several collagen fibrils accumulate to form collagen fibers. Vitamin C does not play a role in any of the steps taking place in the extracellular space.","bool":false},{"option":"Lysosomes","explanation":"The lysosome is the site at which macromolecules (e.g., misfolded proteins, cell debris) are degraded; it is not involved in collagen synthesis.

He reports that his vision has progressively improved over the past 6 months and he no longer needs the glasses he used while driving. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide, and enalapril. Examination shows 20/20 vision bilaterally. Fundoscopy shows a few microaneurysms of retinal vessels. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's improved vision?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient's improvement in vision is likely due to presbyopia.","answers":[{"option":"Denaturation of lens protein","explanation":"\nDenaturation of lens proteins leads to the loss of lens elasticity seen in presbyopia, a classic condition associated with aging. This patient is experiencing the phenomenon of “second sight,” in which presbyopia corrects a long-standing case of myopia, resulting in improved visual acuity due to lens changes.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased ciliary muscle tone","explanation":"Increased ciliary muscle tone is a mechanism that causes decreased diameter of the ciliary muscle, leading to constriction and accommodation of the pupil. It also induces opening of the trabecular meshwork and drainage of aqueous humor. It would be a mechanism for decreasing intraocular pressure in an ocular emergency like glaucoma, but it would not improve myopia during middle age. Furthermore, ciliary muscle tone tends to decrease with aging.","bool":false},{"option":"Liquefication of the vitreous body","explanation":"Liquefication of the vitreous humor is a physiological aging process that leads to condensing and shrinking of the gel-like substance. The vitreous membrane can eventually detach from the retina (posterior vitreous detachment). However, this would cause a worsening in the patient's vision (e.g., floaters, photopsia, scotoma), not an improvement.","bool":false},{"option":"Degeneration of the macula","explanation":"\nMacular degeneration is classified into two major forms: dry and wet macular degeneration. Dry macular degeneration is caused by the deposition of drusen under the retinal pigment epithelium, and wet macular degeneration is associated with neovascularization in the subretinal space. Both conditions cause decreased visual acuity, scotomas, and eventually blindness. However, since these conditions lead to progressively worsening central visual impairment in old age, they would not present with increasing visual acuity in middle age, as seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased susceptibility to glare","explanation":"Decreased susceptibility to glare can be seen in darker colored eyes compared to lighter colored ones. However, it is an unlikely pathology. Increased susceptibility to glare is a finding of normal aging, most likely due to the effects of intraocular light scatter. It is increased in patients with cataract and would not present with an improvement in myopia in middle age.","bool":false}]},{"id":298,"info":"Multisystem Processes and Disorders","question":"An 8-day-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of vomiting and poor feeding.

If untreated, affected neonates develop severe CNS damage, which can lead to coma and death. MSUD can be diagnosed by the presence of alpha-ketoacids of branched chain amino acids in serum. Treatment involves avoidance of dietary branched-chain amino acids and thiamine supplementation.","bool":true},{"option":"Phenylalanine","explanation":"\nPhenylalanine accumulation occurs in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (phenylketonuria). This condition causes a musty odor in the urine, not a sweet-smelling odor. Moreover, symptoms of phenylketonuria (e.g. seizures, delayed development, intellectual disability, eczema) do not manifest until 2–4 weeks after birth due to the presence of maternal phenylalanine hydroxylase in the baby's serum.","bool":false},{"option":"Homocysteine","explanation":"\nHomocysteine accumulation occurs with hereditary deficiency of cystathionine synthase or methionine synthase. Neonates with either of these deficiencies are typically asymptomatic but older children can present with osteoporosis, marfanoid habitus, lens subluxation, cardiovascular disease (e.g., stroke, coronary artery disease), and/or failure to thrive.

HypoKPP, the most common cause of periodic paralysis, is typically caused by incompletely penetrant, autosomal dominant mutations of sarcolemmal calcium or sodium channels. These mutations exaggerate the potassium influx that occurs in response to physiological triggers such as sympathetic activation (e.g., during stress or physical exertion) and insulin release (e.g., following a high-carbohydrate meal). Therefore, affected individuals develop episodic hypokalemia and reduced muscle excitability in the context of low serum potassium. The episodes of weakness usually resolve within a couple of hours after onset but can last for several days. The respiratory muscles, bulbar muscles, and extraocular muscles are typically spared during these episodes, and in between episodes, patients typically have normal serum potassium levels.","bool":true},{"option":"Myasthenia gravis","explanation":"\nMyasthenia gravis (MG) can manifest with episodic muscle weakness after stress or exertion, and the proximal limb muscles are usually more affected when the extremities are involved. However, isolated extremity involvement is highly uncommon as an initial manifestation of MG. The small muscles (e.g., extraocular muscles, bulbar muscles) are typically the first to be affected, and involvement of the extremities usually occurs in advanced disease. In addition, the deep tendon reflexes are normal in MG.

His ECG findings are consistent with a particular electrolyte abnormality, which indicates a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Conversion disorder","explanation":"\nConversion disorder may manifest with episodes of weakness in a patient who has recently experienced psychologic stress. However, the diagnosis can only be established in patients whose symptoms cannot be explained by any recognized medical condition. This patient's ECG findings, which indicate a particular electrolyte abnormality, and his clinical presentation indicate an organic cause for his illness.","bool":false},{"option":"Becker muscular dystrophy","explanation":"\nBecker muscular dystrophy (BMD), which typically affects male individuals and has a symptom onset during adolescence, manifests with proximal muscle weakness and hyporeflexia. However, BMD is characterized by a constant, progressively worsening course, rather than self-resolving episodes. The typical ECG findings of BMD are the result of cardiac fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy (e.g., pathological Q waves in the inferior and lateral leads, tall R waves in the precordial leads). BMD can cause a prolonged PR interval (as a result of an atrioventricular block due to cardiac fibrosis) but not prominent U waves.","bool":false}]},{"id":300,"info":"Multisystem Processes and Disorders","question":"\nA 12-year-old boy comes to the physician for the evaluation of intermittent blood-tinged urine for several months.

The combination of intermittent gross hematuria, nephritic syndrome, sensorineural hearing loss, and anterior lenticonus in a patient with a family history of renal disease is indicative of Alport syndrome.","answers":[{"option":"Defective type IV collagen","explanation":"\nAlport syndrome is caused by a genetic defect of type IV collagen, which is most commonly inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. Type IV collagen is found in the glomerular basement membrane, the cochlea, and the lens of the eye. Thus, a defect of type IV collagen may result in hematuria and nephritic syndrome, sensorineural hearing loss, and anterior lenticonus leading to vision problems (patients with Alport syndrome “can't pee, can't see, can't hear a bee”).\nThe diagnosis of Alport syndrome is confirmed via skin biopsy (showing the absence of type IV collagen alpha-5 chains in the basement membrane) or, if skin biopsy is inconclusive, kidney biopsy.

This patient had an episode of febrile pharyngitis 4 months ago that could be due to GAS. However, while PSGN would present with nephritic syndrome, it does not explain the 2-year history of intermittent edema or the presence of sensorineural deafness and lenticonus in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Autosomal-recessive kidney disease","explanation":"\nHematuria, hypertension, anemia, and raised creatinine in a 12-year-old child with an onset of symptoms during infancy as well a family history of early death due to end-stage renal disease might suggest a diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which is a cause for multiple bilateral kidney cysts. However, ARPKD does not account for sensorineural deafness and lenticonus. Instead, patients with ARPKD who survive to adolescence usually have evidence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, splenomegaly).\nIn about 15% of cases, Alport syndrome may be the result of an autosomal-recessive mutation.

CKD can be complicated by renal osteodystrophy, a common cause of metabolic bone disease.","answers":[{"option":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism","explanation":"\nCKD is the most frequent cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT). In CKD, decreased renal excretion of phosphate results in hyperphosphatemia, which leads to calcium phosphate precipitation in body tissues and subsequent hypocalcemia. In addition, there is a decrease in renal hydroxylation of vitamin D, resulting in impaired intestinal calcium absorption. Chronically low calcium levels increase the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in order to raise serum calcium (e.g., by stimulating osteoclast activity). Elevated PTH increases bone turnover and decreases bone mineralization, predisposing patients with sHPT to fractures.\nAdvanced hyperparathyroidism can result in osteitis fibrosa cystica, which typically manifests with subperiosteal bone resorption and cystic, vascular cavities on x-ray.","bool":true},{"option":"Primary hyperparathyroidism","explanation":"Although primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) can cause bone pain that may affect the vertebrae, pHPT typically manifests with hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Tertiary hyperparathyroidism","explanation":"\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism (tHPT) is caused by persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Therefore, urinary sodium excretion is decreased and osmolality is elevated as the kidneys work to reabsorb free water and sodium from the urine.

The presence of symptoms in this patient's mother and brother is consistent with mitochondrial inheritance.","answers":[{"option":"Glycolysis","explanation":"\nMELAS syndrome is typically caused by a defect in genes coding for mitochondrial tRNA. This defect would decrease the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, including enzymes of the citric acid cycle and mitochondrial respiratory chain, which are responsible for the majority of cellular ATP generation (via aerobic metabolism). In response to a lack of ATP and intermediates of the citric acid cycle (e.g., citrate), enzymes involved in glycolysis (a cytosolic process), such as phosphofructokinase-1, are upregulated. Glycolysis and the anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate generated via glycolysis then serve as the primary sources of ATP. Increased anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate to lactate is also responsible for the lactic acidosis seen in MELAS. ATP deficiency impairs the functioning of tissues that are highly energy-dependent (e.g., neurons, myocytes). Other processes that take place partly or completely in the mitochondria, such as fatty acid β-oxidation, ketogenesis, and the urea cycle, are also impaired. Decreased urea cycle activity and the lack of ketone bodies (an energy source for the brain) further contribute to encephalopathy in MELAS.\nA muscle cell biopsy in patients with mitochondrial diseases, such as MELAS, usually shows cytosolic lipid accumulation (due to impaired fatty acid β-oxidation) and a ragged-red fiber appearance.","bool":true},{"option":"Cholesterol synthesis","explanation":"\nCholesterol synthesis takes place in the cytosol, peroxisomes, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, not in the mitochondria.

Patients with CAH also have an increased risk of osteoporosis and pathological fractures due to the need for lifelong glucocorticoid-replacement therapy. However, café au lait spots are not a feature of CAH. Furthermore, other typical features of CAH, such as hypotension and severe electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hyperkalemia), caused by decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol, are absent in this patient.

Furthermore, ESR would not be elevated in hemochromatosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Membrane proteins that bind to the Fc region of IgG","explanation":"\nProtein A is a virulence factor located on the membrane of S. aureus. It targets the Fc region of IgG and protects the bacterial cell from opsonization and phagocytosis. S. aureus can cause septic arthritis and would correspond to an elevated ESR. However, this type of arthritis is typically monoarticular and most commonly affects the knee, hip, wrist, shoulder, and/or ankle.

Though more common in diffuse SSc, internal organ involvement, in particular gastrointestinal involvement, may also occur as the disease progresses.","bool":true},{"option":"Outpouchings of the sigmoid colon","explanation":"Outpouchings of the sigmoid colon are consistent with diverticulosis. Colonic diverticulosis is often asymptomatic but can manifest with gastrointestinal bleeding and/or abdominal pain in older patients with a history of low-fiber diet and constipation. If complicated by infection, it progresses to diverticulitis, which causes additional symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and left lower quadrant tenderness. This patient's age (&lt; 50 years), balanced diet, and numerous extraintestinal symptoms make diverticulosis an unlikely diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Inflammation and ulcers in the rectum","explanation":"Rectal inflammation and ulcers are consistent with ulcerative colitis (UC).

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient presents with weakness of the lower legs that improves throughout the day and with exercise, in addition to autonomic dysfunction (dry mouth, constipation) and reduced reflexes. These features together with a positive smoking history suggest Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).","answers":[{"option":"Autoantibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels","explanation":"Patients with LEMS have autoantibodies against the P/Q voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic motor neuron. In patients with LEMS, the levels of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction are decreased because the autoantibodies impair the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal of the motor endplate. This results in reduced neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness. Repetitive nerve stimulation during exercise or during nerve conduction studies increases the amount of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, which improves muscle strength and the amplitude of muscle action potentials (since the postsynaptic ACh receptors remain intact).\nAbout two-thirds of all cases of LEMS are associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer. Given this association and the patient's 90-pack year smoking history, it is imperative that he undergoes a chest X-ray and/or CT.","bool":true},{"option":"Decremental response following repetitive nerve stimulation","explanation":"A decrement in the muscle action potential following repetitive nerve stimulation is seen in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).

Moreover, while GBS may manifest with symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, this condition usually resolves within 2 months, making GBS unlikely in this patient whose symptoms have been present for the past 6 months. CIDP may persist for months but is not associated with dysautonomia or improvement of weakness following exercise.","bool":false},{"option":"Fasciculations and positive sharp waves on EMG","explanation":"\nFasciculations and positive sharp waves on EMG would be seen in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Hemorrhage (e.g., after sustaining a gunshot wound) leads to intravascular volume depletion, which decreases blood return to the right atrium (as evidenced by ↓ CVP). Low right heart blood volume results in decreased blood delivery to the left atrium (shown by ↓ PCWP), and consequently low left ventricular end-diastolic volume (i.e., decreased preload), which in turn causes decreased CO. Low CO leads to hypotension, so the peripheral vasculature constricts (↑ SVR) in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure for organ perfusion.\nThe treatment of choice for hypovolemic shock is correction of the underlying cause (e.g., hemostatic control in cases of hemorrhage) and intravascular volume repletion with IV fluids.

Neurogenic shock typically results from severe CNS trauma (e.g., spinal cord transection) and is associated with other neurologic abnormalities (e.g., paralysis). Neurogenic shock is believed to result from loss of autonomic control of cardiovascular parameters due to CNS damage. Heart rate is characteristically low in neurogenic shock (likely due to excessive vagal tone), which leads to decreased CO. SVR is low due to peripheral vasodilation due to loss of sympathetic tone. Peripheral vasodilation causes decreased venous return to the heart, leading to low CVP and consequently low left atrial pressure (and PCWP). This patient has no history or physical findings suggestive of neurologic injury and she is tachycardic on examination. Another form of shock is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"D","explanation":"The combination of ↓ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↑ SVR, and ↑ CVP is characteristic of obstructive shock (e.g., massive pulmonary embolism). In most forms of obstructive shock, blood flow from the right heart to the left heart is blocked, so blood “backs up” into the right atrium, causing increased CVP. Insufficient blood is delivered to the left atrium (LA), leading to decreased LA pressure (and thus ↓ PCWP), and little preload for the left ventricle (causing ↓ CO). Low CO results in hypotension, which induces peripheral vascular constriction (and thus ↑ SVR) in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure.

Which of the following genetic principles best explains the variety of phenotypic traits seen in this patient?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This infant's constellation of developmental delay, seizures, pale skin, blue eyes, and musty odor are consistent with the diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU).","answers":[{"option":"Pleiotropy","explanation":"\nPleiotropy is the term used when one gene contributes to multiple seemingly unrelated phenotypic effects. This phenomenon explains how a single gene mutation can cause a disease affecting multiple organ systems. Pleiotropy accounts for the phenotypic variations seen in PKU and other diseases such as Marfan syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, and sickle cell anemia. PKU is caused by a single autosomal recessive mutation in the gene coding for phenylalanine hydroxylase.\nDirect measurement of phenylalanine levels is part of the newborn screening for metabolic disorders. If PKU is detected, treatment in terms of lifelong dietary restriction of phenylalanine should be initiated as soon as possible.","bool":true},{"option":"Variable expressivity","explanation":"The term variable expressivity explains why two individuals can have exactly the same mutation on the same chromosome (i.e., same genotype), but show a different degree of disease manifestation and severity (i.e., different phenotype).

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease that manifests in all individuals carrying mutations on both PKU alleles. This complete penetrance can be reduced by a lifelong phenylalanine-restricted diet, though. However, the degree of penetrance is unrelated to the diversity of affected organ systems seen in a patient with PKU.","bool":false},{"option":"Anticipation","explanation":"Anticipation refers to a pattern of inheritance in which the succeeding generation develops a disease with greater severity or at a younger age than the ones before (e.g., Huntington disease, fragile X syndrome). This phenomenon is usually attributed to the gradual expansion of a trinucleotide repeat polymorphism within or near a coding gene. Phenylketonuria is not a trinucleotide repeat disorder but inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.","bool":false},{"option":"Loss of heterozygosity","explanation":"\nLoss of heterozygosity describes an event in a cell in which one allele of a gene is dysfunctional due to an inherited mutation, and the remaining allele is later switched off via an acquired mutation.

Blue-gray skin discoloration (most commonly of the face) can also occur and is not related to pulmonary toxicity. It is therefore likely that this patient's findings are due to adverse effects of amiodarone, which may be used to treat his atrial fibrillation. Other possible adverse effects include thyroid dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, photosensitivity, corneal deposits, and peripheral neuropathy.\nAmiodarone therapy should be stopped in patients who develop pulmonary toxicity and glucocorticoid therapy should be initiated.

Together with recurrent episodes of upper respiratory infections, this suggests a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.","answers":[{"option":"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency","explanation":"\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency arising from hyperviscous pancreatic secretions in cystic fibrosis (CF) causes failure to thrive due to malabsorption. Additionally, patients often have abdominal distention (from bacterial fermentation of undigested food), steatorrhea, and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Over half of patients with CF will later develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.\nDiagnosis of CF is usually established during neonatal screening, as all newborns in the US are screened for CF. In this patient, CF can be confirmed with sweat chloride testing (gold standard) or DNA testing.

Deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy, which classically manifests with weakness and fatigue (in early stages), followed by mucosal bleeding, curly hair, poor wound healing, and increased susceptibility to severe infection (in late stages). The patient described here does not present with any of these signs or symptoms. Moreover, scurvy is uncommon, although certain at-risk populations (e.g., individuals with very restricted diets or alcohol use disorder, older individuals) are susceptible.","bool":false},{"option":"Defect in type I collagen","explanation":"\nType I collagen defects cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which presents with very fragile bones that are prone to fracture from minimal trauma. Other classic findings include blue tinged sclera, poor hearing, and dental abnormalities. While this patient has skeletal abnormalities, he has no history of recurrent fractures or blue sclera. Moreover, OI would not explain the open fontanelle and the joint anomalies seen on exam.","bool":false},{"option":"Mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3","explanation":"A mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene would lead to achondroplasia, which presents with short stature.

In Prader-Willi syndrome, the paternal allele is deleted/mutated and the maternal allele is inactivated by methylation (imprinted). In Angelman syndrome, the maternal gene copy is deleted or mutated and the paternal allele is imprinted. Both syndromes are notable for developmental delay and behavioral problems, as seen in this patient (e.g., delayed language development, features of autism). In addition, Prader-Willi syndrome typically causes obesity, short stature, and facial abnormalities such as almond-shaped eyes and a thin upper lip.

This patient was most likely infected by a tick, e.g., the American dog tick or the Lone star tick, or touched an infected rabbit during his hunting trip. Typically, this pathogen causes an ulcer at its entry point, tender regional lymphadenopathy, and high fever, all of which are seen in this patient.\nWhile severe infections are usually treated with aminoglycosides, other antibiotics, e.g., doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, can also be effective.","bool":true},{"option":"Synthesis of RNA","explanation":"Inhibition of RNA synthesis via blocking of the prokaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is the mechanism of rifampin.

The signs of glomerulonephritis seen here are most likely caused by antigen-antibody complexes deposition in glomeruli, which activate the classical complement pathway. This, in turn, results in direct injury to glomerular cells through the MAC (complement system) and indirect injury through the production of anaphylatoxins, presenting as acute kidney injury.","bool":true},{"option":"Embolization by an infected thrombus","explanation":"Approximately 50% of autopsies of patients with IE reveal embolization of renal arteries by infected thrombi that result in infarction and/or renal abscess formation. Signs of this type of embolization include low-grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, proteinuria, and increased serum creatinine, which are all seen in this patient. However, this patient's lack of flank pain and normal CT scan makes this possibility highly unlikely.

Because vitamin A is involved in epithelial cell differentiation and retinal pigmentation, retinol deficiency results in dermatological and ophthalmological manifestations, such as xerosis cutis and Bitot spots. A deficiency in vitamin A can also cause immunosuppression, which explains this patient's recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. Moreover, this patient's recent history of stumbling in the dark most likely results from night blindness (nyctalopia), another common manifestation of vitamin A deficiency.","bool":true},{"option":"Riboflavin","explanation":"\nRiboflavin (vitamin B2) is a cofactor in redox reactions, such as those involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Riboflavin deficiency causes cheilosis and corneal vascularization.

The initial choice of analgesic intervention depends on the anticipated intensity of pain. First-line pharmacological therapy in a neonate with pain following circumcision is topical anesthetics (e.g., topical lidocaine). If the neonate still shows signs and symptoms of pain despite topical therapy, other therapies should be considered following a stepwise approach (i.e., systemic acetaminophen or NSAIDs → intravenous opioids → subcutaneous lidocaine/specific nerve blocks → sedation). In addition, nonpharmacological measures, such as breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, and oral sucrose, are always indicated for pain management.\nAlthough it was previously thought that neonates do not feel painful stimuli to the same degree as adults, accumulating evidence suggests otherwise. The sensory system is fully functional by the middle of the second trimester and both preterm and full-term neonates experience painful stimuli.

Additionally, patients often have abdominal distention (from bacterial fermentation of undigested food), steatorrhea, and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Diagnosis of CF is typically established by neonatal screening, as all newborns in the US are screened for this condition.\nIn this patient, CF can be confirmed with sweat chloride testing (gold standard) or DNA testing. A decreased stool chymotrypsin and pancreatic elastase are helpful in the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.","bool":true},{"option":"Intestinal inflammatory reaction to gluten","explanation":"Intestinal inflammatory reaction to gluten is seen in celiac disease. Celiac disease may manifest with malabsorption symptoms, such as steatorrhea, anemia, and failure to thrive, but it would not explain this patient's recurrent upper respiratory symptoms.

","difficulty":4,"hint":"Deletion of the 508th codon, which encodes phenylalanine on the CFTR gene, is the most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis.","answers":[{"option":"Sodium channels of respiratory epithelial cells","explanation":"\nSodium channels of respiratory epithelial cells reabsorb Na+ from lung secretions to maintain an electrochemical equilibrium across cell membranes. The failure of ATP-gated Cl- channels (encoded by CFTR) to function leads to a decrease in Cl- in lung secretions. This, in turn, results in an increase in the activity of Na+ channels, which reabsorb Na+ ions into cells until an extremely positive gradient is created. These ion changes stimulate passive reabsorption of water from bronchial mucous into the cells and interstitium, resulting in abnormally thick bronchial secretions.\nReabsorption of Na+ results in a nasal transepithelial potential difference that is more negative than normal. This increased difference in electrical potential is helpful in diagnosing cystic fibrosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Chloride channels of epithelial cells in sweat glands","explanation":"Cl- channels of epithelial cells in sweat glands first reabsorb Cl- from sweat, a process that is followed by Na+ and water reabsorption. Cl- channels are encoded by the CFTR gene, and defects lead to a decrease in activity of these channels. As a result, NaCl concentrations in sweat increase.","bool":false},{"option":"Bicarbonate channels of pancreatic ductal cells","explanation":"\nBicarbonate channels of pancreatic ductal cells serve as Cl-/HCO3- exchangers, in which extracellular Cl- are exchanged for intracellular HCO3-.

Urinary loss of proteins, such as antithrombin III, can lead to a hypercoagulable state and subsequent formation of venous and arterial thrombosis. Renal vein thromboses secondary to nephrotic syndrome are often asymptomatic and identified incidentally (e.g., during evaluation of a pulmonary embolism). However, sudden development of flank pain and gross hematuria, as seen in this patient, can be caused by an acute, complete renal vein thrombosis.\nAdditional loss of protein (mainly albumin) reduces intravascular oncotic pressure, leading to fluid shifting into the extravascular space (e.g., lower extremity edema, ascites).

There is no specific antidote for barbiturate overdose.","bool":true},{"option":"Activated charcoal and flumazenil","explanation":"\nActivated charcoal may be used to prevent gastrointestinal absorption of medications (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, tricyclic antidepressants, and some barbiturates). However, it should be administered within two hours of ingestion, and this patient's ingestion time is unknown. Furthermore, there is debate over whether it is effective even when administered immediately after ingestion of medicine. Moreover, flumazenil is used in the treatment of overdose with benzodiazepines, not barbiturates.","bool":false},{"option":"Endotracheal intubation and N-acetylcysteine","explanation":"\nEndotracheal intubation may be indicated in patients with a depressed GCS and respiratory depression. N-acetylcysteine is indicated for acetaminophen overdose, which is typically asymptomatic or manifests with mild symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, pallor, lethargy) during the first 24 hours and potentially progressing to acute liver failure within days to weeks. N-acetylcysteine, however, is not indicated for barbiturate overdose.","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous fluids and naloxone","explanation":"Intravenous fluid resuscitation is indicated for intoxicated patients with hypotension to prevent cardiovascular collapse, and naloxone is used to treat individuals with suspected opioid overdose. Overdose of opioids can also manifest with altered consciousness, lethargy, respiratory depression, and hypotension. However, the absence of other clinical features consistent with opioid overdose (e.g., miosis) in this patient combined with his history of barbiturate use makes another etiology likely. A different step in management is therefore needed.","bool":false},{"option":"Cardiac monitoring and physostigmine","explanation":"\nBarbiturate poisoning is an indication for continuous cardiac monitoring for arrhythmias, which may require emergent medical management to prevent death, starting with an ECG and followed by telemetry. However, this patient's GCS of 8 and respiratory suppression suggest that an earlier step in the initial evaluation of critically ill patients should be addressed first. Moreover, physostigmine is used to treat anticholinergic poisoning (e.g., atropine overdose) and is not indicated for barbiturate overdose.","bool":false}]},{"id":395,"info":"Multisystem Processes and Disorders","question":"\nA 27-year-old man is brought to a mountain base camp at 4000 m (13,100 ft) above sea level because he has had a 2-hour history of confusion, difficulties walking, and decreased responsiveness. He has been participating in a 5-day hiking trip in which the group has ascended 1500 m (4900 ft) from the base camp in 2 days. This morning, the third day of the trip, the patient was found in his tent unable to respond to simple questions and having wet himself. The night before, he reported headaches, dizziness, and nausea. He appears lethargic. Temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Neurological examination shows slurred speech and an ataxic gait. Kernig sign is absent. Further diagnostic studies cannot be performed due to limited medical equipment. The most appropriate initial step in management is the administration of which of the following?\n","difficulty":5,"hint":"Headaches, dizziness, and nausea while at an altitude over 2500 m (8000 ft) above sea level suggests acute mountain sickness (AMS). Altered consciousness, ataxia, and urinary incontinence are consistent with high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), a life-threatening complication of AMS.","answers":[{"option":"Dexamethasone","explanation":"\nDexamethasone is a rescue medication for HACE that may significantly improve the patient's condition, and it should be administered as soon as this complication is suspected. However, dexamethasone does not replace the need for immediate descent to a lower altitude, which is the definitive treatment. Oxygen supplementation and portable hyperbaric therapy are further lifesaving measures if immediate evacuation is not possible. The most effective preventive measure for AMS and HACE is a slow ascent.","bool":true},{"option":"Acetazolamide","explanation":"\nAcetazolamide accelerates acclimatization to high altitude via multiple mechanisms (e.g., increased renal excretion of bicarbonate, increased ventilation and oxygenation) and is, therefore, used in the prevention and treatment of AMS. Acetazolamide is not, however, effective in the treatment of HACE.","bool":false},{"option":"Nifedipine","explanation":"\nNifedipine is used in the prevention and treatment of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), a complication of AMS.

While some of this patient's symptoms are also seen in acute psychosis (confusion, decreased responsiveness, slurred speech), loss of bladder control, headaches, dizziness, nausea, and ataxia are not expected. Moreover, typical symptoms of acute psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions, are not present. Finally, this patient has no reported history of mental illness that could lead to acute psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder).","bool":false},{"option":"Mannitol","explanation":"\nMannitol is used in the treatment of cerebral edema.

His mother has noticed that he frequently falls while running. He was born at term and the pregnancy was uncomplicated. He has a seizure disorder treated with phenytoin. He is at the 20th percentile for height and at 30th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows decreased muscle strength in the lower extremities. There is a deep groove below the costal margins bilaterally. An x-ray of the lower extremities is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The x-ray shows bilateral genu varum, widening of the epiphyseal plates, and metaphyseal fraying and cupping.","answers":[{"option":"Metabolic abnormality","explanation":"This boy presents with rickets, a condition characterized by defective bone and epiphyseal plate mineralization due to vitamin D deficiency. In this patient, this condition is most likely due to an altered vitamin D metabolism as an adverse effect of the anticonvulsant treatment he is receiving. Phenytoin, a cytochrome P450 inducer increases the catabolism of vitamin D into inactive metabolites. Decreased vitamin D levels reduce intestinal calcium absorption, resulting in hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and secondary hypophosphatemia, which impair bone calcification and mineralization. Typical clinical features of rickets include myopathy, Harrison groove, genu varum, bowing of the long bones of the lower limbs, and widening of the epiphyseal plates.\nThe most common cause of rickets is inadequate intake of vitamin D and/or calcium.","bool":true},{"option":"Normal development","explanation":"While genu varum is a normal finding in newborns, infants, and toddlers (physiological varus), the lower limbs gradually straighten until 2 years of age. The presence of varus beyond 2 years of age, along with the other clinical features with which this 6-year-old child presents, is suggestive of a pathological varus deformity.","bool":false},{"option":"Heavy metal toxicity","explanation":"Chronic exposure to lead (e.g., in soil or lead-based paint) can cause lead toxicity. Children with lead toxicity can present with growth retardation, myopathy, and pathological genu varum. However, this patient does not have other, more common symptoms of lead toxicity such as abdominal pain, anemia, gingival hyperpigmentation, and polyneuropathy. Moreover, the presence of the subcostal groove in this patient cannot be explained by lead toxicity.","bool":false},{"option":"Proximal tibial epiphyseal plate disruption","explanation":"Disruption of normal cartilage growth at the proximal tibial epiphyseal plate results in Blount disease. This condition causes bowed legs in young children, but the pathology is localized to the proximal tibial epiphyseal plates and does not explain the myopathy or the subcostal groove seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Dysplastic disease of the bone","explanation":"\nSkeletal dysplasias like osteogenesis imperfecta and achondroplasia can cause growth retardation and pathological genu varum. However, other characteristic features of these conditions (e.g., blue sclerae and hearing loss for osteogenesis imperfecta; macrocephaly and short, plump extremities for achondroplasia) are not present in this child. Furthermore, skeletal dysplasias do not cause myopathy or subcostal groove.","bool":false},{"option":"Neoplastic growth","explanation":"Certain tumors of the bone (e.g., ossifying fibroma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis) can cause deformities (e.g., bowing) of the affected limb in pediatric patients. However, most bone tumors are asymptomatic or present with localized pain, swelling or pathological fractures. Bilaterally symmetrical bowing of the legs, myopathy, and a subcostal groove are inconsistent with this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Fracture sequelae","explanation":"Although an epiphyseal plate fracture (i.e., Salter-Harris fracture) could cause angular deformities of the affected limb (e.g., genu varum), a bilateral symmetrical occurrence is highly unlikely and would not explain this patient's other clinical features. More importantly, he has no signs of healing fractures on the x-ray, nor a history of pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight on the affected side.","bool":false}]},{"id":397,"info":"Multisystem Processes and Disorders","question":"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, muscle weakness, and muscle cramps for the past week.

Physical examination shows dry mucous membranes, dry skin, and decreased deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities. An ECG shows prominent U waves and T wave flattening. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's ECG findings?","difficulty":4,"hint":"Fatigue, muscle weakness, and hyporeflexia are nonspecific findings of several electrolyte abnormalities including both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia. However, the ECG findings of prominent U waves and T wave flattening are features of hypokalemia while the ECG findings of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, flattened P waves, and a widened QRS interval.","answers":[{"option":"Polyethylene glycol misuse","explanation":"\nPurging behaviors are commonly seen in individuals with eating disorders (e.g., bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa), as well as individuals trying to lose weight rapidly. Signs of dehydration (e.g., dry skin), and rapid weight loss in a young individual should raise suspicion for purging behaviors. Common purging behaviors include self-induced vomiting, laxative misuse, and diuretic misuse. Hypokalemia can occur in patients with purging behaviors as a result of increased renal K+ loss (if the patient is using a loop or thiazide diuretic) or as a result of increased gastrointestinal K+ loss if the patient is repeatedly inducing vomiting or misusing a laxative. Osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol work by drawing water and electrolytes into the gastrointestinal lumen, resulting in rapid fluid (and weight) loss and electrolyte imbalances.","bool":true},{"option":"Triamterene misuse","explanation":"Patients with an eating disorder may use diuretics as a part of their purging behavior but triamterene, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is associated with hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia. Hypokalemia is associated with nonpotassium-sparing diuretics, such as thiazides (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) and loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide).","bool":false},{"option":"Autoimmune thyroiditis","explanation":"In iodine-sufficient regions, autoimmune thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto thyroiditis) is the most common cause of hypothyroidism, which can manifest with fatigue, muscle weakness and stiffness, hyporeflexia, dry skin, prominent U waves (due to bradycardia) and flattened T waves (due to myxedematous deposits or pericardial effusion in chronic severe hypothyroidism). However, hypothyroidism causes weight gain rather than weight loss. Hyperthyroidism (e.g., in the Hashitoxicosis phase of Hashimoto thyroiditis) would manifest with weight loss but would cause hyperreflexia and moist skin. A different diagnosis is more likely in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Autoimmune adrenalitis","explanation":"\nAutoimmune adrenalitis causes primary adrenal insufficiency, which can manifest with weight loss, fatigue, and features of electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., muscle weakness, cramps). However, adrenal insufficiency would cause hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Autoimmune pancreatic beta-cell destruction","explanation":"Autoimmune pancreatic beta-cell destruction is responsible for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), which can cause weight loss and fatigue. Insulin deficiency as a result of T1DM can also result in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which manifests with features of dehydration (e.g., dry skin) and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., muscle weakness, cramps). However, despite a total K+ deficit, patients with DKA have normal or increased serum K+ levels (since insulin deficiency inhibits K+ entry into cells) and would develop ECG findings of hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia (since the manifestations of an electrolyte abnormality are determined by the electrolyte's serum concentration). Moreover, DKA typically develops in hours, not over a week.","bool":false}]},{"id":398,"info":"Multisystem Processes and Disorders","question":"A 17-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of crushing chest pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past 2 hours.

Other clinical features may include myopia, pale skin, osteoporosis, and kyphosis. This condition is caused by several enzyme defects (e.g., cystathionine synthase deficiency, methionine synthase deficiency, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency), all of which result in the accumulation of homocysteine. Treatment depends on the underlying defect (e.g., cysteine, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate supplementation).\nMarfan syndrome is an important differential diagnosis of homocystinuria. Distinguishing features include intellectual disability, which is only seen in homocystinuria, and the direction of lens dislocation (downwards in homocystinuria; upwards in Marfan syndrome).","bool":true},{"option":"Ascending aortic aneurysm","explanation":"\nAneurysm of the ascending aorta is a possible complication of Marfan syndrome. This patient has a marfanoid habitus; however, learning disability, early-onset coronary heart disease, and recurrent thromboembolic events are inconsistent with Marfan syndrome.

Abdominal ultrasounds with views of the kidneys are recommended every 3 months until 8 years of age to screen for these tumors. Additionally, serum α-fetoprotein levels should also be measured every 2–3 months until 4 years of age to screen for hepatoblastoma. Although measurement of urinary catecholamines has been proposed as a screening method for neuroblastomas, it has not been incorporated into most protocols.","bool":true},{"option":"Serum IGF-1 measurement","explanation":"Elevated serum IGF-1 with elevated growth hormone levels is diagnostic of a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, which can present as gigantism in children. It would be very rare, however, for a newborn to present with a pituitary adenoma, which would also not explain this boy's hemihyperplasia and omphalocele.
