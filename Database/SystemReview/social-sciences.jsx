She says, “The day my brother died, my soul left my body.” Since the accident, she has had daily stomachaches and has lost interest in food, resulting in a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. During this time, she has also been tired constantly because she has trouble falling asleep and frequently wakes up from nightmares. She recently immigrated from Mexico. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 54 kg (119 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. Examination, including abdominal examination, shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is alert and oriented but has a sad mood and flat affect. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?\n","difficulty":2,"hint":"Susto is an illness in certain cultures (e.g., Latin America) in which the soul is understood to leave the body. This condition typically occurs after stressful life events and can manifest with somatic and psychological symptoms.","answers":[{"option":"\"What is your understanding of what is happening to you?\"","explanation":"This is the most appropriate initial response because it helps the physician explore the patient's beliefs about their illness before making a diagnosis or treatment decision. Open-ended questions allow the physician to gain insights into the patient's understanding of their illness, thereby allowing an empathetic response and encouraging further discussion. Patients may describe their symptoms or states of distress differently depending on their cultural background (e.g., religion, national origin, ethnicity, education), and there may be stigma around psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression) in some cultures. As a result, patients often present with atypical somatic symptoms (e.g., back pain, stomachache) and may be reluctant to accept a psychiatric diagnosis. Therefore, acknowledging the individual's beliefs with a culturally competent, patient-centered approach is necessary to avoid misdiagnosis and allow empathetic communication and management.\nCultural syndromes (e.g., susto, dhat syndrome) are clusters of psychological and/or somatic symptoms that can occur in certain cultures or contexts and may be recognized as legitimate medical conditions in their respective communities.\n","bool":true},{"option":"\"This must be very hard for you.

He appears suspicious of his surroundings and asks the doctor questions about “the security of the hospital.” The patient exhibits a flat affect. During the physical examination, he tells the doctor that he recently bought a gun and says, “It's for protection. I only bought it to prevent people like my neighbor, who works for the Secret Service, from invading my property.” When asked if he plans to kill his neighbor, he replies, “I don't and I hope I won't have to. He usually tries to enter my house in the mornings, claiming he wants to bring my newspaper.” Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient has symptoms that should raise concern for schizophrenia (paranoid delusion, flat affect, and social withdrawal). He is also in possession of a firearm and his statements convey a risk of harm to a third party.","answers":[{"option":"Notify law enforcement authorities","explanation":"Most states have passed Duty to protect laws, which allow a breach of patient confidentiality (by informing third parties as appropriate) or restriction of patient autonomy (through civil commitment) if there is potential for the patient to harm themselves or others. These laws require the health care provider to evaluate aspects such as the identity of the person at risk, imminence and certainty of the harm, and type of harm (e.g., physical harm, death) before making a decision. In this scenario, although the patient has expressed that he does not plan on hurting someone other than in self-defense, it is unclear if he can distinguish benign from hostile actions and there is a potential threat to the neighbor's life if he brings him the newspaper again.\nThis patient should undergo evaluation for schizophrenia and, if the diagnosis is confirmed, receive antipsychotic treatment. Most patients with schizophrenia are treated on an outpatient basis and it is better to have the patient voluntarily receive care before considering civil commitment. If this patient were to receive outpatient care (voluntarily or through community treatment orders), law enforcement authorities should be informed so that they can warn the person at risk (e.g., the neighbor of the potential risk of going near the patient's house). Law enforcement authorities (e.g., judicial magistrate) should also be notified after involuntary admission.","bool":true},{"option":"Administer intravenous haloperidol and request a psychiatric consultation","explanation":"Parenteral administration of antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol) is only appropriate if the patient is highly agitated and uncooperative. This patient, however, is calm and does not require parenteral antipsychotics. Long-term therapy with oral antipsychotics should be considered because the patient most likely has schizophrenia, but the threat of violence and stated access to firearms requires a different initial action by the physician.","bool":false},{"option":"Request a court order to override the patient's right to confidentiality","explanation":"\nDuty to protect laws allow a breach of patient confidentiality without requesting a court order. Such a request would delay the immediate actions required of the physician to ensure the safety of threatened individuals.

The mere presence or suspicion of a mental health disorder is not a reason to breach confidentiality. The healthcare provider should formally assess the patient's decision-making capacity (e.g., using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool) before reaching any conclusions. At this time, confidentially should be breached for a different reason.","bool":false},{"option":"Inform hospital security and detain the patient with a four-point restraint","explanation":"If hospitalization is being considered to protect the patient or others, it is best to first offer the patient the chance to voluntarily admit themselves.

The patient retrieves a living will from her purse that is consistent with her verbal confirmation that she does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, breathing tube placement, or defibrillation. Two days later, the patient's condition worsens, and she becomes unresponsive. The same day, the patient's neighbor comes to the hospital saying that he is a long-term friend of the patient and just heard that she was admitted to the hospital. He says that the patient's first grandchild was born 3 weeks ago. “She does not get along well with her own children, but it would mean the world to her to know that she has become a grandma.

Next of kin can be surrogate decision-makers only if an advance directive is not available and there is no durable medical power of attorney. In this case, this patient has a living will available and also verbally confirmed her wishes to the physician (her verbal statement would count even in the absence of a living will).

Which of the following statements by the emergency department resident is the most appropriate?","difficulty":1,"hint":"Written informed consent should be obtained for invasive procedures.","answers":[{"option":"“I would prefer that you obtain informed consent when you become available again.”","explanation":"This response is the most appropriate because the obligation to obtain informed consent lies with the treating physician. In this scenario, the emergency department resident is facilitating the overall care of the patient, but the urologist remains responsible for performing the suprapubic catheterization and is, therefore, the immediate treating physician.

A content-oriented and empathetic approach encourages family members to freely share their concerns and questions.\nMaternal diabetes is associated with a higher risk of neural tube defects, which may manifest with congenital hydrocephalus. Because congenital hydrocephalus occurs during infancy when fontanelles are still open, patients present with macrocephaly.

In over 90% of cases, the perpetrator is an individual known to the child or their family. Therefore, it is important to interview the child separately from the parent to allow for a neutral and honest conversation. Furthermore, girls aged 9–12 years are at increased risk for sexual abuse. Behavioral changes that should raise concern for sexual abuse include sexually acting-out, sexual remarks that are inconsistent with age, problems at school, aggression, regression (e.g., nocturnal enuresis), eating or sleep disturbances, and depression. Medical conditions that should raise concern for sexual abuse include sexually transmitted infections (e.g., condylomata acuminata), pregnancies, recurrent urinary tract infections, and anogenital or oral trauma.\nThe threshold for investigating any suspected case of child abuse should be very low.

Furthermore, monotherapy with benzodiazepines is not routinely recommended for terminally ill patients with dyspnea.\nBenzodiazepines are also used for palliative sedation, which may be initiated to relieve severe distress at the end of life in patients with refractory symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, pain), terminal agitation, or perceived discomfort. However, sedation should only be used after all other attempts to control or relieve symptoms have failed. The decision to start palliative sedation should be made under the guidance of a palliative care physician and/or a medical ethicist.

Risk factors for escalation should be evaluated (e.g., partner being abusive during pregnancy, victim attempting to leave their partner) and a safety plan should be established with the patient before they leave the office. This plan typically includes advising the patient to prepare an emergency kit that contains important items (e.g., documents, money), which should be stored outside the home, defining a place to go to in case of an emergency (e.g., a shelter), setting up an alarm signal for contact persons (e.g., neighbors) to call emergency services, and advising the patient to avoid areas of increased risk at home in times of escalating violence (e.g., the kitchen, where knives are stored).\nScreening for IPV is recommended in all women of reproductive age. If the partner is present during the patient interview, it is important to first separate the patient from the partner before addressing suspected IPV as confrontation in front of the partner can endanger the patient. Requirements for reporting IPV vary by state. Reporting IPV to law enforcement is mandatory in most states if there is evidence of weapon injury or imminent danger.

Her temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F), pulse is 108/min, and blood pressure is 86/50 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. Pulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The skin overlying the catheter appears well perfused, with no tenderness to palpation and no purulent discharge. Samples for blood culture are drawn simultaneously from the central line and a peripheral vein. Blood cultures from the central line grow nonlactose fermenting, gram-negative bacilli.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a nonlactose fermenting, gram-negative bacillus that causes CLABSI.","answers":[{"option":"Implementation of real-time feedback loops for hand hygiene compliance","explanation":"The most common mechanism for CLABSI is microbial spread (via surface motility and/or biofilm formation) to the CVC exit site from the patient's skin and/or the CVC hub. The hands of health care providers (HCPs) are often colonized by pathogens, resulting in HCPs cross-contaminating patients, other HCPs, and inanimate objects (leading to contact transmission), thereby facilitating nosocomial infections. Strict adherence to hand hygiene measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial infections such as CLABSI. Despite high numbers of hand hygiene stations and visual reminders at hospitals, the level of hand hygiene compliance among HCPs remains low because of lapses (due to work overload), poor situational awareness, and/or intolerance or aversion to certain disinfectants. An effective measure to increase compliance is a real-time feedback loop, in which hand hygiene observers or electronic hand hygiene systems monitor compliance and provide immediate feedback (e.g., verbal feedback on improper technique, data visualization of each hospital floor's hand hygiene process measures). Additional steps to increase hand hygiene compliance include staff training and providing alcohol-based foam rubs (which are quicker to use, more effective, and no more irritating to the skin than soap and water) at hand hygiene stations.\nCLABSI bundles (a collection of measures to prevent CLABSI) include proper site identification and technique for CVC insertion (e.g., avoiding the femoral region whenever possible), standardized checklists, and aseptic precautions (e.g., sterile glove use, disinfection with chlorhexidine) for CVC insertion as well as CVC site care, CVC removal as soon as possible, and champions-led rounding. These measures are important adjuncts but not substitutes for hand hygiene.","bool":true},{"option":"Placement of central venous catheters in the femoral rather than subclavian vein","explanation":"When compared with the subclavian vein, placement of CVCs in the femoral vein has a lower risk of certain insertion-related complications (e.g., pneumothorax, hematomas, vein stenosis) but a higher risk of CLABSI. Moreover, femoral CVCs are more likely to result in CLABSIs with gram-negative bacilli and Candida because the groin area has high levels of colonization by these microbes (due to factors such as moisture in intertriginous areas and proximity to the anogenital region) and is harder to keep clean. Femoral CVCs should be avoided.","bool":false},{"option":"Administration of ceftazidime through the introducer needle before passing the guide wire","explanation":"\nCeftazidime is an antibiotic that is effective against P. aeruginosa, and antibiotic lock therapy (e.g., with ceftazidime-heparin solutions) can be used selectively for the secondary prevention of CLABSI (e.g., for patients like this one receiving hemodialysis via tunneled catheters). However, antibiotics are ineffective in the primary prevention of CLABSI and do not have a role before or during CVC insertion (e.g., through the introducer needle). Antibiotics should only be used if indicated and, in such cases, the principle of antibiotic stewardship should be followed.","bool":false},{"option":"Application of mupirocin ointment to the anterior nares of critically ill patients","explanation":"\nStaphylococcus aureus, which causes nosocomial infections including CLABSI, often colonizes the anterior nares, and nasal application of mupirocin ointment is recommended for critically ill patients as part of the universal decolonization protocol to prevent methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection.

However, excessive sedation impairs the patient's airway protective reflexes and allows oropharyngeal secretions or gastric reflux to pass beyond the glottis. In intubated patients, these collections can pool in the subglottic region and drain around the endotracheal tube cuff, as microaspirates, into the lower respiratory tract. Using sedation assessment tools and daily titration of the patient's depth of sedation to the minimum necessary level (sedation vacation) can prevent the subglottic pooling of secretions and subsequent VAP. Sedation vacations also prevent VAP by facilitating spontaneous breathing trials and early ventilator weaning.\nVAP can also be prevented by measures that decrease oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal bacterial colonization (e.g., oral chlorhexidine rinses, avoiding unnecessary acid suppression therapy), decrease subglottic pooling (e.g., oropharyngeal and subglottic suctioning, semirecumbent positioning of the patient), and decrease the risk of microaspiration (e.g., minimizing patient transport, avoiding frequent ventilator circuit changes for the same patient).","bool":true},{"option":"Avoiding overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff","explanation":"Adequate inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff (to a pressure of 20–30 mm H2O) is required to minimize the risk of VAP.

Legal emancipation often requires a minimum age (e.g., 16 years) and requirements vary a lot from state to state.","bool":false},{"option":"Get consent from the patient's brother","explanation":"This patient's 14-year-old brother is legally a minor (and even if emancipated, not the legal guardian) and cannot consent to nor refuse his brother's medical care.","bool":false},{"option":"Delay surgery until parental consent","explanation":"Although parental consent is typically required before a minor can undergo a medical procedure or treatment, this time-sensitive situation requires a different management approach.","bool":false},{"option":"Schedule hospital ethics consult","explanation":"A hospital ethics committee should be consulted if a patient cannot provide consent and his or her surrogate decision maker is not available or thought to be acting contrary to the patient's preferred decision or against the patient's best interest. In this time-sensitive situation, another approach is indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Obtain a court order for surgery","explanation":"Obtaining a court order is the best next step in providing care if a minor's parents are refusing life-saving treatment for a non-emergent but ultimately fatal condition. This patient's case requires a prompt decision regarding immediate management.","bool":false}]},{"id":48,"info":"Social Sciences","question":"A 4-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother 30 minutes after reporting intense pain in both hands. The patient has sickle cell anemia and has been to the emergency department 2 times over the past year because of similar symptoms. Her mother gave her acetaminophen, but the pain continued. Physical examination shows swelling and severe tenderness in her fingers and hands. The diagnosis of an acute sickle cell crisis is established and intranasal fentanyl is ordered for pain control. When the physician informs the patient's mother, she refuses to give consent for the treatment. She says, “My daughter already has this awful illness, she can't get addicted to opiates too. I'm a social worker and have seen so many people get hooked on morphine and then overdose. Most of the time they got it from their doctor first!” Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?","difficulty":2,"hint":"In situations like this one, it is important to balance the ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence with maintaining respect for parental autonomy.","answers":[{"option":"\"I understand your concern. Would you mind if I shared some information about the chances of addiction in this situation?\"","explanation":"Some conditions such as acute pain in sickle cell disease require specific pain management. Analgesia for moderate to severe pain associated with vasoocclusive crises may include opioid therapy. The physician has an ethical obligation to act in the patient's best interests and relieve her suffering by providing adequate pain control. However, these ethical principles must be balanced with the need to respect parental autonomy and obtain informed parental consent. In this case, parental consent is required before providing medical care and the patient's mother has raised a valid concern. Therefore, the most appropriate response is for the physician to acknowledge the mother's concerns and reassure her by providing information on the low risk of opioid addiction with short-term inpatient opioid therapy. Studies have shown that the prevalence of opioid use disorder in the sickle cell population is similar to or lower than the prevalence in the general population, with lower mortality as a result of opioid use compared to other chronic pain conditions (e.g., migraines, fibromyalgia).\nGenerally, parents and legal guardians may refuse any treatment for a minor under their care. Refusal is only acceptable if that decision does not pose a risk of serious harm to the minor.","bool":true},{"option":"“You must have seen a lot as a social worker. Please tell me more about the cases of morphine addiction that you have seen.”","explanation":"While fostering open communication and trying to understand the reasoning behind the mother's concerns are important, doing so when the patient requires urgent pain relief is inappropriate. To uphold the ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, this patient urgently requires opioid analgesia because her pain is not sufficiently controlled with acetaminophen.","bool":false},{"option":"“I urge you to reconsider. I know you don't want your daughter to be in pain and this is her best treatment option.”","explanation":"Urging the patient's mother to reconsider her decision is the correct action in this scenario because this patient's pain is not sufficiently controlled by acetaminophen and requires opioid analgesia. However, this response places unnecessary emotional pressure on the mother because it insinuates that her decision to refuse opioids means that she is willing to let her daughter suffer. Instead, the physician should provide the mother with objective and relevant information to allow her to make an informed decision, thus maintaining respect for the principle of autonomy.","bool":false},{"option":"“If you don't consent to treatment with morphine, we can try to give her a different nonopioid medication and see if that helps.”","explanation":"\nNSAIDs and other nonopioid pain medications have been shown to be ineffective in improving pain control for sickle cell disease patients requiring hospitalization. Fear of addiction should not prevent the appropriate administration of opioid analgesics when clinically indicated. To uphold the ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, opioid analgesia should be urgently administered to this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"\"I am sorry, but in emergency situations like this, I have the authority to treat your daughter without your consent.\"","explanation":"State courts can overrule parental decisions in cases where the failure to provide established standards of care would result in serious preventable harm to the child (e.g., bacterial meningitis, malignancy). Although this case may meet the criteria for such an exception, other less combative measures aimed at fostering communication, cooperation, and trust should be attempted first. In this case, the physician should provide the mother with objective information about opioid use in the sickle cell population to address her concerns and maintain parental autonomy.","bool":false}]},{"id":49,"info":"Social Sciences","question":"\nA 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife because of a 3-day history of severe right-sided flank pain, fever, and vomiting. He has a history of gout, benign prostate hyperplasia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with allopurinol, tamsulosin, and metformin. Urinalysis shows pyuria, leukocyturia, and WBC casts. Results of blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient is diagnosed with pyelonephritis and admitted for empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 4 days, his symptoms have continued to worsen. He is somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. Temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. He is transferred to the intensive care unit and vasopressor therapy is initiated. The physician informs the patient's wife that her husband has developed urosepsis as a complication of his urinary tract infection and that advanced life support may become necessary. A written advance directive provided by the patient's primary care physician includes a do-not-intubate (DNI) order, which was verbally confirmed by the patient upon admission. There is no medical power of attorney. The patient's wife says she wants full life support in case of cardiorespiratory arrest. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?\n","difficulty":1,"hint":"A DNI order expresses a patient's wish to decline the placement of a breathing tube in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest.","answers":[{"option":"“I will perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation if needed, but I cannot intubate your husband.”","explanation":"A living will is a legal document that expresses a patient's wishes regarding health care and should be used to guide treatment if the patient loses decision-making capacity. The patient's wishes should be honored even if family members disagree. This patient's living will includes a DNI order that he confirmed upon admission; therefore, he should not be intubated. Because this patient does not have a DNR order, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other resuscitative measures may be performed if needed. Patients who retain their decision-making capacity may revoke advance directives at any time. If a patient is incapacitated, only a durable medical power of attorney can override an advance directive, living will, DNI, or DNR.\nA patient's code status (e.g., the presence of a DNR or DNI) should be confirmed verbally with the patient or their appropriate surrogate and documented at each hospital admission.","bool":true},{"option":"“This may be difficult for you, but your request is unethical.
