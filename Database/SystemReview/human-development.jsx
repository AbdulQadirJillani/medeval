At low doses (1–2 g/day), aspirin decreases uric acid elimination from the kidneys and is, therefore, contraindicated in patients with gout. Aspirin, when used to treat a viral illness, can also cause Reye syndrome in young patients. The viral infection alters the metabolism of salicylates and leads to the accumulation of metabolites in the liver. This causes hepatic mitochondrial injury that prevents hepatic ATP production, causing hepatic failure which can manifest with hypoglycemia and acute hepatic encephalopathy due to hyperammonemia.\nAt high doses (&gt; 3 g/day), aspirin can increase uric acid elimination due to aspirin-induced inhibition of urate reabsorption in the kidneys.","bool":true},{"option":"Reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1","explanation":"Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis, is an effect of aspirin.

These symptoms started shortly after the recent initiation of an oral antidiabetic agent.","answers":[{"option":"ATP-sensitive potassium channels","explanation":"In the postprandial state, increased catabolism of glucose within pancreatic beta cells increases intracellular ATP, which prevents K+ efflux by inhibiting ATP-sensitive K+ channels. This causes pancreatic cell depolarization, which opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The subsequent Ca2+ influx causes insulin release. Insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glyburide, glipizide) and meglitinides (e.g., repaglinide) increase insulin release by directly inhibiting ATP-sensitive K+ channels. These medications can cause insulin secretion even when pancreatic beta cell ATP levels are low (fasting state).

The most likely effect of this drug on the principal cells of the kidney is increased activity of which of the following?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Desmopressin, a synthetic vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) analog, is used to control nighttime enuresis if first-line treatments (e.g., fluid restriction, bedwetting alarm) are not effective.","answers":[{"option":"Adenylate cyclase","explanation":"\nDesmopressin binds to V2 receptors (a group of Gs protein-coupled receptors), which leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase. This activation causes an increase in intracellular cAMP produced from ATP. cAMP activates protein kinase A, which stimulates the insertion of aquaporin-2 channels into the membranes of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney, thereby increasing water permeability and reabsorption. Other receptors that use this signaling pathway include beta-adrenergic, dopamine-1, histamine-2, certain anterior pituitary hormones (e.g., FSH, LH, ACTH, MSH, TSH), CRH, hCG, GHRH, PTH, calcitonin, and glucagon. Certain toxins (e.g., cholera toxin) also stimulate Gs protein-coupled receptors.","bool":true},{"option":"Phospholipase C","explanation":"\nPhospholipase C (PLC) activity is increased through the activation of Gq protein-coupled receptors (e.g., V1 receptors via vasopressin). Increased PLC activity causes the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 stimulates calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to an increased concentration of intracellular calcium, which induces smooth muscle contraction. DAG activates protein kinase C, which regulates various enzymes throughout the body via phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues. Other hormones that use this signaling pathway include GnRH, TRH, angiotensin II, gastrin, and histamine (H1-receptor). Unlike vasopressin, desmopressin has a negligible impact on the V1 receptor and does not use the PLC pathway to exert its effect.","bool":false},{"option":"Steroid hormone response element","explanation":"\nSteroid hormones are lipophilic, which allows them to freely cross the cellular membrane. Once inside the cell, they bind to cytoplasmic hormone receptors, forming a hormone-receptor complex. This complex travels into the nucleus and binds to steroid hormone response elements, which induces transcriptional changes. Steroid hormones that use this pathway include progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, T3/T4, and vitamin D. Desmopressin is not a steroid hormone and does not act through this pathway.","bool":false},{"option":"Tyrosine kinase","explanation":"\nTyrosine kinase activity increases when activated by ligand-induced dimerization and autophosphorylation. During this process, a signaling molecule (e.g., insulin) binds to the extracellular aspect of a tyrosine kinase receptor, causing the two identical receptor monomers to closely associate with each other in a process known as dimerization. Further activation is achieved by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the intracellular aspect of the receptor using ATP in a process known as autophosphorylation. This phosphorylated dimer then activates relay proteins within the cell that trigger further signal transduction pathways. Besides insulin, several growth factors use receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., IGF-1, FGF, PDGF, and EGF). However, desmopressin does not act through this pathway.","bool":false},{"option":"Guanylate cyclase","explanation":"\nGuanylate cyclase activity is usually increased by nitric oxide (NO) in either its soluble or intracellular form, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation. When NO binds to soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), it catalyzes the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase G in smooth muscle cells and prevents calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This decrease in intracellular calcium causes relaxation of smooth muscle. Hormones that activate guanylate cyclase include BNP, ANP, EDRF-NO.

This enzyme traps and recycles free glycerol released by adipolysis and lipoprotein metabolism. The second pathway involves glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which reversibly converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DAP) using NADH to G3P. Hepatocytes have both these enzymes but adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and can generate G3P only via one pathway, i.e., by utilizing DAP.\nDAP is an intermediate product of both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The conversion of G3P to DAP in the liver by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is necessary for approx. 20% of gluconeogenesis.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defect in the CFTR gene, which normally codes for a Cl- ion channel that is activated by the binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This ATP-gated Cl- channel secretes Cl- in the lungs and GI tract and reabsorbs Cl- in sweat glands.\nThe K+ channels on the pancreatic beta cells are another example of ion channels for which ATP is a ligand.

Anaphase II is the phase of meiosis II during which a 2c (double-chromatid) chromosome separates at the centromere into two 1c (single-chromatid) chromosomes. Nondisjunction of the X chromosome during anaphase II causes a daughter cell to receive both 1c X chromosomes after meiosis II finishes. Anaphase I is the phase of meiosis I in which the chiasmata disintegrate and two homologous 2c chromosomes separate. Nondisjunction of the X chromosomes during maternal anaphase I causes a daughter cell to receive both 2c X chromosomes after meiosis I finishes. This daughter cell then undergoes meiosis II normally and generates two daughter cells each with two 1c X chromosomes.\nDefective paternal anaphase I followed by normal paternal meiosis II can result in a 24, XY gamete but not a 24, XX gamete.

Which of the following is the primary mechanism of DNA repair responsible for preventing radiation-induced damage to neighboring neurons?","difficulty":5,"hint":"This patient's physical examination findings are consistent with radiation dermatitis, which is caused by radiation-induced double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks.","answers":[{"option":"Nonhomologous end joining repair","explanation":"\nNonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repairs dsDNA breaks (e.g., induced by ionizing radiation) in eukaryotic cells. Broken strands are cropped by Ku70/Ku80 enzymes, forming blunt ends that allow for ligation of the two nonhomologous strands. This is an error-prone method of DNA repair because nucleotides are lost during the cropping of broken ends. However, NHEJ can quickly repair dsDNA breaks regardless of the cell cycle phase, allowing for DNA repair of neurons that are permanently in the G0 phase. This explains the preserved sensory function in this patient.\nApart from directly damaging DNA via double-stranded breaks, ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen species that cause further damage to cells due to membrane lipid peroxidation, protein modification, and single-stranded DNA breaks, resulting in cell death and mitotic failure.","bool":true},{"option":"Base excision repair","explanation":"\nBase excision repair can fix DNA damage caused by deamination or oxidation of bases and occurs throughout all cell cycle phases.

D1 receptors are Gs protein-coupled receptors.","answers":[{"option":"Increased production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate","explanation":"Increased production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) occurs with stimulation of Gs-coupled receptors as a result of increased adenylate cyclase activity. cAMP activates protein kinase A, which inhibits myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) activity. A decrease in MLCK activity results in decreased muscle contraction; because D1 receptors are present in the smooth muscles of coronary, splanchnic, renal, and peripheral arteries, fenoldopam lowers peripheral vascular resistance and, hence, blood pressure.\nIn addition to peripheral vasodilation, stimulation of D1 receptors improves renal perfusion by dilating renal arteries, making it especially useful in patients with acutely compromised renal function.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased activity of guanylate cyclase","explanation":"\nGuanylate cyclase activity is increased in vascular smooth muscle by stimulation of ANP or BNP receptors and by drugs that increase nitric oxide concentration (nitrate drugs).

A virulence factor that is actively secreted by an organism is called an exotoxin.","answers":[{"option":"Inhibition of protein synthesis","explanation":"\nPseudomonas aeruginosa secretes exotoxin A, which inactivates elongation factor-2 (EF-2) by ADP-ribosylation. Since EF-2 facilitates the translocation of the growing peptide from the A site to the P site of eukaryotic ribosomes, deactivation of EF-2 causes inhibition of protein synthesis. P. aeruginosa also produces phospholipase C, which degrades cell membranes. Together, these toxins enable P. aeruginosa to infect burn wounds and cause local necrosis. This patient's features of septic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, confusion, leukocytosis) are most likely caused by the endotoxins produced by P. aeruginosa. However, endotoxins are released by bacterial lysis and are not actively secreted.\nThe diphtheria toxin produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae also inactivates EF-2.

Malignant tumor cells release agents that promote cachexia via the breakdown of structural components of skeletal muscle cells.","answers":[{"option":"Proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins","explanation":"\nMuscle wasting in the setting of cancer cachexia is associated with the increased release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α from cancer cells. These cytokines activate NF-κB, which stimulates the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Ubiquitinated proteins (e.g., myosin chains in skeletal muscle cells) undergo proteasomal degradation, leading to increased muscle catabolism. TNF-α in particular is known to stimulate muscle catabolism via the alteration of hormone levels that regulate muscle growth (i.e., IGF-1, GH). Furthermore, TNF-α-mediated suppression of appetite in the hypothalamus, as well as peripheral activation of lipases, leads to the reduction of body fat.

Gluconeogenesis mainly serves to sustain appropriate glucose blood levels during fasting and is inhibited by insulin through activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). PP1 dephosphorylates and thereby deactivates fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. In addition, insulin decreases the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), which is an enzyme that stimulates gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycolysis by regulating the activity of fructose bisphosphatase-2 and phosphofructokinase-2. A decrease in the activity of PKA will thus further inhibit gluconeogenesis.\nThis patient's symptoms (polyuria, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status) are highly suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis, a common complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Which of the following drugs is most likely to have had this effect?","difficulty":4,"hint":"The second drug is required for albuterol to exert its full effect on its target receptor, a phenomenon called permissiveness.","answers":[{"option":"Prednisolone","explanation":"\nSteroids (e.g., prednisolone, dexamethasone) demonstrate a permissive drug interaction with adrenergic receptor agonists (e.g., albuterol), thereby increasing the amplitude of the maximal response to adrenergic agonists. Steroids accomplish this by increasing adrenergic receptor activation and the concentration of signaling intermediates (e.g., cyclic AMP). They demonstrate a dose-dependent response, meaning that the amplitude of the maximal activation increases as the steroid concentration increases.

Antimicrobials that are effective against MRSA bacteremia include vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and ceftaroline. This patient has been started on daptomycin, a bactericidal antibiotic that causes a potassium ion efflux and rapid membrane depolarization, resulting in inhibition of intracellular DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis.","answers":[{"option":"Rhabdomyolysis","explanation":"\nElevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and rhabdomyolysis are known adverse effects of daptomycin.

Concurrent use of daptomycin and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) may result in increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Daptomycin is used as an alternative to vancomycin to treat MRSA bacteremia.

This accounts for increased skin laxity and rigidity. Atrophy of the dermis due to loss of collagen and volume deficit as a result of reduced glycosaminoglycan synthesis further contribute to the appearance of chronologically aged skin. Moreover, aging skin is prone to xerosis secondary to moisture loss resulting from diminished lipid and sebum production at the surface.","bool":true},{"option":"Increase in collagen biosynthesis","explanation":"\nCollagen biosynthesis decreases rather than increases as skin ages. Simultaneously, collagen becomes disorganized. These changes are thought to be key factors in the overall decrease in skin strength and propensity to form wrinkles observed in aged skin.","bool":false},{"option":"Increase in fibroblast activity","explanation":"Age-related decrease of fibroblast activity contributes in large parts to the appearance of chronologically aged skin, as fibroblast synthesize collagens and components of the extracellular matrix, such as glycosaminoglycans (e.g., hyaluronic acid).

Macrolides are used to treat atypical pneumonia (e.g., Legionella, Mycoplasma) and STIs (e.g., Chlamydia), and clindamycin is used to treat anaerobic infections (e.g., Clostridia, Bacteroides). Neither of these antibiotics is used to treat RMSF or causes aplastic anemia. The side effects of clindamycin include pseudomembranous colitis and gastritis. The side effects of macrolides include diarrhea, QT prolongation, cholestasis, rash, eosinophilia, and drug interactions due to CYP450 inhibition.","bool":false},{"option":"Inactivation of prokaryotic topoisomerase II and IV","explanation":"\nFluoroquinolones are bactericidal antibiotics that inhibit bacterial topoisomerase II and topoisomerase IV. They are used to treat atypical pneumonia (e.g., Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae), anaerobic infections, and urinary tract infections, but not RMSF.

He can walk with support and his vocabulary consists of approximately 50 words. His maternal uncle died in childhood from an unknown disease. Physical examination shows coarse facial features with an enlarged tongue. The abdomen is distended and both the liver and spleen tip are palpable. Laboratory studies show elevated total urinary glycosaminoglycan levels and an absence of plasma iduronate-2-sulfatase. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Iduronate-2-sulfatase is the deficient enzyme in Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II). Patients with Hunter syndrome accumulate heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate.","answers":[{"option":"Aggressive behavior","explanation":"\nHunter syndrome is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in iduronate-2-sulfatase and is associated with aggressive behavior, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, carpal tunnel syndrome, and hepatosplenomegaly.

Patients with Niemann-Pick disease accumulate sphingomyelin, while those with Tay-Sachs disease accumulate GM2 ganglioside. While Niemann-Pick disease is associated with hepatosplenomegaly, which is seen in this patient, Tay-Sachs disease is not. Neither disorder is associated with the coarse facial features, enlarged tongue, or deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Corneal clouding","explanation":"\nHurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type I) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in α-L-iduronidase. Unlike Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II), it is associated with more severe developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and corneal clouding. While it does manifest with coarse facial features, carpal tunnel syndrome, hepatosplenomegaly, and heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate accumulation, it is not associated with the iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Optic atrophy","explanation":"\nOptic atrophy is seen with Krabbe disease (galactocerebrosidase deficiency), in which there is an accumulation of galactocerebroside and psychosine.

Examination shows a mildly tender, 1-cm, hard swelling over the left maxilla. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show a calcium concentration of 8.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase activity of 112 U/L, and parathyroid hormone concentration of 30 pg/mL. Audiometry shows bilateral mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Which of the following processes is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?","difficulty":4,"hint":"Skeletal changes (bony lesions), elevated alkaline phosphatase, and hearing loss with normal serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels are characteristic of Paget disease of the bone.","answers":[{"option":"Increased activity of nuclear factor-κB","explanation":"\nPaget disease of the bone is caused by RANKL-RANK receptor activation, which triggers downstream NF-κB signaling and increases osteoclast activity. To compensate for increased osteoclastic activity, osteoblast activity is also increased. The net result is increased bone turnover with the formation of disorganized (woven) bone, which can cause pathological fractures and/or deformities. Involvement of the cranium can cause headaches, skull enlargement, difficulty chewing (due to dental malocclusion), and mixed hearing loss (due to abnormal ossicles and compression of inner ear structures). Excessive bone turnover also causes an elevation of ALP, as seen in this patient.","bool":true},{"option":"Defective synthesis of dynein","explanation":"Defects in the synthesis of dynein are the underlying cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Although patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia can present with hearing loss, this condition is associated with poor mucociliary clearance that manifests with recurrent sinusitis, bronchiecstasis, and otitis media, none which are present in this patient. Bone involvement or changes in serum ALP levels would not be expected with primary ciliary dyskinesia.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased expression of menin protein","explanation":"Decreased expression of menin protein (a tumor suppressor) is characteristic of MEN 1 syndrome. Patients with MEN1 can develop features of hyperparathyroidism (e.g., increased ALP, bone deformities and brown tumor in severe disease) due to a parathyroid adenoma as well as features of acromegaly (e.g., hearing loss, headache) due to a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma. However, this patient does not have other features characteristic of acromegaly (e.g., coarse facial features, enlarged hands and feet). Also, his normal calcium and PTH levels rule out hyperparathyroidism.","bool":false},{"option":"Defective synthesis of type I collagen","explanation":"Defective synthesis of type 1 collagen is the underlying pathophysiology of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which can cause bony deformities and mixed hearing loss (due to abnormal ossicles and compression of inner ear structures). However, OI would usually present during childhood with features such as pathological fractures, growth retardation, and blue sclera. Furthermore, patients with osteogenesis imperfecta have decreased bone turnover and would therefore have low, rather than high, ALP levels.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased activity of carbonic anhydrase II","explanation":"\nCarbonic anhydrase II is critical for osteoclastic bone resorption. Decreased activity of this enzyme, which is responsible for some forms of osteopetrosis, leads to excessive bone formation without proper bone remodeling. Osteopetrosis can present with elevated ALP levels as well as mixed hearing loss (due to abnormal ossicles and compression of inner ear structures). However, patients with osteopetrosis typically present with diffuse thickening of all bones and pancytopenia (bone marrow failure due to decreased marrow space) beginning in childhood or early adulthood.","bool":false}]},{"id":184,"info":"Human Development","question":"A 21-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus suddenly develops tremors, cold sweats, and confusion while on a backpacking trip with friends.

Her friend administers an intramuscular injection with a substance that reverses her symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of this drug?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The reversal of this patient's symptoms of severe hypoglycemia was achieved by injecting glucagon.","answers":[{"option":"Activation of adenylyl cyclase","explanation":"\nGlucagon binds to the glucagon receptor (a group of Gs protein-coupled receptors), which activates adenylyl cyclase (also known as adenylate cyclase). This activation causes an increase in intracellular cAMP produced from ATP. cAMP activates protein kinase A, which then phosphorylates multiple enzymes, such as glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase. This results in a shift in hepatic cellular metabolism from glucose consumption and storage to glucose production. Therefore, glucagon reverses this patient's insulin-induced hypoglycemia by stimulating gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to increase blood glucose concentration.","bool":true},{"option":"Inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase","explanation":"\nGlycogen phosphorylase is inhibited by insulin signaling via protein phosphatase 1 to promote glycogenesis and inhibit glycogenolysis; therefore, inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase would decrease rather than increase her blood glucose concentration. Instead, glucagon activates rather than inhibits glycogen phosphorylase to promote glycogenolysis.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of α-glucosidase","explanation":"The enzyme α-glucosidase facilitates glucose absorption at the small intestine brush border membrane. Inhibition of α-glucosidase would decrease intestinal sugar absorption, meaning it would decrease rather than increase this patient's blood glucose concentration.","bool":false},{"option":"Activation of glucokinase","explanation":"\nGlucokinase traps glucose molecules inside cells because the phosphorylated glucose it produces cannot be transported across the cell membrane. In doing so, it promotes glycolysis and thus the consumption of glucose. So activation of glucokinase would decrease this patient's blood glucose rather than increase it.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase","explanation":"\nGlucose-6-phosphatase enables glucose generated from glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis to exit the cell by removing the phosphate group from phosphorylated glucose, which cannot be transported across the cell membrane.

The patient's analgesic regimen includes oxycodone, ibuprofen, and alendronic acid. Physical examination shows localized tenderness over the lumbar spine and right hip. His current pain management requires opioid dose escalation. Which of the following opioid side effects is most likely to persist with long-term therapy?","difficulty":1,"hint":"Long-term opioid therapy may lead to opioid tolerance, which diminishes the analgesic effects of opioids over time. Opioid tolerance develops when repeated agonism of the δ-opioid receptor leads to its desensitization so that the receptor can only be activated by greater doses of the agonist (i.e., the opioid). Some of the adverse effects of opioids are also affected by tolerance, while others are not.","answers":[{"option":"Constipation","explanation":"\nConstipation is a common side effect of chronic opioid use and is mediated by both μ-opioid receptor and κ-opioid receptor agonism in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Activation of these receptors in the ENS inhibits peristalsis, increases water absorption, and decreases intestinal secretion. In contrast to other opioid receptors outside the ENS, persistent activation of opioid receptors located in the colonic ENS does not result in desensitization and subsequent tolerance. Therefore, in contrast to other opioid side effects (i.e., sedative, orthostatic, emetic), constipation tends to persist with chronic opioid use. Along with constipation, miosis also remains unaffected by opioid tolerance.","bool":true},{"option":"Mydriasis","explanation":"\nMydriasis is not a typical opioid side effect; however, opioids do usually cause miosis. Miosis is mediated by μ-opioid receptor agonism, a different mechanism than the development of tolerance. Miosis in chronic opioid use is resistant to tolerance.","bool":false},{"option":"Respiratory depression","explanation":"Respiratory depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening side effect of opioid use. It is mediated by δ-opioid receptor agonism, which is the same mechanism through which opioid tolerance develops. However, as patients continue on a consistent and prolonged course of opioids, tolerance develops, and the risk of respiratory depression decreases.","bool":false},{"option":"Pruritus","explanation":"\nPruritus secondary to mast cell activation and histamine release is a common side effect of opioid use. However, as patients continue on a consistent and prolonged course of opioids, tolerance develops and the risk of pruritus decreases.","bool":false},{"option":"Nausea","explanation":"\nNausea is a common side effect of opioid use.

Neuraminidase inhibitors, e.g., oseltamivir and zanamivir, inhibit budding and release of the progeny influenza virus and can be used for both treatment and prevention of disease. Early initiation of treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) can shorten the duration of disease.","bool":true},{"option":"Inhibition of proton translocation","explanation":"Inhibition of proton translocation (via the M2 ion channel) from the cytoplasm of infected cells to the inside of the influenza virus is the mechanism of action of amantadine and rimantadine. These agents prevent viral replication by inhibiting uncoating within the infected cell. However, this class of drugs is no longer used to treat influenza because they are associated with increased viral drug resistance.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of DNA polymerase","explanation":"Inhibition of viral DNA polymerase is the mechanism of action of guanosine analogs (e.g., acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir), as well as foscarnet and cidofovir. Guanosine analogs are phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase and incorporated into the viral DNA. This incorporation leads to inhibition of DNA polymerase and termination of DNA synthesis. These agents are primarily used for treatment of HSV infection and varicella zoster infection, not for treatment of influenza.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of nucleoside reverse transcriptase","explanation":"Inhibition of nucleoside reverse transcriptase is the mechanism of action of NRTIs (e.g., zidovudine). These agents competitively inhibit nucleotide binding to reverse transcriptase, which results in termination of the DNA synthesis required for viral replication.
