She started a combined oral contraceptive for dysmenorrhea and acne six months ago. She has been taking the medication consistently and experiences withdrawal bleeding on the 4th week of each pill pack. Her acne and dysmenorrhea have improved significantly. The patient increased her daily exercise regimen to 60 minutes of running and weight training three months ago. She started college six months ago. She has not had any changes in her sleep or energy levels. She is 162 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lbs); six months ago she weighed 57 kg (126 lbs). Examination shows clear skin and no other abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Consider the causes of this patient's weight gain.","answers":[{"option":"Reassure the patient","explanation":"This woman started gaining weight around the time she started treatment with combined oral contraceptives (COC) but, despite popular belief, weight gain has not been proven to be a side effect of COC. Since the patient also started college 6 months ago and has recently intensified her training routine, her weight gain is most likely attributable to changes in eating habits and an increase in muscle mass. As the current treatment has also proven to be beneficial for her previous dysmenorrhea and acne, reassurance and advice on maintaining a healthy weight are the most appropriate steps in management.","bool":true},{"option":"Switch contraceptive to a progestin-only pill","explanation":"\nProgestin-only contraceptive pills are indicated in women who have contraindications to treatment with estrogen-containing combined oral contraceptives. Contraindications include estrogen-dependent and hepatic tumors, an increased risk for thromboembolic events and cardiovascular disease, cigarette smoking, acute pancreatitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Since this patient has no known contraindications to estrogen-containing treatment and is tolerating her current medication well, a change in treatment is not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Switch contraceptive to a nonhormonal contraceptive method","explanation":"Switching from hormonal contraceptive methods to nonhormonal contraceptive methods is indicated in women who experience side effects or have contraindications to combined hormonal contraception (e.g., development of hepatic adenoma, increased risk of thromboembolism, estrogen-dependent tumor). Since this woman's dysmenorrhea and acne have improved since starting treatment with combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and there is no evidence that weight gain is a side effect of COCs, there is no indication to change her treatment regimen.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform a pelvic ultrasound","explanation":"A pelvic ultrasound is performed to confirm pregnancy. Although weight gain is a symptom of pregnancy, pregnancy is unlikely since she consistently takes oral contraceptives, menstruates regularly, and her urine pregnancy test is negative.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Measure serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration","explanation":"Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are measured to diagnose thyroid disorders, such as hypothyroidism. Individuals with hypothyroidism often present with symptoms of decreased metabolic rate, including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and secondary amenorrhea. In the absence of any other typical features of hypothyroidism, this woman's weight gain is more likely due to other causes.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test","explanation":"A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to diagnose elevated cortisol levels in individuals with Cushing's syndrome. Common clinical features include hypertension, central obesity, moon facies, easily bruisable skin and acne, muscle atrophy, and features of virilization in women (hirsutism, menstrual cycle irregularities). Since this woman's weight gain did not occur simultaneously with her other symptoms and she does not have hypertension, Cushing's syndrome is unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Measure serum testosterone concentration","explanation":"Serum testosterone levels are measured in women with suspected polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and polycystic ovaries. Typical clinical features include menstrual irregularities (e.g., amenorrhea), infertility, hirsutism, obesity, and acne. Although PCOS causes acne, and the condition may also improve with combined oral contraceptive treatment, she had no other features suggestive of PCOS and only started gaining weight after treatment, which makes this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false}]},{"id":1,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"\nA 34-year-old woman comes to the physician requesting prenatal care.

Without treatment, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient is obese and has acne, oligomenorrhea, and hirsutism, which are findings consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).","answers":[{"option":"Endometrial carcinoma","explanation":"Patients with PCOS are at increased risk for endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial adenocarcinoma due to unopposed estrogen exposure. In PCOS, peripheral insulin resistance causes hyperinsulinemia, which increases androgen production from theca cells and estrogen conversion from granulosa cells. Increased androgen levels inhibit the production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver, which further increases circulating estrogen levels.\nPCOS is a common cause of infertility, due to disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to increased LH secretion, impaired follicle maturation, and anovulation.","bool":true},{"option":"Cervical carcinoma","explanation":"\nCervical carcinoma is associated with infection with high-risk strains of HPV (e.g., HPV 16, 18, 31, 33). Other risk factors for cervical carcinoma include early onset of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, multiple pregnancies, immunosuppression, previous sexually transmitted diseases, and smoking. PCOS is not considered a risk factor for cervical carcinoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Mature cystic teratoma","explanation":"Mature cystic teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumors. They are usually well differentiated, benign, and can contain any type of tissue (e.g., hair, teeth, and sebaceous glands). Mature cystic teratomas are not associated with PCOS.","bool":false},{"option":"Choriocarcinoma","explanation":"\nChoriocarcinoma requires implantation of a fertilized egg, and can develop during or after a pregnancy. Most cases of choriocarcinoma are preceded by molar pregnancy. Patients with PCOS are usually anovulatory and have decreased fertility, which decreases the risk of choriocarcinoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Endometrioma","explanation":"\nEndometriomas (chocolate cysts) are caused by endometriosis, which occurs when endometrial tissue develops outside the uterus.

She has not had any nipple discharge. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals with normal flow; her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses condoms consistently. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She drinks 2–4 glasses of wine on weekends; she does not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her maternal grandmother developed aortic valve stenosis in her mid-70s; her family history is otherwise noncontributary. The patient is 183 cm (6 ft) tall and weighs 79 kg (175 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Inspection of the breast shows no visible skin changes or nipple abnormalities. There is mild tenderness in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast but no masses are felt on palpation. There is no lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination, including cardiopulmonary examination, shows no abnormalities. ECG shows a regular sinus rhythm and no acute abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient presents with focal noncyclical mastalgia.","answers":[{"option":"Ultrasonography of the breast","explanation":"\nNoncyclical mastalgia most commonly affects women 30–50 years of age and is often related to internal breast changes, previous surgeries, injuries, infections, or other breast pathologies (e.g., fibroadenomas, cysts). All patients with noncyclical mastalgia should receive diagnostic imaging to screen for breast cancer because of the rare association with malignancy. Ultrasonography is typically used to screen for breast cancer in patients &lt; 30 years of age because women in this age group typically have increased breast tissue density. Ultrasound increases the sensitivity of mammography if used in tandem. After malignancy is ruled out, conservative therapy may be employed and includes hot and cold compresses, topical/oral analgesics as necessary, dietary modifications (e.g., reducing caffeine and high-fat foods), and the use of a well-fitting bra. (See “Overview of mastalgia” table).\nTamoxifen may be prescribed to patients whose symptoms do not resolve within 6 months of conservative treatment.","bool":true},{"option":"Mammography","explanation":"In rare cases, noncyclical mastalgia occurs in the setting of malignancy. Therefore, all patients with noncyclical mastalgia should be screened for breast cancer. While mammography is the gold standard for breast cancer screening in patients &gt; 30 years of age, another imaging modality is preferred in patients &lt; 30 years because breast tissue density is typically increased in this population.","bool":false},{"option":"Reassurance and topical diclofenac therapy","explanation":"Reassurance and conservative management, such as hot and cold compresses, topical/oral analgesics (e.g., diclofenac) as necessary, dietary modifications (e.g., reducing caffeine and high-fat foods), and the use of a well-fitting bra, is appropriate in patients with cyclical mastalgia, diffuse noncyclical mastalgia, or extramammary mastalgia due to a musculoskeletal etiology. However, reassurance and conservative therapy in a patient with focal noncyclical mastalgia would not be appropriate.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral duloxetine therapy","explanation":"Oral serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., duloxetine) can be used in the management of fibromyalgia which typically manifests in female patients between 20–50 years of age who present with symptoms of focal pain and difficulty concentrating. However, fibromyalgia typically manifests with at least 7 of the 19 identified widespread pain index tenderpoints.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral contraceptive therapy","explanation":"While cyclical mastalgia is a consequence of the hormonal fluctuations associated with menstrual cycles, the use of oral contraceptive therapy (OCP) is not used to treat breast pain associated with cyclical mastalgia.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\n","difficulty":1,"hint":"Diffuse, bilateral breast pain that occurs at regular intervals is consistent with cyclical mastalgia.","answers":[{"option":"Provide reassurance and prescribe oral ibuprofen","explanation":"\nCyclical mastalgia is typically caused by hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. The initial step in the management of cyclical mastalgia is to provide reassurance (to reduce patient anxiety about a potential malignancy), provide topical or oral analgesics (e.g., diclofenac gel, oral ibuprofen or acetaminophen), and recommend supportive measures such as cold or warm compresses and support garments (e.g., well-fitting, soft bras). For patients who are on oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, discontinuing or reducing the dose of these medications can be trialed. Breast imaging (ultrasound or mammography) is not routinely indicated in cyclical mastalgia. In patients with severe cyclical mastalgia that persists after 6 months of first-line therapy, tamoxifen should be considered as a second-line treatment.\nSee “Overview of mastalgia” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Prescribe oral tamoxifen","explanation":"Oral tamoxifen is the preferred second-line therapy for cyclical mastalgia and should be considered if breast pain persists after 6 months of first-line treatment.

This patient has a normal clinical breast examination and cyclical mastalgia, for which breast imaging is not routinely indicated. Furthermore, for a patient &lt; 30 years of age, ultrasound, rather than mammography, is the preferred modality for breast imaging as the higher breast tissue density makes detection of breast abnormalities with mammography more difficult.\nMammography is also indicated for routine breast cancer screening but in the absence of significant risk factors for breast cancer (e.g., positive family history), screening starts at 40 years of age, at the earliest.","bool":false},{"option":"Prescribe combined oral contraceptives","explanation":"Reducing the dose of or discontinuing, rather than starting, combined oral contraceptives (COCPs) can be trialed in patients with cyclical mastalgia. Some patients experience symptom relief after reducing the dose of estrogen.","bool":false},{"option":"Recommend rest and heat application","explanation":"Rest and heat application can be effective for the treatment of extramammary musculoskeletal chest pain. This patient plays sports regularly, which can cause musculoskeletal injuries. However, extramammary chest pain does not typically follow a cyclical pattern and usually does not affect both sides equally.

Other common physical findings in patients with IBC include blood-tinged nipple discharge and a palpable mass. For patients with clinical findings of IBC, a core needle biopsy is indicated to support the diagnosis, and if invasive carcinoma is found, a full-thickness skin biopsy (punch biopsy) should be obtained. Diagnosis is confirmed if punch biopsy shows infiltration of the dermal lymphatics. IBC is a rare but aggressive carcinoma, and most patients have metastatic disease at the time of initial presentation.","bool":true},{"option":"Mastitis","explanation":"\nMastitis manifests with tenderness, warmth, erythema, and edema of the affected breast, as well as reactive lymphadenopathy, all of which are seen in this patient.

Examination shows a nontender, firm, hard mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Mammography shows large, dense breasts, with a 1.7-cm mass in the right upper outer quadrant. The patient undergoes right upper outer quadrant lumpectomy with subsequent sentinel node biopsy, which reveals moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma and micrometastasis to one axillary lymph node. There is no evidence of extranodal metastasis. The tumor tests positive for both estrogen and progesterone receptors and does not show human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) over-expression.

GnRH agonists can reduce the size of leiomyomas by inducing hypoestrogenism and hypoprogesteronism. A reduction in the size of a leiomyomatous uterus decreases surgical time, speeds up postoperative recovery, and may even enable a vaginal hysterectomy (which typically causes less blood loss than an abdominal hysterectomy). GnRH agonists also treat menorrhagia by inducing amenorrhea, which improves hemoglobin levels before surgery.","bool":true},{"option":"Estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills","explanation":"\nCombined oral contraceptive therapy (estrogen-progestin pills) is effective in reducing menstrual blood flow and may decrease the incidence of leiomyomas.

The granulosa cells release a number of vasoactive mediators, most importantly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF increases the capillary permeability and leads to third spacing, which can manifest with enlargement of the ovaries, ascites, and weight gain. Mild to moderate OHSS, as seen here, typically develops 3–7 days after the administration of the ovulatory dose of hCG. Severe OHSS usually has a later onset and can lead to pleural effusion, acute kidney injury, thromboembolism, and sepsis.\nMild to moderate OHSS can be managed on an outpatient basis, with limited physical activity, hydration (1–2 L/day), acetaminophen, and daily monitoring of body weight and urine output.

The condition is most likely caused by an increased production of endometrial prostaglandin (PG) F2α. PGF2α causes dysrhythmic uterine contractions and consequently abdominal pain and uterine ischemia (which leads to endometrial sloughing). The accompanying symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea (e.g., headache, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea) are also believed to be mediated by PGF2α. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen are the first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea since they inhibit PG synthesis.

Luteomas are rare, but they are more likely than malignant ovarian neoplasms in pregnancy.","answers":[{"option":"Close observation","explanation":"\nLuteomas are rare benign tumors that develop from androgen-producing lutein cells. Although the majority of patients are asymptomatic, luteoma can manifest with features of virilization, such as deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly, as seen in this patient. These tumors typically regress spontaneously post partum. Larger luteomas are associated with increased mass effect and torsion and can lead to secondary hemorrhage. Expectant management and close observation are, therefore, indicated in patients with virilization during pregnancy and ultrasound findings consistent with luteoma. Surgery is sometimes performed to limit further virilization (both maternal and fetal), signs of which are typically irreversible, and in patients with tumors &gt; 5 cm to prevent ovarian torsion. Urgent surgery is indicated in patients with features of ovarian torsion and/or mass-related symptoms.\nIn patients with a history and ultrasound findings that are concerning for ovarian malignancy (e.g., rapidly progressive clinical features; solid, solitary, usually unilateral mass on pelvic ultrasound), early aggressive management (e.g., surgery) may be indicated. Other causes of virilization during pregnancy include placental aromatase deficiency, adrenal malignancies, and external androgen uptake. None of these conditions is associated with ovarian masses on ultrasound.","bool":true},{"option":"Measurement of serum CEA concentration","explanation":"\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a nonspecific tumor marker and increased serum CEA concentrations can be seen in association with colorectal cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, breast cancer, and several other malignancies.

These findings indicate uncomplicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.","answers":[{"option":"Addition of doxylamine","explanation":"If vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) alone does not improve nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, doxylamine should be administered. Dietary changes (e.g., cutting out spicy, high-fat, and/or acidic foods) and avoidance of triggers (e.g., poorly ventilated rooms, loud noises, strong and/or unpleasant odors) may also improve nausea. If treatment with pyridoxine and doxylamine is unsuccessful, antiemetics such as dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, or promethazine can be administered.\nIn patients with severe dehydration and metabolic alkalosis (due to frequent vomiting), IV rehydration with electrolyte supplementation should be initiated. Chlorpromazine and methylprednisolone should be used with caution and only in patients who have not responded to other treatments.","bool":true},{"option":"Scheduled meal times","explanation":"Scheduled meal times every one to two hours with small amounts of food may help to improve symptoms, since a very full or empty stomach can trigger nausea.

If BRCA is mutated and dsDNA breaks are not repaired, other DNA mutations can occur that increase the risk of cancer. Thus, BRCA is a tumor suppressor gene. As with other tumor suppressor genes, both alleles must have loss of function for the risk of cancer to be significantly increased. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion.","bool":true},{"option":"Arrest of cell cycle in G1 phase","explanation":"The transition from G1 to S phases (= DNA replication) of a cell cycle is regulated by multiple checkpoint regulator proteins. Mutation or damage of these regulator protein's genes that make the proteins dysfunctional or deficient would allow unregulated cell growth and thereby promote cancer development; thus, these genes are considered tumor suppressor genes. Some well-known examples include p53 protein (mutation associated with many cancers), Rb protein (mutation causes retinoblastoma), and cyclin-dependent kinase 2A (mutation causes melanoma). However, though BRCA genes are also tumor suppressor genes, they prevent cancer via a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Regulation of intercellular adhesion","explanation":"\nGenes that code for proteins responsible for regulation of intercellular adhesion and subsequent cell-signaling prevent tumor invasion and metastasis; thus, these genes are considered tumor suppressor genes. A well-known example is the APC gene; in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a mutation in the APC gene leads to an erroneous regulation of the beta-catenin and Wnt signaling pathway, which leads to colorectal cancer in 100% of the affected patients. However, though BRCA genes are also tumor suppressor genes, they prevent cancer via a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Activity of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase","explanation":"The pathologic activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase genes, such as the BCR-ABL fusion gene, leads to uncontrolled downstream signaling that can cause uninhibited proliferation of tissue and promote carcinogenesis; thus, these genes are considered oncogenes, and only one allele needs to be mutated to increase the risk of cancer. Breast cancer can show mutations of tyrosine kinase Her2/neu. But tyrosine kinase Her2/neu belongs to the epithelial growth factor receptor family and is not a cytoplasmic (non-receptor) tyrosine kinase. BRCA tumor suppressor genes have no influence on tyrosine kinases.","bool":false},{"option":"Transcription of genes that induce cell proliferation","explanation":"Mutations in genes that cause pathologic activation of transcription factors leads to uncontrolled transcription of proliferative genes, which in turn causes uncontrolled growth of tissue and promotes carcinogenesis; thus, these genes are considered oncogenes, and only one allele needs to be mutated to increase the risk of cancer. Well-known examples of transcription factor mutations include those of the myc family: L-myc in small cell lung cancer, N-myc in neuroblastoma, and c-myc in Burkitt lymphoma. The BRCA gene does not encode for a transcription factor.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of programmed cell death","explanation":"Disruptions in apoptosis of damaged or faulty cells causes immortality of neoplastic tissue and thus promote cancer development. For cancer to develop, pro-apoptotic molecules need to be deactivated, whereas anti-apoptotic molecules would need to be pathologically activated. For example, the BCL-2 gene is an anti-apoptotic molecule that, if mutated, causes a wrongful inhibition of apoptosis, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of B cells and potentially to follicular or diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

Serum concentrations of FSH, LH, and prolactin are typically within the reference ranges. AS is usually asymptomatic; the standard treatment for symptomatic AS is hysteroscopic resection of the adhesions.\nThe workup of secondary amenorrhea includes a progestin and/or an estrogen/progestin withdrawal test, which induces withdrawal bleeding in patients with anovulatory cycles (e.g., due to polycystic ovary syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency). Because of the presence of intrauterine adhesions and blocked outflow tract, these tests do not cause bleeding in patients with AS.","bool":true},{"option":"MRI of the brain","explanation":"\nMRI of the brain is the preferred imaging modality to confirm Sheehan syndrome (SS).

Estriol is instead used to monitor fetal well-being; a low level of estriol during the second trimester can indicate congenital defects such as Down syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Thyrotropin","explanation":"\nThyrotropin (TSH) levels are used to diagnose thyroid disorders. Hyperthyroidism can manifest with amenorrhea. A TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, which is a cause of secondary hyperthyroidism, can also cause nausea and increased urinary frequency due to damage to the posterior pituitary gland. However, neither hyperthyroidism nor pituitary damage would cause breast tenderness. Instead, other features would be expected, such as heat intolerance, diaphoresis, insomnia, and restlessness, none of which are seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Luteinizing hormone","explanation":"In a patient with primary amenorrhea, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels are measured to differentiate hypogonadotropic hypogonadism from hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and to diagnose androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Female adolescents engaged in athletic activities can develop a functional hypothalamic disturbance (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) but in adolescent hypogonadism, breast and pubic hair development would also be delayed. Complete AIS would result in breast development that is appropriate for age, as seen here, but patients with complete AIS would not develop pubic hair. LH levels are not used to diagnose pregnancy.","bool":false},{"option":"Prolactin","explanation":"A serum prolactin assay would be used to diagnose prolactinomas (hyperprolactinemia), which can cause amenorrhea due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and increased urinary frequency due to compression of the posterior pituitary gland (central diabetes insipidus). However, adolescent females with hyperprolactinemia would also have impaired development of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., breasts, pubic hair), and they would typically report galactorrhea rather than breast tenderness. Prolactin, which only begins to rise by the 8th– 9th weeks of gestation, has a low sensitivity and specificity for the early diagnosis of pregnancy.","bool":false}]},{"id":35,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of vaginal discharge for 3 days.

Physical exam shows thin grayish-white vaginal discharge. There is no erythema of the vaginal mucosa. The pH of the discharge is 5.9. Adding potassium hydroxide (KOH) to a mount containing vaginal discharge produces a fishy odor. Further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is most likely to show which of the following findings?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Clue cells are an important histological finding for this patient's condition.","answers":[{"option":"Gram-variable rod","explanation":"\nGardnerella vaginalis is a pleomorphic, gram-variable rod that causes bacterial vaginosis, which is consistent with this patient's findings of characteristic thin grayish-white vaginal discharge with a pH &gt; 4.5 that has a fishy odor when KOH is added (positive whiff-amine test). The absence of vaginal pain or erythema further supports this diagnosis. Bacterial vaginosis typically develops when the pH of the vagina rises above 4.5, which allows G. vaginalis to multiply and results in the characteristic malodorous vaginal discharge. Predisposing factors include a shift in vaginal flora (e.g., douching decreases Lactobacillus that maintain vaginal pH between 3.8 and 4.5), the release of amines from increased bacterial degradation of proteins, and/or increased sexual activity (as the pH of semen is between 7.2 and 7.8).","bool":true},{"option":"Flagellated protozoa","explanation":"\nTrichomonas vaginalis is an anaerobic, motile, and flagellated protozoan that causes trichomoniasis. Trichomoniasis presents with foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge with a pH &gt; 4.5. Although this patient has malodorous vaginal discharge with increased vaginal pH, the vaginal discharge associated with trichomoniasis has different characteristics than that of this patient. Furthermore, the wet mount would show motile, flagellated organisms in trichomoniasis.","bool":false},{"option":"Pseudohyphae","explanation":"\nPseudohyphae are a morphological growth form of yeast. When associated with gynecological complaints, pseudohyphae typically refer to Candida albicans, which causes vulvovaginal candidiasis. The main features of vulvovaginal candidiasis are dyspareunia, vaginal pruritus, and odorless vaginal discharge resembling cottage cheese with normal pH (4–4.5). This patient is unlikely to have vaginal candidiasis because her discharge is grayish-white and malodorous, and she has an increased pH.","bool":false},{"option":"Gram-negative diplococci","explanation":"\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus that causes gonorrhea, a common sexually transmitted disease.

This patient has experienced only 7 months of amenorrhea while taking a combined oral contraceptive pill. To accurately determine whether menopause has been reached, patients need to assess whether amenorrhea persists following the discontinuation of oral contraceptives.

In these patients, menopause is confirmed with a serum FSH level at least 4 weeks after stopping hormonal contraception.","bool":true},{"option":"Reassure the patient that contraception can be discontinued because menopause has occurred","explanation":"\nMenopause cannot be diagnosed in patients, like this one, who are taking combined oral contraceptives (OCPs). Therefore, it is inappropriate to tell this patient that menopause has occurred. It would be reasonable to stop oral contraceptives to assess for the return of menses and the presence of perimenopausal symptoms. Patients should be counseled about the risk of pregnancy before stopping OCPs.","bool":false},{"option":"Recommend that the patient's hormone levels are measured to confirm menopause","explanation":"Measuring serum hormone levels, e.g., follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), is an ineffective test for menopause in patients currently taking oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Because OCPs reversibly suppress gonadotropic hormones, endogenous hormone levels will always be low in a patient taking OCPs. It is, therefore, not possible to diagnose menopause in this patient who has only experienced 7 months of amenorrhea while also taking OCPs. In certain patients with underlying disorders that cause irregular menses, menopause can be confirmed by measuring serum FSH levels at least 4 weeks after stopping hormonal contraception.","bool":false},{"option":"Advise the patient that menses will likely return after contraception is discontinued","explanation":"It is not possible to know whether this patient's menses will return after discontinuing oral contraceptives. While it is possible that she is still able to menstruate at 45 years of age, her age and family history of early menopause are risk factors for ovarian failure.

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient presents with oligomenorrhea and symptoms of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne vulgaris). These features together with obesity and decreased insulin sensitivity (as evidenced by elevated blood glucose levels) suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).","answers":[{"option":"Combination oral contraceptives","explanation":"A combination oral contraceptive pill (COCP) containing ethinylestradiol and progestin is the first-line pharmacotherapy for patients with PCOS who currently do not wish to conceive. COCPs help regulate the menstrual cycle and, because of antiandrogenic effects, relieve symptoms of hyperandrogenism. In addition, progestin decreases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, which are possible complications of PCOS (due to the increased levels of estrogen from aromatization of androgens). Besides pharmacotherapy, weight loss is the mainstay of treatment because obesity and the associated insulin resistance play an important role in the pathophysiology of PCOS.\nMetformin may be used as an add-on to COCPs and lifestyle modifications to address metabolic comorbidities (e.g., impaired insulin sensitivity). Monotherapy with metformin may be considered as a second-line treatment for menstrual irregularity in patients unable to take or tolerate COCPs.","bool":true},{"option":"Clomiphene citrate","explanation":"\nClomiphene citrate is a first-line pharmacotherapy in patients with PCOS who have a desire to conceive. This medication increases the secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, thereby stimulating ovulation. Although infertility due to oligoovulation or anovulation is one of the main concerns in patients with PCOS, this young woman currently has no desire to get pregnant, which is why pharmacotherapy should focus on relieving symptoms instead.","bool":false},{"option":"Letrozole","explanation":"\nLetrozole is a first-line treatment for women with PCOS who wish to conceive. This medication decreases estrogen levels, which are increased in patients with PCOS due to increased aromatization of androgens.

Decreased insulin sensitivity leads to hyperinsulinism, which exacerbates hyperandrogenism as a result of increased ovarian androgen production, decreased sex hormone-binding globulin, and the resulting increase in free testosterone. Since insulin therapy would further increase the patient's insulin levels and worsen insulin resistance rather than decrease it, it is not beneficial in the treatment of PCOS.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Leuprolide","explanation":"\nGonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, such as leuprolide, can suppress or stimulate the release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, depending on the manner of administration (i.e., continuous or pulsatile). While the pulsatile use of leuprolide is indicated for certain causes of infertility, it is not indicated in PCOS. Continuous administration of GnRH agonists may be used to suppress androgen production in patients with PCOS. However, additional therapy with estrogen and progestin is necessary to prevent symptoms of premature ovarian failure, making these drugs a costly and complicated treatment option that is not routinely indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Danazol","explanation":"\nDanazol is an androgen agonist used in patients with endometriosis or fibrocystic breast disease because of its antigonadotropic (decreasing luteinizing hormone levels and follicle-stimulating hormone levels) and antiestrogenic effects. In PCOS, however, androgen levels are typically increased, which is why antiandrogens (e.g., spironolactone) rather than androgen agonists are used to improve symptoms of hyperandrogenism if the first-line treatment is contraindicated or does not yield the desired effects.","bool":false},{"option":"Metformin","explanation":"\nMetformin is used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus and is initiated at the time of diagnosis in addition to lifestyle modifications for weight loss. In patients without symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., polyuria), diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus requires ≥ 2 abnormal test results for hyperglycemia. A single random elevated plasma glucose measurement of 190 mg/dL is insufficient for the diagnosis in asymptomatic patients and further workup is required before prescribing metformin for glycemic control.\nIn addition, metformin is used in patients with PCOS and decreased insulin sensitivity to improve menstrual irregularities, metabolic outcomes, and weight loss. However, metformin monotherapy is only used in PCOS as a second-line treatment for menstrual irregularities in patients with contraindications for the first-line options, which this patient does not have.

Progesterone is administered for 10 days, after which the patient is observed for withdrawal bleeding. Progesterone withdrawal bleeding confirms that the patient has normal estrogen levels (which leads to the proliferation of the endometrium) and that anovulation is the cause of secondary amenorrhea (anovulation leads to absent corpus luteum, which would otherwise produce progesterone). The absence of withdrawal bleeding suggests hypoestrogenism (due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or primary ovarian failure) or uterine obstruction. In such cases, a combined estrogen and progesterone challenge should be performed.

Ectopic pregnancy should be suspected in patients with amenorrhea, enlarged uterus, and lower abdominal pain, with or without vaginal bleeding. Endometrial biopsy is not performed routinely in suspected ectopic pregnancy, but shows decidualization with no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy (no chorionic villi). Ectopic pregnancies have the potential to rupture and cause hemorrhagic shock.\nRisk factors for ectopic pregnancy include prior ectopic pregnancy, history of infertility, PID, acute appendicitis, prior tubal surgery, smoking, and advanced maternal age.","bool":true},{"option":"Ectopic endometrial tissue","explanation":"\nEctopic endometrial tissue is characteristic of endometriosis. Although abdominal pain is a common feature of endometriosis, it is usually chronic and associated with menses.

Anovulation leads to a deficit in progesterone production, while unopposed estrogen continues to cause abnormal growth of the endometrial lining and vessels. If increasing estrogen levels trigger negative feedback in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, a drop in FSH/LH and estrogen levels leads to a sudden loss of endometrium that can cause heavy and prolonged bleeding.

Although hypothyroidism is also a potential cause of amenorrhea that should certainly be considered, this patient has no other symptoms that would suggest this underlying condition (e.g., weight gain, fatigue, cold intolerance). Although hypothyroidism is not the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea, TSH levels should be measured in all women with secondary amenorrhea to rule out this condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased prolactin secretion","explanation":"Increased prolactin secretion is found in patients with a pituitary prolactinoma. The condition can also cause secondary amenorrhea, which is also seen in this patient, sometimes in conjunction with galactorrhea.

While patients with this condition will ultimately also develop secondary amenorrhea, they initially have intermittent ovulatory cycles and therefore irregular menstrual periods. In addition, patients often present with typical symptoms of estrogen deficiency such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Furthermore, the condition more frequently occurs after the age of 30.","bool":false},{"option":"Intrauterine adhesions","explanation":"\nIntrauterine adhesions are the cause of Asherman syndrome. The adhesions prevent the normal cycle of endometrial growth and shedding and can block the uterus, causing secondary amenorrhea.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient's monthly episodes of back and pelvic pain and diarrhea are most likely related to her menstrual cycle.","answers":[{"option":"Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity","explanation":"\nEndometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, intestines, and/or bladder. Like endometrium within the uterine cavity, endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity reacts to the hormone cycle by proliferating under the influence of estrogen. Patients typically present with symptoms that coincide with their menstrual cycle. Symptoms depend on the location of the endometrial tissue. Given this patient's diarrhea, rectovaginal endometriosis is most likely.\nPatients with endometriosis are usually treated with NSAIDs and continuous hormonal contraceptives. NSAIDs can be used alone if pregnancy is desired. In severe cases, GnRH agonists and estrogen-progestin OCPs may be indicated.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone","explanation":"Decreased secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) can be caused by hypothalamic dysfunction resulting from surgery, infarction, or tumor. Decreased GnRH secretion results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Patients present with amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles due to low levels of FSH and LH. However, this woman continues to have regular menstrual cycles.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium","explanation":"\nLeiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas are smooth muscle tumors of the uterus that are usually small and asymptomatic. If symptoms do occur, they depend on the size and location of the tumor and can include abnormal menstruation. For example, a tumor located directly under the endometrium can cause hypermenorrhea secondary to a greater surface area. Leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas are usually not associated with diarrhea. Lastly, symptomatic leiomyomas/leiomyosarcomas are usually evident on a hysterosalpingogram.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased secretion of androgens and luteinizing hormone","explanation":"Increased androgen secretion and elevated luteinizing hormone are characteristics of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient's anal fissures, constipation, and severely itchy thin, white plaques in the vulva and perianal region are consistent with anogenital lichen sclerosus.","answers":[{"option":"Prescribe topical corticosteroids","explanation":"The initial treatment of anogenital lichen sclerosus in both children and adults consists of patient education on vaginal hygiene and scratching cessation as well as pharmacological treatment with a superpotent topical corticosteroid, such as clobetasol. To prevent long-term sequelae, initial treatment can be followed up with local maintenance therapy (either with topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors). In adults, a punch biopsy of the lesions is recommended before initiating therapy to rule out dysplastic changes or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In pediatric patients, the diagnosis is usually clinical. Nonetheless, pediatric patients and their parents should be educated on the association between lichen sclerosus and SCC and advised to regularly examine the anogenital skin for cancerous lesions.","bool":true},{"option":"Prescribe topical clotrimazole","explanation":"Topical clotrimazole therapy is indicated in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis, which typically manifests with pruritus and erythema of the vulva and vagina.

They have initially attempted to engage in intercourse at least twice a week after they got married 6 months ago, but are now only attempting intercourse every other week. During attempted vaginal penetration, the patient has discomfort and her pelvic floor muscles tighten up. The husband reports that recently he has had difficulties maintaining an erection during sexual activity, which he attributes to “not trying to hurt her.” Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and usually last 5 days with heavy flow. Three years ago, the patient was diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder for which she undergoes cognitive behavioral therapy. There is no family history of serious illness. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a normal-appearing vulva without redness or tenderness; there is no vaginal discharge.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The best initial management of this patient's condition is pelvic floor physical therapy.","answers":[{"option":"Genito-pelvic pain disorder","explanation":"This patient's symptoms are suggestive of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, a psychosexual condition that is characterized by persistent or recurrent difficulties during sexual intercourse. Characteristic symptoms include difficulty with vaginal penetration, vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during intercourse, anticipatory anxiety, and pronounced tightening of the pelvic floor muscles (historically referred to as vaginismus) during attempted vaginal penetration. The disorder often manifests in individuals with relationship issues (e.g., sexual problems also present in the partner), poor body image (e.g., body dysmorphic disorder), and psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety).","bool":true},{"option":"Vulvodynia","explanation":"Women affected by vulvodynia experience soreness and burning of the vulva that may be present continuously or triggered by touch or pressure (e.g., sexual intercourse, tampon use). The combination of discomfort and tightening of pelvic floor muscles on penetration experienced by this patient is not consistent with vulvodynia.","bool":false},{"option":"Inadequate lubrication","explanation":"Inadequate vaginal lubrication can have a number of reasons, including female sexual arousal disorder, hormonal changes (e.g., menopause), nerve injury (e.g., multiple sclerosis, diabetic peripheral neuropathy), and medication intake (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). This patient's examination findings indicate that the vaginal discomfort and pelvic floor tightening are independent of possible discomfort secondary to dryness and inadequate lubrication. This patient's outer genital examination also does not indicate any signs of dryness or irritation, which are common if inadequate vaginal secretion is present. Additionally, she has neither associated features of sexual arousal disorder (e.g., no absent interest or participation in sexual activity) nor a history of illness or medication intake.","bool":false},{"option":"Bladder pain syndrome","explanation":"Patients with bladder pain syndrome experience suprapubic pain or discomfort that is relieved by voiding as well as urinary urgency and frequency over a period of at least 6 weeks. While the suprapubic pain may be exacerbated by sexual activity, painful bladder syndrome does not cause vaginal pain or impede penetration and can be ruled out in a patient without urinary symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Vulvovaginitis","explanation":"While most types of vulvovaginitis manifest with soreness, dryness, and a burning sensation, particularly following sexual intercourse, infectious vulvovaginitis shows further features like vaginal discharge or odor. Since this patient has neither a history of infection (e.g., vaginal discharge) nor complaints of vaginal dryness or pruritus, this diagnosis can be ruled out.","bool":false},{"option":"Endometriosis","explanation":"\nEndometriosis manifests with dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and infertility.

Initially, the expressed milk is thick and yellowish. Three days later, the mother's breasts swell and the expressed milk becomes thinner and whiter. A decrease in maternal serum concentration of which of the following is most likely responsible for the observed changes in milk production?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This hormone physiologically stimulates the endometrium to develop a secretory lining during the menstrual cycle.","answers":[{"option":"Progesterone","explanation":"\nLactogenesis is the process of milk production during pregnancy and is comprised of two stages: secretory initiation (stage I) and secretory activation (stage II). Secretory initiation occurs during the second half of pregnancy, when high levels of circulating progesterone directly inhibit prolactin-induced milk production. Delivery of the placenta causes a rapid decline in progesterone. This decline triggers secretion of high levels of prolactin, cortisol, and insulin, which propel the second stage of lactogenesis. Secretory activation usually occurs on the second or third day post-partum and is marked by breast swelling and copious milk production.\nOccasionally, retained pieces of placenta may result in difficulty with lactation due to the ongoing production of progesterone.","bool":true},{"option":"Estrogen","explanation":"Levels of estrogen rise gradually during pregnancy and are required for differentiation and growth of the uterus, breast tissue, and the mammary glands. High circulating levels of estrogen contribute to the suppression of milk production during late pregnancy. Although levels of estrogen decline in the postpartum period, this is not the primary mechanism responsible for the observed changes in milk production.","bool":false},{"option":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","explanation":"Following implantation, the cells of the syncytiotrophoblasts produce hCG, which is one of the earliest signs that implantation has occurred. This hormone plays a crucial role during early pregnancy, as it triggers the corpus luteum to continue secretion of progesterone until the placenta takes over at around 8–12 weeks' gestation. The level of hCG rises rapidly during the first trimester and gradually declines after that. It has no functional role in lactogenesis.","bool":false},{"option":"Oxytocin","explanation":"\nOxytocin stimulates the myoepithelial cells in the breast parenchyma to contract and aids in milk secretion. Oxytocin levels increase during and after delivery and also facilitate uterine contractions. Increased, rather than decreased, levels of this hormone facilitate the milk-let-down reflex.","bool":false},{"option":"Prolactin","explanation":"\nProlactin is responsible for milk production in the mammary glands. Prolactin levels increase steadily during pregnancy and reach their peak by the time of delivery. Elevated, rather than decreased, levels of this hormone correlate with milk production.","bool":false},{"option":"Thyroxine","explanation":"\nThyroxine contributes to growth and hypertrophy of the breast tissue during pregnancy. Additionally, thyroxine indirectly inhibits prolactin secretion through a negative feedback mechanism on the secretion of thyroid releasing hormone.

Physical examination shows nodulocystic acne on the face, chest, and upper back. Breast development is at Tanner stage I. Pelvic examination reveals normal pubic hair with clitoromegaly. A pelvic ultrasound shows ovaries with multiple cysts and a normal uterus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient had ambiguous genitalia as an infant and she now presents with primary amenorrhea, severe acne, a tall stature, and possibly osteoporosis (a fracture following a minor trauma). The mother had virilization during pregnancy. These features are suggestive of low estrogen and high androgen levels.","answers":[{"option":"Aromatase deficiency","explanation":"Individuals with aromatase deficiency are unable to convert androgens to estrogens. Therefore, karyotypically female (46 XX) patients are born with ambiguous external genitalia and present with female pseudohermaphroditism. Both males and females have normal internal genitalia. At the time of puberty, females fail to develop secondary sexual characteristics and typically present with amenorrhea (due to the development of ovarian cysts that impair ovulation) as well as features of virilization due to increased testosterone (e.g., severe acne, hirsutism). Mothers of affected children may develop similar features during pregnancy due to fetal androgens crossing the placenta. In addition to these abnormalities of sex development, females, as well as males, frequently have a tall stature due to a delayed fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates and signs of osteoporosis (e.g., bone fractures after minor trauma), caused by estrogen deficiency.","bool":true},{"option":"Turner syndrome","explanation":"\nTurner syndrome may present in patients who are phenotypically female with delayed puberty, primary amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. However, in contrast to this patient, children with Turner syndrome usually have short (not tall) stature and streak, atretic ovaries. A lack of additional features of Turner syndrome, such as a webbed neck or widely spaced nipples, makes the diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Kallmann syndrome","explanation":"\nKallmann syndrome, a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, typically manifests with primary amenorrhea, hyposmia/anosmia, failure to develop secondary sexual characteristics, and an absence of the growth spurt.

Since both estrogen and androgen levels are normal in these patients, virilization (e.g., clitoromegaly, acne) would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia","explanation":"\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by 21β-hydroxylase or 11β-hydroxylase deficiency is a common cause of female pseudohermaphroditism and may present with virilization and menstrual irregularities, as seen in this girl. However, affected females usually have precocious puberty with the early development of female secondary sexual characteristics due to the synthesis of estrogens from excess androgens. Furthermore, they usually present earlier in childhood with hypertension (in 11β-hydroxylase deficiency) or salt-wasting and hypotension (in 21β-hydroxylase deficiency).","bool":false},{"option":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","explanation":"\nPolycystic ovary syndrome can manifest with amenorrhea and symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as severe acne or hirsutism. While the ultrasound finding of multiple ovarian cysts raises suspicion for this diagnosis, PCOS would not explain the presence of ambiguous genitalia at birth, the absence of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., breast development), the tall stature, or osteoporosis.","bool":false}]},{"id":78,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 28-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for a rash that began 3 days ago.

If the result is positive or equivocal, a TT is performed. In the reverse testing algorithm, a TT is performed first, followed by an NTT test. A positive result for both tests strongly supports the diagnosis of syphilis. FTA-ABS tests become positive 2–3 weeks after infection and have a very high positive predictive value. Because treponemal tests usually remain positive regardless of treatment or disease activity, a positive FTA-ABS indicates either active syphilis infection or persistent antibodies from a prior infection.","bool":true},{"option":"Dark-field microscopy","explanation":"\nDark-field microscopy is capable of directly visualizing Treponema pallidum and is one of two definitive tests for detecting primary and secondary syphilis (PCR is the other), although it has been replaced in many settings by serological testing.

Her mother has hypothyroidism. The patient is at the 95th percentile for height and the 99th percentile for weight and BMI. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She has no palpable glandular breast tissue. There is coarse hair under both axillae and sparse dark hair on the mons pubis and along the labia majora. She has normal female external genitalia; there is no clitoromegaly or hirsutism. An x-ray of her left wrist and hand shows a bone age of 9 years. Her basal serum luteinizing hormone concentration is 0.05 mIU/mL (N &lt; 0.2 mIU/mL) and does not increase following GnRH agonist stimulation. Early-morning serum studies show a 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration of 105 ng/dL (N &lt; 115 ng/dL). Abdominal ultrasound shows normal adrenal glands and pelvic ultrasound shows normal female internal genitalia.

In combination with an absent luteinizing hormone response following GnRH agonist stimulation, these findings indicate peripheral precocious puberty (PPP). The absence of virilization and normal 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels narrow down the differentials.","answers":[{"option":"Obesity-related hyperandrogenemia","explanation":"The isolated premature adrenarche and pubarche observed in this patient are most likely explained by obesity-related hyperandrogenemia. A high body fat percentage induces insulin resistance. Some studies have reported an increased prevalence of insulin resistance in African-American populations independent of BMI, which further supports this etiology. Compensatory hyperinsulinemia leads to increased biosynthesis of androgens in adrenal glands and ovaries. In addition, decreased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in serum and increased aromatase levels in adipocytes increase the bioavailability of sex steroids. The resulting hyperandrogenemia triggers premature adrenarche and pubarche while high IGF-1 and estrogen levels contribute to accelerating bone growth. Increased free estrogen concentrations may also cause premature thelarche. GnRH pulsatility is not increased in PPP, which is why this child has no features of premature gonadarche or menarche.\nObesity can also lead to premature puberty via a central mechanism: Obesity in children is associated with an overproduction of leptin, which results in increased GnRH pulsatility manifesting with secondary sexual characteristics following a physiological order of development (i.e. thelarche, pubarche, gonadal maturity). A GnRH stimulation test would lead to an increase in LH and FSH.","bool":true},{"option":"Overproduction of leptin","explanation":"Overproduction of leptin is commonly observed in obese patients. Elevated leptin levels cause an increase in GnRH pulsatility, which increases the production of gonadotropins and sex hormones and induces central precocious puberty (CPP). This patient's sexual development does not follow the physiological order of CPP (i.e., thelarche, pubarche, menarche), the GnRH stimulation test is negative, and early gonadarche is not reported.","bool":false},{"option":"Adrenocortical tumor","explanation":"\nVirilizing adrenocortical tumors can cause premature adrenarche and pubarche, and some adenomas induce Cushing syndrome, which may cause weight gain, obesity, and dermatological changes, as seen in this case. However, this patient shows no signs of virilization (e.g., hirsutism, clitoromegaly), and obesity-related to Cushing syndrome usually involves the head, neck, and trunk and spares the extremities, which is not reported here. Adrenocortical masses may also cause primary adrenal insufficiency (through displacement of adrenal gland tissue) or primary hyperaldosteronism (through a functioning adenoma), but this patient has no symptoms of mineralocorticoid deficiency or excess. Finally, the adrenal ultrasound is normal, which is unlikely in patients with an adrenocortical tumor.","bool":false},{"option":"Adrenal enzyme deficiency","explanation":"\nAdrenal enzyme deficiencies are commonly associated with different types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), some of which can cause PPP. Patients with mild 21β-hydroxylase deficiency (nonclassic CAH) can present with normal isosexual external genitalia, precocious puberty, and acne, which are seen here. Females with severe 21β-hydroxylase deficiency (classic CAH) or 11β-hydroxylase deficiency may present with precocious puberty as well but typically also have features of pseudohermaphroditism (clitoromegaly or male external genitalia) and signs of virilization (e.g., hirsutism), which are not observed here. Moreover, the normal 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration seen in this patient is inconsistent with either 21β-hydroxylase or 11β-hydroxylase deficiency. 17α-hydroxylase deficiency, another type of adrenal enzyme deficiency, manifests with normal female external genitalia but would cause delayed rather than precocious puberty. Finally, severe 21β-hydroxylase deficiency and 11β-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase deficiency lead to symptomatic electrolyte abnormalities, which are not reported here.","bool":false},{"option":"Ovarian cyst","explanation":"\nHormone-producing ovarian cysts are the most common cause of PPP in females. This condition typically manifests with early breast development and is followed by episodes of vaginal bleeding, which occur due to estrogen withdrawal once the cyst regresses. This patient's symptoms and pelvic ultrasound are not consistent with this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Pituitary tumor","explanation":"\nPituitary tumors are a rare cause of central precocious puberty (CPP). Although most gonadotroph pituitary adenomas are clinically silent, some do increase LH and FSH levels sufficiently to increase the production of sex hormones; these tumors may induce premature puberty in children. This patient's sexual development does not follow the physiological order of CPP (i.e., thelarche, pubarche, menarche), the GnRH simulation test is negative, and early gonadarche is not reported.\nThis is a difficult question designed to test your knowledge about the different pathomechanisms behind precocious puberty. If a boy &lt; 9 years of age or a girl &lt; 8 years of age presents with features of puberty and their bone age differs by &gt; 1 year compared to chronological age, precocious puberty must be suspected. A GnRH stimulation test is used to differentiate between central and peripheral causes of precocious puberty. The absence of an increase in gonadotropins (LH and FSH) after GnRH stimulation indicates peripheral overproduction of sex hormones (e.g., due to estrogen-producing ovarian tumors, androgen-producing adrenal pathologies) that suppress gonadotropin production and make LH and FSH unresponsive to GnRH stimulation. In this case, the mechanism behind precocious puberty is GnRH independent, that is, peripheral.

She emigrated from Ethiopia with her family 6 months ago. She has had intermittent, painless involuntary urine leakage for many years. Her urinary incontinence worsened following the delivery of her last child. She describes the birth as having been “very difficult.” She says that she does not feel that her bladder is full. Since her early 20s, she has had multiple episodes of vaginal infections for which she received over-the-counter antibiotics. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin. Her older sister and mother had urinary incontinence starting in their mid-30s. The patient is currently not sexually active.

Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient's history of multiple vaginal infections, persistent urinary incontinence that worsened after a difficult delivery, a scar on the anterior vaginal wall, and a positive double dye test are consistent with a vesicovaginal fistula.","answers":[{"option":"Obstructed labor","explanation":"This patient's vesicovaginal fistula is most likely a result of her previous obstructed labor. The obstructed fetal head exerts pressure on the pelvic bones and causes pressure necrosis of the vaginal wall and bladder, which can result in fistula formation. Vesicovaginal fistulas are most commonly seen in individuals from resource-limited countries, where there is limited access to emergency obstetric care. In contrast, vesicovaginal fistulas in women from resource-rich countries are usually a result of iatrogenic injury (e.g., bladder injury during a hysterectomy). The diagnosis is confirmed with a double dye test, which is positive when a tampon inserted into the vagina stains blue after the bladder is filled with methylene blue. The mainstay of treatment for vesicovaginal fistulas is surgical repair.","bool":true},{"option":"Obesity","explanation":"\nObesity is an important risk factor for urinary stress incontinence, which typically manifests with intermittent involuntary leakage of urine.

PID can also manifest with urinary symptoms if the bladder is involved. However, most patients with PID and bladder involvement develop symptoms of cystitis (e.g., urinary frequency, dysuria) rather than urinary incontinence. This patient's symptoms are most like due to a vesicovaginal fistula. Although PID can cause fistula formation in severe cases, it typically affects the upper reproductive female tract (e.g., uterus, ovaries) rather than the vagina.","bool":false},{"option":"Family history","explanation":"\nFamily history is a risk factor for urge incontinence, which is typically associated with detrusor overactivity and manifests with involuntary leakage of urine. However, this patient's urinary incontinence is most likely due to a vesicovaginal fistula, which is not associated with a genetic predisposition.

However, TVUS may not reliably detect an intrauterine pregnancy before 5 weeks' gestation or before serum β-hCG is &gt; 1500–2000 mIU/mL. Therefore, in patients with β-hCG &lt; 1000 mIU/mL, as seen here, TVUS should be scheduled 2–3 days after the initial test. Repeated measurement of β-hCG is also indicated to confirm an appropriate rise in concentration (i.e., doubling of β-hCG approx. every 2.5 days within the first 4 weeks of pregnancy). A slow rise in β-hCG can indicate an ectopic pregnancy or abortion, whereas a rapid rise in the value may indicate a β-hCG-secreting tumor (e.g., hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma) or twin pregnancy.\nA history of pelvic inflammatory disease increases the risk for extrauterine pregnancy.","bool":true},{"option":"Administer methotrexate now","explanation":"\nMethotrexate can be used for the treatment of an ectopic pregnancy.

In addition, the biopsy findings rule out intraductal papilloma, which would show a central, branching, fibrovascular core with surrounding myoepithelial and epithelial cells.","bool":false},{"option":"Invasive lobular carcinoma","explanation":"\nInvasive lobular carcinoma accounts for 10–15% of breast cancers and may manifest as a painless breast nodule. Although malignancy should always be considered in breast masses, especially in middle-aged women, invasive lobular carcinoma is associated with skin changes (retraction, dimpling, edema), nipple retraction, bloody nipple discharge, and/or lymphadenopathy. Moreover, mammogram typically shows microcalcifications and spicules, and biopsy shows malignant cells in lobules and monomorphic cells in single rows.","bool":false}]},{"id":108,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a 1-month history of dull lower abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Pelvic ultrasonography shows bilateral ovarian enlargement and free fluid in the rectouterine pouch. Biopsy specimens from the ovaries show multiple, round, mucin-filled cells with flat, peripheral nuclei. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This woman has bilateral ovarian masses that contain signet ring cells (round, mucin-filled cells with a flat, peripheral nucleus), which indicates a diagnosis of Krukenberg tumor.","answers":[{"option":"Gastric wall thickening","explanation":"A Krukenberg tumor is an ovarian malignancy comprised of signet ring cells that has metastasized from a primary site, most commonly the stomach. Signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach leads to a grossly thickened and leathery stomach wall and is therefore also called linitis plastica (diffuse gastric carcinoma). The history of decreased appetite and substantial weight loss is explained by the primary malignant tumor. Metastases are typically found in both ovaries and often occur in conjunction with ascites, as seen in this patient.\nThough the diffuse type of gastric carcinoma is the most common type of gastric cancer to metastasize to the ovaries, other types of gastric cancer, as well as breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and colon cancer, can also cause Krukenberg tumor.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased testosterone levels","explanation":"Increased testosterone levels in association with abnormal ovaries could indicate polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or Sertoli-Leydig tumors. PCOS can manifest with bilateral ovarian enlargement, obesity, and signs of hyperandrogenism such as acne, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities. Pelvic ultrasonography would show enlarged ovaries with numerous anechoic cysts. Sertoli-Leydig tumors also lead to clinically apparent virilization with hirsutism and acne. Biopsy shows tubules lined by round Sertoli cells and interspersed Leydig cells, both in a fibrous stroma. Neither of these diagnoses fit with these historical elements and objective findings.","bool":false},{"option":"Dark blue peritoneal spots","explanation":"Dark blue peritoneal spots seen in endometriosis are known as powder-burn or gunshot lesions. Endometriosis can present with bilateral ovarian enlargement and abdominal pain. Histologically, this condition appears as endometrial glands in normal endometrial stroma but with a preponderance of hemosiderin-laden macrophages as a result of chronic, cyclic hemorrhages into endometriomas. This patient's weight loss and pathology findings are not consistent with endometriosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased TSH levels","explanation":"Decreased TSH levels in association with an ovarian mass, weight loss, and pelvic pain are seen in patients with struma ovarii. However, this condition typically manifests with only unilateral involvement. Additionally, biopsy would show thyroid tissue, which is not seen in this case.","bool":false},{"option":"Pleural effusion","explanation":"\nPleural effusion, in the setting of an ovarian mass, raises concern for Meigs syndrome. Caused most often by an ovarian fibroma, this condition also classically leads to abdominal ascites. Krukenburg tumors may rarely lead to pleural effusion as well, but this would not be the most likely finding on further evaluation of this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated β-hCG levels","explanation":"Elevated β-hCG levels are implicated in the development of theca lutein cysts. These typically are diagnosed in pregnancy and arise in the bilateral ovaries. Although many cases are asymptomatic, episodic peritoneal irritation as a result of cyst rupture can occur. Notable weight loss would be unlikely and histopathology would show hyperplasia of the theca interna cells but not round, mucin-filled cells as in this patient's biopsy.","bool":false}]},{"id":109,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of a 3-day history of lower abdominal pain.

As is the case here, patients with an imperforate hymen are asymptomatic until menarche, when the obstructed outflow of menstrual blood distends the vaginal tract and uterus and results in a characteristic bulging, bluish mass at the vaginal introitus (hematocolpos). Treatment of imperforate hymen includes hymenectomy and consequent evacuation of the retained blood.","bool":true},{"option":"Müllerian agenesis","explanation":"\nMüllerian agenesis (MA) manifests as primary amenorrhea in patients with normal secondary sexual characteristics. This condition causes vaginal agenesis; pelvic examination typically shows normal external genitalia and a vaginal dimple (small vaginal pouch) rather than a mass at the vaginal introitus. In almost all cases, individuals with MA also have uterine agenesis or underdevelopment and thus do not menstruate. Rarely, these individuals have a rudimentary uterus and can develop cyclic pelvic pain due to menstruation. However, because the menstrual blood cannot pass into the lower vagina, a mass would not be present at the vaginal introitus.","bool":false},{"option":"Endometriosis","explanation":"\nEndometriosis causes cyclical pelvic pain, which is seen in this patient, but does not manifest with primary amenorrhea or a bulging, bluish mass within the vaginal introitus. Additionally, this condition typically manifests in women who are 25–35 years of age and is unlikely to develop in an adolescent patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Labial adhesions","explanation":"\nLabial adhesions manifest with a thin, vertical midline fold in the perineum due to adhesions between the labia minora. This condition does not cause a mass at the vaginal introitus and is typically asymptomatic. Additionally, this condition usually affects infants and young children (peak incidence of 2 years of age) and spontaneously resolves around the time of puberty, when increased circulating levels of estrogen thicken the labia. Patients with labial adhesions typically do not have primary amenorrhea.","bool":false},{"option":"Androgen insensitivity","explanation":"\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) manifests with primary amenorrhea in patients with normal breast development and female external genitalia. However, in contrast to this patient, individuals with AIS have very sparse or absent pubic hair. Pelvic examination shows a blind-ending vaginal pouch rather than a mass at the vaginal introitus. Cryptorchid testes may be palpable as bilateral masses in the abdominal or inguinal region. AIS does not cause cyclical pelvic pain.","bool":false},{"option":"Ectopic pregnancy","explanation":"\nEctopic pregnancy can cause pelvic pain, but the pain is usually acute, nonrecurring, and develops in a postmenarchal patient after 4–6 weeks of amenorrhea (secondary amenorrhea). This patient, who has primary amenorrhea, has had recurring symptoms for 9 months. Moreover, while ectopic pregnancy can lead to an enlarged uterus or an adnexal mass, it would not manifest as a mass within the vaginal introitus.","bool":false}]},{"id":110,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 10-day history of vaginal bleeding. The flow is heavy with the passage of clots. Since menarche 1 year ago, menses have occurred at irregular 26- to 32-day intervals and last 3 to 6 days. Her last menstrual period was 4 weeks ago. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 106/70 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows vaginal bleeding. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin is 13.1 g/dL. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":2,"hint":"\nAcute abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a girl who attained menarche only one year ago is most likely caused by anovulation due to an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Anovulation leads to a deficit in progesterone production, while unopposed estrogen continues to cause abnormal growth of the endometrial lining and vessels. Spontaneous bleeding may result from sloughing of the endometrial lining. If increasing estrogen triggers negative feedback in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, a drop in FSH/LH and estrogen levels leads to a sudden loss of endometrium that can cause heavy and prolonged bleeding.\n","answers":[{"option":"Conjugated estrogen therapy","explanation":"Administration of high-dose oral conjugated estrogen is the treatment of choice in hemodynamically stable women with acute AUB, irrespective of the underlying cause. High levels of estrogen trigger rapid growth of the endometrium and thereby stop sudden, heavy bleeding from the uterine surface. Surgical treatment is needed if the patient does not respond to medical treatment or is hemodynamically unstable, bleeding is severe, medical management is contraindicated, or the underlying medical condition requires surgical repair. Conjugated estrogen therapy is contraindicated in women with breast cancer and/or those at a high risk of thrombosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Intrauterine tamponade","explanation":"An intrauterine tamponade (e.g., intrauterine balloon or gauze packing) would be the initial step to decrease severe bleeding in a hemodynamically unstable woman with acute AUB. A tamponade, in addition to intravenous fluids and blood transfusions, serves to stabilize the patient until definitive therapy can be administered.","bool":false},{"option":"Endometrial ablation","explanation":"Minimally invasive endometrial ablation is the preferred approach in hemodynamically stable women for whom medical therapy for AUB is unsuccessful or contraindicated, but it should only be performed in patients who do not wish to bear any more children. It provides long-term improvement of uterine bleeding symptoms by destroying a thin layer of the endometrium (e.g., with extreme cold, heat, or radiofrequency energy). Hysteroscopy prior to ablation may be useful for identifying and treating intrauterine structural abnormalities (e.g., polyps or fibroids).","bool":false},{"option":"Uterine artery embolization","explanation":"Transcatheter uterine artery embolization is the first-line therapy in women with AUB due to uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that can be identified on color Doppler ultrasound. Uterine AVMs are very rare and can be congenital or acquired. Acquired uterine AVMs should be suspected in women with profuse intermittent bleeding after uterine surgery (e.g., dilation and curettage, cesarean section). This patient has no history of surgical procedures performed on the uterus or profuse bleeding during menses since menarche (in keeping with congenital uterine AVM), making an AVM unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Uterine curettage","explanation":"Dilation and uterine curettage with concomitant hysteroscopy is the preferred approach in hemodynamically unstable women with severe AUB after immediate supportive measures (e.g., fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion) have been implemented. It is both diagnostic and therapeutic (i.e., used to identify intrauterine pathologies, take tissue samples, remove excess uterine lining) and preserves fertility as well. If performed rapidly, it may decrease bleeding in less than an hour.","bool":false},{"option":"Tranexamic acid","explanation":"Oral or IV tranexamic acid is a second-line agent used for treating blood loss in acute AUB when other options have failed. Tranexamic acid acts within 2–3 hours of administration and should not be used in women at a high risk of thrombosis.","bool":false}]},{"id":111,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 22-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of left lower abdominal pain that began suddenly while she was running.

There is no tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Urine pregnancy test is negative. An ultrasound is ordered to confirm the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst. Visualization of fluid in which of the following locations would be most consistent with this diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"","answers":[{"option":"Rectouterine pouch","explanation":"The rectouterine pouch (pouch of Douglas) is an anatomic space located between the rectum and the uterus in females. It is the lowest point of the peritoneal cavity and therefore a common site of fluid collection (e.g., blood, serous fluid) in supine patients. A pelvic ultrasound showing free fluid in the rectouterine pouch would support the clinical diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst in a patient with classic features, as seen here.","bool":true},{"option":"Hepatorenal space","explanation":"The hepatorenal space (Morison pouch) is an anatomic space between the right kidney and the right lobe of the liver. It is a common site of fluid accumulation in a recumbent patient with intra-abdominal bleeding or ascites. Rupture of a large hemorrhagic ovarian cyst could cause hemoperitoneum with collection of blood in this space, but it is not the most likely site of free fluid accumulation in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Splenorenal angle","explanation":"The splenorenal angle (Koller pouch) is an anatomic space between the spleen and the left kidney. It is a common site of fluid accumulation in a recumbent patient with intra-abdominal bleeding or ascites.

It is the lowest point of the peritoneal cavity and a common site of intrapelvic free fluid accumulation in men. Women do not have a rectovesical pouch because the uterus is located between the rectum and the bladder.","bool":false},{"option":"Lesser sac","explanation":"The lesser sac (omental bursa) is the largest intraperitoneal recess and lies dorsal to the stomach and lesser omentum. It is a common site of fluid accumulation in patients with intra-abdominal bleeding or acute pancreatitis.

She describes the discharge as yellow and mucopurulent. She has also noticed vaginal bleeding after sexual activity. She has not had any itching or irritation. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 108/62 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a friable cervix. Speculum examination is unremarkable. Urine pregnancy test is negative. A wet mount shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic test?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Yellow mucopurulent discharge, bleeding after sexual activity, and a friable cervix on pelvic examination are all suggestive of bacterial cervicitis. The most common causes of bacterial cervicitis are Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.","answers":[{"option":"Nucleic acid amplification test","explanation":"\nNucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) of vaginal fluid is the test of choice in the diagnosis of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. NAAT provides a rapid result, has a high sensitivity, and can differentiate between C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infection. It has therefore widely replaced tests such as cultures and Gram staining.","bool":true},{"option":"Tzanck smear","explanation":"A Tzanck smear can be used in the diagnosis of viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus infection. Scrapings from the base of a herpetic lesion typically show multinucleated giant cells (Tzanck cells). Although genital herpes may manifest with vaginal discharge, the lack of “punched-out” painful lesions and ulcer rules out this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Colposcopy","explanation":"\nColposcopy is commonly used to evaluate cervical abnormalities found on cancer screening tests such as Pap smears. It is not helpful in diagnosing the causal pathogen in patients with cervicitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Gram stain of cervical swab ","explanation":"A Gram stain of a cervical swab is used to detect bacterial infections of the cervix. However, it has a relatively low sensitivity and cannot be used to diagnose infection with C. trachomatis, which is an obligate intracellular pathogen and therefore difficult to stain. The test has been widely replaced by more sensitive and specific tests with the ability to diagnose both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Pap smear ","explanation":"A Pap smear is used in screening for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical carcinoma. Advanced cervical cancer can manifest with abnormal cervical discharge and bleeding, as in this patient. However, the acute onset of symptoms and the absence of a visible lesion on pelvic examination make infectious cervicitis more likely.

A first-line treatment for women with PCOS pursuing pregnancy is clomiphene.","answers":[{"option":"Inhibition of hypothalamic estrogen receptors","explanation":"\nInhibition of hypothalamic estrogen receptors is the mechanism of action of clomiphene, a first-line drug for ovulation induction in women with infertility from PCOS. Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that binds to the hypothalamic estrogen receptors, thereby blocking the negative feedback effect of circulating endogenous estradiol. This results in an increase in the pulsatile secretion of GnRH and subsequent increase in both FSH and LH, stimulating ovulation. Around 80% of all women with PCOS ovulate after taking clomiphene citrate and 50% actually conceive.","bool":true},{"option":"Activation of pituitary dopamine receptors","explanation":"Activation of pituitary dopamine receptors is the mechanism of action of bromocriptine, which is used in women who suffer from anovulatory infertility due to hyperprolactinemia. Elevated serum prolactin levels inhibit GnRH secretion, resulting in low levels of FSH and LH (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Patients would present with anovulation, amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and possibly symptoms of a pituitary macroadenoma (headaches, bitemporal hemianopia). Bromocriptine is not used to treat infertility caused by PCOS.","bool":false},{"option":"Activation of granulosa cell aromatase","explanation":"Inhibition, not activation of granulosa cell aromatase, is the mechanism of action of letrozole, which lowers estrogen levels by inhibiting the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Treatment with letrozole is associated with increased live birth rates compared to treatment with clomiphene citrate. Letrozole is thus considered a first-line treatment for women with PCOS who wish to conceive.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of endometrial progesterone receptors","explanation":"Inhibition of endometrial progesterone receptors is the mechanism of action of mifepristone, which is used in conjunction with a prostaglandin analog (e.g., misoprostol) for medical termination of pregnancy. It is not used to treat infertility in PCOS.","bool":false},{"option":"Activation of ovarian luteinizing hormone receptors","explanation":"Activation of ovarian luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors is caused by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as LH and hCG have a similar molecular structure and share the same receptors. Injectable hCG causes an LH surge that stimulates ovarian follicular maturation and ovulation and is therefore used to induce ovulation in infertile women.

Normal laboratory studies are consistent with this diagnosis, except in rare cases of complications (e.g., hemorrhage, tissue necrosis). Ovarian enlargement due to cysts, ectopic pregnancy, or tumors (e.g., thecoma) is the most important risk factor for ovarian torsion. Pelvic Doppler ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis and would show an enlarged, edematous ovary with decreased blood flow. Emergency exploratory laparoscopy with adnexal detorsion to preserve ovarian function is the mainstay of treatment.","bool":true},{"option":"Tuboovarian abscess","explanation":"\nTuboovarian abscess often manifests with nausea, vomiting, and unilateral abdominal pain and tenderness to palpation.

This finding and the patient's clinical presentation of infertility, high BMI (indicating obesity), and virilization (e.g., androgenic alopecia, hirsutism) are typical of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).","answers":[{"option":"Sex hormone-binding globulin concentration","explanation":"The majority of patients with PCOS are obese and have peripheral insulin resistance, which results in hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia ultimately leads to a decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentration via two mechanisms. Hyperinsulinemia directly inhibits the production of SHBG in the liver. At the same time, hyperinsulinemia stimulates ovarian theca cells to produce androgens (e.g., androstenedione, testosterone), which in turn also suppress SHBG production. The other important change in PCOS is increased secretion of luteinizing hormone, which also stimulates theca cells to produce androgens. The increase in total androgen levels coupled with an increase in the proportion of free androgen (due to a decrease in SHBG concentration) results in virilization, as seen here. The androgens also decrease follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by negative feedback. Decreased levels of FSH arrest antral development, causing anovulatory cycles, which prevents progesterone secretion and subsequently causes affected individuals to become infertile.\nSHBG production is decreased by insulin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), androgens, and prolactin; production is increased by estrogen and thyroxine. Other causes of decreased SHBG levels are hypothyroidism, acromegaly, hyperprolactinemia, and the use of anabolic steroids.","bool":true},{"option":"Fasting insulin concentration","explanation":"\nFasting insulin concentration would increase rather than decrease because of an increase in pancreatic insulin secretion in response to peripheral insulin resistance, which is a characteristic feature of PCOS. Fasting insulin secretion would be decreased in conditions associated with pancreatic beta-cell destruction such as type 1 diabetes mellitus.","bool":false},{"option":"Testosterone concentration","explanation":"The production of testosterone in the ovaries is stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH). Patients with PCOS typically have elevated LH levels and therefore an increased concentration of testosterone. Decreased testosterone levels are typically seen in conditions that cause hypogonadism (both primary and secondary).","bool":false},{"option":"Androstenedione concentration","explanation":"\nAndrostenedione is produced mainly in the adrenal glands and, to a lesser degree, in the gonads. In patients with PCOS, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels increase. Since LH directly stimulates the secretion of androstenedione in the ovarian theca cells, the androstenedione concentration increases rather than decreases in PCOS.","bool":false},{"option":"Luteinizing hormone:follicle-stimulating hormone ratio","explanation":"\nLuteinizing hormone (LH) secretion is increased in patients with PCOS; the reason for this increase is not completely understood. LH stimulates theca cells in the ovary to produce androgens, which decrease the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) via negative feedback. As a result of increased LH and decreased FSH levels, the LH:FSH ratio is typically increased in patients with PCOS.","bool":false},{"option":"Estrogen concentration","explanation":"Normally, estrogens are produced from androgens through the action of aromatase mainly in the granulosa cells and, to a lesser degree, in adipose tissue. In individuals with PCOS, granulosa cells do not develop due to arrested antral follicle development. However, affected individuals also have increased androgen levels, and the peripheral aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue compensates for the lack of granulosa cell activity. Also, individuals with PCOS are often obese and tend to have a higher level of peripheral aromatase activity, so their estrogen levels remain normal or even increase slightly. Conditions associated with decreased estrogen concentration include menopause, ovarian insufficiency, and hyperprolactinemia.","bool":false}]},{"id":122,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"\nA 21-year-old female college student comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of vaginal itching and burning.

Moreover, DM results in immunodeficiency, which is also associated with an increased risk of persistent or recurrent yeast infection. Other risk factors that precipitate overgrowth of C. albicans are systemic antibiotic therapy and pregnancy, in which case high levels of estrogen favor overgrowth by Candida. Treatment of acute infection consists of topical azoles (e.g., miconazole, clotrimazole), topical nystatin (not available in the US), or a single dose of oral fluconazole. Maintaining normal blood sugar levels may help reduce the risk of recurrent or persistent infections in patients with DM.","bool":true},{"option":"Intrauterine device","explanation":"\nIntrauterine devices may be associated with gynecologic infections and pelvic inflammatory disease.

She has been unable to conceive for 1 year despite regular intercourse with her husband twice per week. Recent analysis of her husband's semen showed a normal sperm count. Two years ago, she had an episode of a febrile illness with lower abdominal pain, which resolved under treatment with a medication she cannot recall. Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 4 to 5 days. Before her marriage, she was sexually active with 4 male partners and used a combined oral contraceptive pill with estrogen and progesterone consistently, in addition to barrier protection inconsistently. One year ago, she stopped using the oral contraceptive pill to try and conceive. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m2. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's infertility?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This woman previously engaged in high-risk sexual behavior (inconsistent use of barrier protection) and had an episode of lower abdominal pain and febrile illness.

In patients with a uterus present on ultrasound, the assessment of FSH and LH levels is the next diagnostic step. A high serum FSH level is indicative of gonadal dysgenesis, most commonly due to chromosomal aberrations, e.g., in Turner syndrome (45,XO). Causes of a low serum FSH level include constitutional growth delay, functional growth delay (e.g., in medical illness, malnutrition), and hypothalamic-pituitary disorders (e.g., malformations, hemochromatosis, injury, Kallmann syndrome, normosmic isolated GnRH deficiency). Further testing depends on the suspected etiology and includes serum TSH and prolactin levels to rule out uncommon causes of primary amenorrhea (e.g., hyperprolactinemia caused by a prolactinoma or hypothyroidism).\nIn patients without a uterus on ultrasound, serum testosterone levels and karyotyping should be used to determine the underlying pathology (e.g., Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity syndrome).\n\n","bool":true},{"option":"MRI of the brain","explanation":"An MRI of the brain is only indicated if FSH levels are low and a hypothalamic or pituitary disease (e.g., pituitary tumor) is suspected, which could cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and subsequent primary amenorrhea.

Although granulosa cell tumors are more common in perimenopausal patients, there is a rare juvenile type that typically manifests with PPP and a bone age greater than chronological age. Because of the high levels of estrogen produced by these tumors, LH production is suppressed and there is no LH response to GnRH agonist stimulation. Pediatric patients with estrogen-secreting tumors are usually taller than their peers, but if the condition is untreated, they often have a short stature in adulthood due to early closure of the epiphyseal plate.\nPatients with granulosa cell tumors may have a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, and pelvic imaging usually shows enlarged ovaries.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":1,"hint":"A palpable breast mass requires further assessment regardless of the clinical features of the mass and the patient's age.","answers":[{"option":"Breast ultrasound","explanation":"\nBreast ultrasound is the most appropriate next step when evaluating a palpable breast mass in women &lt; 30 years of age. Premenopausal women &lt; 30 years of age often have dense breast tissue, which decreases the diagnostic accuracy of mammography in these individuals. Furthermore, ultrasound imaging does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, unlike mammography. Breast ultrasonography helps distinguish solid lesions from benign cysts, as well as evaluate axillary, supraclavicular, and infraclavicular lymph nodes. If imaging reveals signs of malignancy (e.g., mass irregularity, heterogenicity, spiculated margin), mammography, in addition to ultrasound, can be performed and a biopsy of the lesion is indicated.\nFor women between 30 and 39 years of age, both mammography and ultrasound can be used; mammography is the recommended imaging modality in women ≥ 40 years of age.","bool":true},{"option":"Mammography","explanation":"\nMammography is used for the evaluation of palpable breast masses in women ≥ 40 years of age. This screening modality is also recommended for breast cancer screening in this age group (i.e., ≥ 40 years) because it can detect the majority of malignancies and lesions ∼ 2 years before they are clinically evident.

Since the ovaries are the predominant source of estrogen, many patients with Turner syndrome have estrogen deficiency, resulting in increased osteoclast activity, decreased osteoblast activity, and bone reabsorption. This places these patients at increased risk for osteoporosis and pathologic fractures. Therefore, almost all patients with Turner syndrome require estrogen and progesterone replacement therapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Severe acne","explanation":"\nSevere acne is commonly seen in patients with double Y syndrome.

This patient's history of inconsistent condom use and previous trichomoniasis indicates an elevated risk of future STIs. The presence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci in the microscopy of this patient's discharge specimen confirms that the infection is caused by N. gonorrhoeae.\nBecause Gram stain is often false negative, the test of choice for detecting gonorrhea is the nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT).","bool":true},{"option":"Klebsiella granulomatis","explanation":"\nKlebsiella granulomatis is a gram-negative bacillus that causes granuloma inguinale. Although this patient demonstrates an elevated risk of STI contraction (as evidenced by inconsistent condom use, with a history of previous STI), granuloma inguinale would typically present with painless genital lesions. Also, the absence of gram-negative bacilli in the microscopy of this patient's discharge specimen confirms that the infection is not caused by this bacterium.","bool":false},{"option":"Treponema pallidum","explanation":"\nT. pallidum causes syphilis. The characteristic genital lesion of primary syphilis (raised genital papule that evolves into a painless, firm ulcer with indurated borders) is not seen in this patient, nor is associated lymphadenopathy.

Pregnancy is detectable 6–9 days after fertilization in serum (or ∼ 14 days after fertilization in urine). Amenorrhea (primary or secondary), polyuria, and fatigue are among the most common signs of early pregnancy; additional signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, breast enlargement and tenderness, and weight gain. This 16-year-old girl's presentation raises suspicion for pregnancy, and although she reports that she has not had her first menstrual period yet, pregnancy should be ruled out first before performing other diagnostic steps.","bool":true},{"option":"Urinalysis and urine culture","explanation":"\nUrinalysis and urine culture are used in the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can cause increased urination, abdominal pain, and fatigue.

Which of the following processes is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The patient's colicky abdominal pain and multiple small intraluminal gallbladder masses on ultrasound indicate biliary colic due to cholelithiasis. Pregnancy, with its hormonal changes, is a known risk factor for this condition.","answers":[{"option":"Increased secretion of cholesterol","explanation":"Beginning in the third trimester of pregnancy, increased circulating estrogen levels result in an increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis and the formation of cholesterol-supersaturated bile. Moreover, higher progesterone levels cause smooth muscle relaxation, decreased and incomplete emptying of the gallbladder, and subsequent bile stasis. Together, cholesterol-rich lithogenic bile and gallbladder stasis predispose to gallstone formation. Similarly, hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptive use also predispose to cholelithiasis.","bool":true},{"option":"Overproduction of bilirubin","explanation":"Overproduction of bilirubin is not responsible for the increased risk of cholelithiasis in pregnancy. Increased bilirubin production contributes to black pigment stones in patients with chronic hemolytic anemias, such as hereditary spherocytosis. Hemolysis results in the increased breakdown of hemoglobin to heme and subsequently to bilirubin. Bile supersaturated with bilirubin can precipitate and form gallstones. Gallstones in pregnancy are usually due to a different cause.","bool":false},{"option":"Accelerated gallbladder emptying","explanation":"Accelerated gallbladder emptying is not responsible for gallstone formation; conversely, decreased gallbladder motility causes bile stasis and gallstone formation. Gallbladder stasis is seen in pregnancy due to elevated progesterone levels, which can lead to smooth muscle relaxation and bile stasis. Gallbladder stasis can also occur in patients on prolonged total parenteral nutrition.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased secretion of bile acids","explanation":"An increase in progesterone levels during pregnancy results in decreased, not increased, bile acid secretion. Bile acids are important surfactants that help dissolve cholesterol in bile. Reduced bile acid levels (e.g., in pregnancy, cystic fibrosis, or due to malabsorption in inflammatory bowel disease) can predispose to gallstone formation.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased caliber of bile duct","explanation":"The caliber of bile ducts does not alter significantly during pregnancy when compared to the nonpregnant population. Therefore, it is unlikely involved in the pathogenesis of gallstones in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Reduced production of cholecystokinin","explanation":"Production of CCK is increased rather than decreased in pregnancy. CCK promotes secretion of bile acids and stimulates gallbladder contraction after a meal, thereby reducing the likeliness of gallstone formation. However, the overall effect of pregnancy is one of bile stasis. This effect is due to higher progesterone levels, which result in smooth muscle relaxation, impaired gallbladder contraction, and subsequent bile stasis, predisposing to cholelithiasis.","bool":false}]},{"id":143,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician for exertional leg pain.

Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient's signs and symptoms of claudication with exertion and delayed femoral pulses are suggestive of aortic coarctation. Coarctation of the aorta, short stature, webbed neck (excess skin folds), and cubitus valgus (increased carrying angle) deformity are characteristic features of Turner syndrome.","answers":[{"option":"Ovarian dysgenesis","explanation":"\nGonadal dysgenesis and subsequent streak ovaries are characteristic findings in Turner syndrome. Failure of the germ cells to develop into ovaries results in deposition of hormonally inactive connective tissue. The absence of functional ovaries leads to estrogen and progesterone deficiencies, which cause delayed puberty, primary amenorrhea, infertility, and osteoporosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Horseshoe adrenal gland","explanation":"A horseshoe kidney, not a horseshoe adrenal gland, is an anomaly seen in approx. 10% of patients with Turner syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Mitral valve prolapse","explanation":"Although mitral valve prolapse is seen in several genetic conditions, such as Marfan syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome, it is not a typical finding in Turner syndrome.

L1–L3 serotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which manifests initially with a painless papule that resolves and then causes suppurative lymphadenopathy 2–6 weeks later. Treponema pallidum is responsible for syphilis, which manifests in the primary stage as a painless round and firm ulcer with no lymph node involvement. Neither syphilis nor LGV are associated with multiple painful shallow ulcers, making them unlikely diagnoses.","bool":false},{"option":"Curettage","explanation":"\nCurettage is used to treat warts (caused by human papillomavirus) but not genital herpes. Genital warts can be transmitted sexually but present as painless papular growths and are not associated with tender lymphadenopathy, multiple painful shallow ulcers, or malaise, making this diagnosis very unlikely.

However, the lesion is generally painless.","bool":false},{"option":"Azithromycin therapy","explanation":"\nAzithromycin is commonly used in the treatment of sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and chancroid. Chlamydia infection is commonly asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients typically present with pelvic pain, not skin lesions and lymphadenopathy. Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi and manifests with multiple painful papules or pustules that erode into ulcers. Chancroid ulcers are usually larger (10–20 mm) and deeper than the ones seen here, and they have a greyish necrotic base and purulent exudate.","bool":false}]},{"id":145,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician a week after noticing a lump in her left breast. Three months ago, she was discharged from the hospital after treatment of multiple injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her mother died of ovarian cancer. Examination shows a 2.5-cm, nontender mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Mammography shows a circumscribed radiolucent lesion with a rim of peripheral calcification. A photomicrograph of tissue from a biopsy of the mass is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the breast swelling?","difficulty":2,"hint":"","answers":[{"option":"Release of cytoplasmic triglycerides","explanation":"Release of cytoplasmic triglycerides causes fat necrosis of the breast, which typically occurs following trauma, such as that sustained by this patient. Trauma damages adipocytes in breast tissue, spilling lipase and triglycerides into the interstitium. Triglycerides are then broken down by lipase into free fatty acids that bind with calcium to form calcium salts (saponification). The resulting inflammatory process walls off the injury as an oil cyst surrounded by necrotic, anucleate adipocytes; foam cells; and other inflammatory cells, as in the biopsy here. Fat necrosis of the breast can resemble malignancy on physical examination (painless lump) and/or imaging (calcifications), often making histological confirmation necessary.","bool":true},{"option":"Obstruction of lactiferous ducts","explanation":"Obstruction of lactiferous ducts can result in a palpable breast lump due to breast abscess, a complication of mastitis. Breast abscess typically manifests as a tender breast lump with signs of inflammation (erythema, warmth, and tenderness) in lactating women. This patient's lump, however, is nontender lump and she is not lactating. Mammography of breast abscess, though not typically performed, would show a heterogenic mass without calcification, in contrast to the calcification seen here. Biopsy would show an acute inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils and cellular debris (liquefactive necrosis).","bool":false},{"option":"Stimulation of estrogen receptors","explanation":"Stimulation of estrogen receptors is the underlying cause for the development of fibroadenoma, fibrocystic breast changes, and ER-positive breast cancer. All three of these conditions may present with a painless breast lump and calcifications on mammography, as seen in this patient. However, a fibroadenoma would show proliferation of glandular and stromal tissue on histopathology, while fibrocystic breast changes often cause nipple discharge, show numerous small cysts on mammography, and appear as proliferation of small ductules and acini in lobules on histopathology. Breast cancer is also unlikely because it would appear as an ill-defined mass with irregular microcalcifications on mammography, and cells with features of malignant transformation (e.g., hyperchromatism, mitotic figures) in the ducts or lobules on biopsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Defect in DNA repair","explanation":"Defective DNA repair is the underlying cause of hereditary breast cancer syndromes (e.g., BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, Lynch syndrome). Breast cancer can manifest as a painless breast lump and this patient has a high risk of developing breast cancer based on her age and family history of ovarian cancer. However, breast cancer would typically appear on mammography as an ill-defined mass with irregular microcalcifications and not as the circumscribed radiolucent lesion seen here. Moreover, cells with features of malignant transformation (e.g., hyperchromatism, mitotic figures, nuclear pleomorphism) would have been present in the ducts or lobules on biopsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Thrombophlebitis of subcutaneous veins","explanation":"\nThrombophlebitis of superficial veins of the breast (Mondor disease) can occur secondary to trauma. However, it would manifest as a tender, palpable superficial cord on the anterolateral surface of the breast and not as the painless lump seen here. Mammography, though not typically done in Mondor disease, would show a superficial tubular hypodense lesion. A biopsy would show a thrombosed vein and acute inflammatory infiltrate, none of which are seen here.","bool":false}]},{"id":146,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 64-year-old nulliparous woman comes to the physician because of fatigue and an increase in abdominal girth despite a 5-kg (11.0-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months.

This patient has several risk factors for ovarian cancer such as nulliparity, early menarche, and late menopause. Given her symptoms and her risk factors, it is very likely that this patient's CA-125 is elevated.\nThis patient's CA-125 levels should be used in conjunction with transvaginal ultrasound to assess the size and characteristics of her adnexal mass, followed by surgery to conclusively determine pathology. After diagnosis and initiation of treatment for ovarian cancer, CA-125 levels may be used as a prognostic marker as well as a marker for how well the cancer is responding to treatment.","bool":true},{"option":"Proliferation of endometrial glands","explanation":"Women with excessive estrogen exposure from nulliparity, early menarche, and late menopause, as in this patient, are at increased risk for developing endometrial cancer. In endometrial cancer, endometrial glands undergo excessive cell growth and proliferation. However, early endometrial carcinoma is almost always associated with vaginal bleeding after menopause. This patient's symptoms of bloating, ascites, and weight loss in the setting of an adnexal mass are more suggestive of ovarian cancer, though.","bool":false},{"option":"Chocolate cyst of the left ovary","explanation":"When endometriosis affects the ovaries, blood may build up over months or years and eventually turn brown, forming what is known as a chocolate cyst or ovarian endometrioma.

Choriocarcinoma often presents with vaginal bleeding, shortness of breath, or chest pain, usually in patients of childbearing age. It is incredibly rare in women over the age of 40. Germ cell tumors produce different symptoms depending on where they arise, but usually also affect a population under the age of 30.

She has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. She took an oral contraceptive for 20 years. Current medications include hormone replacement therapy and a calcium supplement. On examination, a 2.5-cm, hard, nontender mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Examination of the right breast and axillae shows no abnormalities.

Also, biopsy would show proliferation of cells that invade through the basement membrane, not foam cells and giant cells.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Wide excision","explanation":"Wide excision is indicated for phyllodes tumors because of their high rate of recurrence and potential for malignancy. A core biopsy specimen of a phyllodes tumor would show a leaf-like structure with papillary projections of epithelium-lined stroma, not foam cells and giant cells, the presence of which indicates fat necrosis of the breast. Excision may sometimes be considered in patients with fat necrosis of the breast who develop significant pain, discomfort, or distortion of the breast.","bool":false},{"option":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy","explanation":"In patients with breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can reduce the size of the tumor before surgery to allow for greater preservation of normal tissue (e.g., by performing a lumpectomy instead of mastectomy).

Application of estrogen cream is the first-line therapy for symptomatic labial fusion. The etiology of this condition is likely multifactorial and may involve thinning of the vulvar epithelial lining from low levels of estrogen (due to postpartum loss of in utero exposure to maternal estrogen) and chronic inflammation (e.g., from recurrent urinary tract infections).

Because DHT is required for the in-utero differentiation and development of external male genitalia and the prostate, these organs are underdeveloped in individuals with 5-α reductase deficiency. At birth, most affected individuals have female-appearing external genitalia, although a range of presentations is possible, including pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias. During adolescence, the fully developed testes produce increased levels of testosterone, resulting in masculinization of the external genitalia and the development of male secondary sexual characteristics such as body hair (which can be mistaken for hirsutism). Uterus, ovaries, and glandular breast tissue are absent because the patient is karyotypically male (XY).","bool":true},{"option":"Complete androgen insensitivity","explanation":"Patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are genetically male but phenotypically female. As in this patient, they present with primary amenorrhea because they have no uterus or ovaries, and ultrasound would show intraabdominal or inguinal testes, which could cause pain as they grow during puberty. Unlike this patient, patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome develop normally without clitoromegaly or pronounced body hair.","bool":false},{"option":"Mullerian duct agenesis","explanation":"Isolated agenesis of the Mullerian ducts would result in primary amenorrhea and an absent uterus on ultrasonography.

These findings are consistent with low estrogen and high androgen levels. Her mother also experienced symptoms of virilization during pregnancy, which is another characteristic feature of this patient's disease.","answers":[{"option":"Aromatase deficiency","explanation":"Individuals with aromatase deficiency are unable to convert androgens to estrogens. Therefore, karyotypically female (46 XX) patients are born with ambiguous external genitalia and female internal reproductive organs. At puberty, affected individuals typically present with absent secondary sexual characteristics, amenorrhea (due to absent estrogen activity and the development of ovarian cysts, which impair ovulation), and features of virilization (due to increased testosterone levels). In addition, both men and women have a tall stature due to a delayed fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates, and signs of osteoporosis (e.g., bone fractures after minor trauma; caused by estrogen deficiency). Mothers of affected children may also have a history of developing similar features during pregnancy due to fetal androgens crossing the placenta.","bool":true},{"option":"Turner syndrome","explanation":"\nTurner syndrome may manifest in patients who are phenotypically female with delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea.

Moreover, a lack of additional features of Turner syndrome such as a webbed neck or widely spaced nipples, makes the diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Imperforate hymen","explanation":"An imperforate hymen is a possible cause of primary amenorrhea. Patients with an imperforate hymen usually present at puberty with periodic abdominal pain. Secondary sexual characteristics would develop normally. In addition, a tall stature, osteoporosis, and virilization would not be expected with an imperforate hymen. These features suggest a disturbance of the sex hormones rather than just an anatomical variant.","bool":false},{"option":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia","explanation":"\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common cause of female pseudohermaphroditism and may manifest with virilization and menstrual irregularities, both of which are seen here. However, affected female individuals usually have precocious puberty with the early development of female secondary sexual characteristics (due to synthesis of estrogens from excess androgens). In addition, they typically present earlier in childhood with salt-wasting and hypotension (in 21β-hydroxylase deficiency) or hypertension (in 11β-hydroxylase deficiency). Moreover, CAH does not explain this patient's tall stature or her mother's history of virilization during pregnancy.","bool":false},{"option":"Müllerian agenesis","explanation":"\nMüllerian agenesis may manifest with primary amenorrhea in a phenotypically female patient with normal ovaries, as seen in this case, but a uterus and other derivatives of the Mullerian ducts would not be present. Furthermore, secondary sexual characteristics would be normal. Since both estrogen and androgen levels are normal in these patients, they typically present with unambiguous female rather than ambiguous external genitalia and virilization would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperprolactinemia","explanation":"\nHyperprolactinemia may cause primary amenorrhea by suppressing GnRH, which results in decreased levels of luteinizing hormone as well as follicle-stimulating hormone and subsequently decreased levels of estrogen and testosterone (i.e., hypogonatrophic hypogonadism). Since androgen levels are low, virilization and ambiguous external genitalia would not be expected at birth. In addition, symptoms of the underlying cause, such as headaches and impaired vision in patients with hyperprolactinoma, are usually present. Although oral contraceptive pills are a risk factor for the development of hyperprolactinemia (estrogen stimulates prolactin production), this patient's findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Pregnancy","explanation":"\nAmenorrhea (secondary or primary) should always raise suspicion for pregnancy, even if the patient takes oral contraceptive pills. However, this girl has no other findings consistent with pregnancy (e.g., weight gain, breast enlargement, discomfort), making the diagnosis unlikely. In addition, pregnancy would not explain the presence of ambiguous genitalia at birth, absence of secondary sexual characteristics, tall stature, or osteoporosis. While certain fetal conditions or abnormalities of the placenta may lead to virilization in the pregnant mother, gestational virilization would not explain this girl's severe acne over 2 years.","bool":false},{"option":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","explanation":"\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can manifest with amenorrhea and symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as severe acne or hirsutism.

This patient's pain is bilateral, and although she had dyspareunia during sexual intercourse 3 days ago, her symptoms began 2 days prior to that. Moreover, the pain of a ruptured ovarian cyst is usually not associated with signs of infection such as fever or purulent discharge","bool":false},{"option":"Vulvovaginitis","explanation":"This patient's lower abdominal pain, purulent discharge, dyspareunia, and dysuria are all characteristic of vulvovaginitis. However, the pelvic examination shows cervical motion tenderness, which is characteristic of inflammation of the upper reproductive tract rather than the vulva or vagina. She also has symptoms that are generally more severe than those caused by vulvovaginitis (e.g., severe pain, fever).","bool":false},{"option":"Cystitis","explanation":"This patient presents with dysuria and lower abdominal pain, both of which are symptoms of cystitis. However, cystitis does not typically manifest with cervical motion tenderness or vaginal discharge, although gross hematuria may be present.

SERMs (both tamoxifen and raloxifene) have selective agonist activity of estrogen receptors in bone tissue, which means they decrease the risk of osteoporosis. With tamoxifen specifically, a similar partial estrogenic effect also occurs in the uterus, which actually increases the risk of endometrial carcinoma and uterine sarcoma. Raloxifene, however, has an antagonistic effect of estrogen receptors on the uterus, which decreases the risk of these cancers.","bool":true},{"option":"Monoclonal antibody against tyrosine kinase receptor","explanation":"\nTrastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as HER2/neu or ERB-B2), a tyrosine kinase receptor.

This patient is most likely to have which of the following karyotypes?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Further testing will show elevated LH and testosterone levels.","answers":[{"option":"46,XY","explanation":"Patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) are karyotypically male (46,XY). The Y chromosome results in the formation of the testes from the undifferentiated fetal gonad. However, the genital tubercle does not respond to testosterone in complete AIS, and masculinization of external genitalia does not occur. The uterus and upper third of the vagina do not develop because the anti-Mullerian hormone secreted by the testes causes Mullerian duct atresia. Androgen insensitivity also results in a failure of the cranial suspensory ligament to regress, meaning the testes remain in the abdomen or inguinal canal instead of the perineal region. Patients are born with female external genitalia and generally raised as females. At the time of puberty, axillary and pubic hair growth does not occur since cutaneous androgen receptors are also insensitive. Breast development occurs despite the absence of ovaries since aromatase in adipose tissue converts androgens produced by the inguinal testes to estradiol. LH levels are increased due to the lack of negative feedback by androgens on the androgen-insensitive pituitary. Testosterone levels will be increased due to stimulation of the Leydig cells of the intra-abdominal testes by increased LH levels.","bool":true},{"option":"47,XXY","explanation":"A 47,XXY karyotype is seen in Klinefelter syndrome, which can cause breast development (gynecomastia) and impaired pubic hair growth.

While they are most commonly asymptomatic, follicular cysts may cause dull pelvic pain due to mass effect or menstrual cycle irregularities (e.g., heavy or irregular periods, intermenstrual spotting) due to estrogen production and endometrial hyperplasia. Pelvic ultrasound of a follicular cyst will show a single fluid-filled, unilocular, anechoic cyst with a thin and smooth wall and without solid components, which is consistent with this patient's ultrasound results. In the absence of complications (e.g., ovarian torsion, cyst rupture), watchful waiting is recommended because follicular cysts often regress spontaneously.\nNSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) can be given to patients with painful cysts. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) protect against the development of functional ovarian cysts by preventing ovulation. However, OCPs do not help in the treatment of existing functional cysts.","bool":true},{"option":"Corpeus luteum cyst","explanation":"\nCorpus luteum cysts are most often asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally on pelvic ultrasound during early pregnancy. Corpus luteum cysts are the most common cause of ovarian mass in pregnancy. However, this woman's urine pregnancy test is negative, making this diagnosis less likely.

In the testis, Sertoli cells produce MIF, and Leydig cells secrete testosterone. MIF leads to suppression of paramesonephric ducts, whereas testosterone converts the mesonephric ducts into male internal genitalia (i.e., seminal vesicle, epididymis, ejaculatory duct, ductus deferens). Testosterone is then converted to DHT (via 5α reductase), which is responsible for the development of male external genitalia (from genital tubercle, urethral folds, and genital swelling) and urogenital sinus differentiation (into bulbourethral glands and prostate gland).

In the absence of DHT, karyotypically male (XY) patients are born with undervirilized male external genitalia. The condition has variable expressivity; at birth, the genitalia can vary in appearance from female external genitalia with or without clitoromegaly to male external genitalia with microphallus and/or hypospadias. Patients with female external genitalia are diagnosed at puberty when virilization occurs, while those with clitoromegaly, microphallus, or hypospadias are usually diagnosed at birth. The development of internal genitalia is unaffected in 5-ARD, and karyotypically male patients have testes (as intraabdominal or inguinal masses). Patients with 5-ARD have usually normal levels of testosterone, estrogen, FSH, and LH because of an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing.\nManagement requires multidisciplinary care and is dependent on the time of diagnosis and the appearance of the genitalia.

However, nephrotic syndrome is rare in newborns and the edema in nephrotic syndrome typically begins in the periorbital region rather than the extremities. This patient's presentation is consistent with Turner syndrome, in which edema of the hands and feet is caused by a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Impaired protein synthesis","explanation":"Impaired protein synthesis (e.g., in liver disease) can lead to decreased intravascular oncotic pressure and subsequent accumulation of fluid in the extracellular space. However, fluid primarily builds up in the peritoneal cavity in the form of ascites, rather than in the hands and feet.

This patient's presentation is consistent with Turner syndrome, in which edema of the hands and feet is caused by a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Impaired left ventricular function","explanation":"Impaired left ventricular (LV) function can cause increased hydrostatic pressure and subsequent edema via two main mechanisms: increased renal sodium retention (as a response to decreased renal perfusion) and increased venous pressure. This newborn has a systolic murmur that suggests a bicuspid aortic valve, which could progress to aortic stenosis or insufficiency and cause left-sided heart failure (LHF). However, LHF typically manifests with signs of pulmonary (e.g., tachypnea, basilar rales) rather than peripheral edema. Furthermore, this patient's presentation is consistent with Turner syndrome, in which edema of the hands and feet is caused by a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased capillary permeability","explanation":"Increased capillary permeability (e.g., due to inflammation, burns, allergic reactions) can lead to extravasation of fluid into the tissue and subsequent edema. However, edema is usually localized to the area of tissue injury or generalized in systemic reactions (e.g., sepsis, anaphylaxis). Peripheral edema of the hands and feet bilaterally would be untypical. Furthermore, this patient shows no symptoms of localized tissue damage such as erythema, and her normal vital signs make a systemic reaction unlikely. This patient's presentation is consistent with Turner syndrome, in which edema of the hands and feet is caused by a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Renal retention of sodium","explanation":"Renal retention of sodium can be a compensatory response to decreased kidney perfusion (resulting from, e.g., heart failure or chronic kidney disease) and can cause edema of the extremities. This patient's presentation is consistent with Turner syndrome, which is associated with both cardiovascular abnormalities (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve, hypertension) and kidney disease (e.g., horseshoe kidneys) that can progress to severe cardiac or renal insufficiency with consequent renal hypoperfusion. However, this child has no other signs and symptoms to suggest cardiac or renal insufficiency.

Nulliparity and early menarche are risk factors for this condition.","answers":[{"option":"Hysteroscopic myomectomy","explanation":"\nHysteroscopic myomectomy is the first-line treatment of submucosal fibroids. Large submucosal fibroids may prevent nidation or increase the risk of miscarriage, and fibroid removal can improve the chances of a successful pregnancy. Hysteroscopic myomectomy can be performed as a minimally invasive outpatient procedure that poses a low risk to future fertility and provides rapid relief of symptoms. In patients who do not desire surgery or in whom surgery is contraindicated, medical management with combined oral contraceptives or progestin-releasing IUD is recommended.

However, GnRH agonists are prescribed as second-line treatment options for patients with large and/or multiple fibroids who do not desire fertility and are typically used in preparation 2–3 months prior to surgery. GnRH agonists lead to a reduction in the size of uterine leiomyomas, decrease surgical time, speed up postoperative recovery, and may even enable a vaginal hysterectomy (which typically causes less blood loss than abdominal hysterectomy). GnRH agonists are not suited for long-term monotherapy because they can cause osteoporosis, hot flushes, and/or depression.","bool":false},{"option":"Uterine artery embolization","explanation":"\nUterine artery embolization (UAE) is an effective and minimally invasive procedure aimed at reducing heavy menstrual bleeding and pain associated with fibroids. However, UAE is associated with adverse effects such as early menopause, an increased risk for subsequent hysterectomy, the vaginal passage of fibroids, and possible reduction of fertility. UAE is therefore only considered for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids in women who do not desire fertility and who do not respond to first-line management.","bool":false},{"option":"Endometrial ablation","explanation":"\nEndometrial ablation is considered a third-line treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding in patients with leiomyomas who do not wish to get pregnant.

Like the endometrium in the uterine cavity, this tissue reacts to the hormone cycle, proliferating under the influence of estrogen. Patients typically present with abdominal pain that worsens with the onset of menses. Depending on the location of the endometrial tissue, most likely rectovaginal in this case, symptoms such as diarrhea, dyschezia, and hematochezia can also occur.\nPatients with endometriosis are usually treated with NSAIDs and continuous hormonal contraceptives.

However, D&amp;C is not commonly performed for this indication because there are less invasive methods of tissue sampling available. Moreover, this patient's diagnosis was already confirmed on endometrial biopsy, so additional endometrial sampling is not necessary.","bool":false},{"option":"Combined estrogen and progesterone therapy","explanation":"\nCombined oral contraceptive therapy (COCP) is a treatment option for some types of abnormal uterine bleeding. However, this patient's bleeding is most likely due to endometrial cancer, for which COCP therapy is not generally recommended.

Physical examination shows a soft, enlarged, and boggy uterus. Despite bimanual uterine massage, administration of uterotonic drugs, and placement of an intrauterine balloon for tamponade, the bleeding continues. A hysterectomy is performed. Vessels running through which of the following structures must be ligated during the surgery to achieve hemostasis?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The uterine artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery, supplies blood to the uterus. It runs through a structure located at the base of the broad ligament of the uterus.","answers":[{"option":"Cardinal ligament","explanation":"The cardinal ligament (transverse cervical ligament) connects the cervix with the lateral pelvic wall, providing support to the uterus. It contains the uterine artery, which is the main blood supply of the uterus. Ligation of the uterine vessels is imperative to perform hysterectomy and obtain hemostasis in this patient. During hysterectomy, the ureters are at increased risk for injury due to their proximity to the cardinal ligament.\nUterine atony (as evidenced by the soft, boggy uterus in this patient) is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage and occurs when the myometrial fibers of the uterus fail to fully contract and compress the uteroplacental vasculature (branches of the uterine artery) after placental delivery. Patients with a history of multiple pregnancies are at increased risk.","bool":true},{"option":"Ovarian ligament","explanation":"The ovarian ligament connects the uterus and ovaries. The ovarian branch of the uterine artery runs along the lower border of the ovarian ligament, but this vessel has no role in postpartum hemorrhage.","bool":false},{"option":"Round ligament","explanation":"The round ligament connects the uterine fundus to the labia majora. It contains the Sampson artery, which is a small, insignificant vessel that anastomoses with the uterine and ovarian arteries. Although the round ligaments would be ligated during a hysterectomy, their ligation will not contribute to achieving hemostasis in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Suspensory ligament","explanation":"The suspensory ligament of the ovary (infundibulopelvic ligament) attaches the ovary to the lateral pelvic wall. The ovarian vessels travel through this ligament to supply the ovaries and the upper part of the uterus. To achieve rapid hemostasis, the ligament containing the uterine arteries (main blood supply to the uterus) should first be ligated. Because this patient is young, the ovarian vessels and ovaries should ideally be preserved during hysterectomy to avoid premature menopause.","bool":false},{"option":"Uterosacral ligament","explanation":"The uterosacral ligaments are avascular fibrous bands that connect the cervix to the sacrum, thereby providing mechanical support to the uterus.

Which of the following changes is most likely to occur in this patient's condition?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This 47-year-old patient presents with irregular menses, night sweats, insomnia, and vulvovaginal atrophy, which are all signs and symptoms of menopause. The median age at onset of menopause in the United States is 51, but smoking is associated with earlier onset of symptoms.","answers":[{"option":"Increased follicle-stimulating hormone","explanation":"Increased levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are most likely to be seen in this patient. Menopause is usually preceded by the climacteric period, in which the menstrual cycles become increasingly irregular before amenorrhea begins. Ovarian failure leads to a decrease in the circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone, resulting in a decrease in negative feedback to the hypothalamus. This results in an increase in GnRH levels and subsequent increase in FSH.\nDue to the wide variability of FSH levels in women, it is no longer routinely tested to diagnose menopause, which is instead determined on a clinical basis.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased estrogen","explanation":"\nEstrogen levels often fluctuate during perimenopause but are more likely to be decreased, not increased, due to declining ovarian function. At menopause, ovarian production of estrogen ceases completely due to ovarian failure. After menopause, the majority of estrogen is derived from the peripheral conversion of testosterone via aromatase. Obese patients may have milder symptoms, as adipose tissue contains higher concentrations of aromatase.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased luteinizing hormone","explanation":"An increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) would be seen during menopause rather than a decrease. Ovarian failure leads to a decrease in the circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone, resulting in a decrease in negative feedback to the hypothalamus, and a subsequent increase in LH.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased gonadotropin-releasing hormone","explanation":"An increase rather than a decrease in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) would be seen during menopause because menopause disrupts the pituitary-hypothalamic feedback mechanism. Low GnRH levels are seen, e.g., in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which may be congenital (Kallmann syndrome) or seen in secondary amenorrhea (excessive exercise, stress, reduced caloric intake etc.).","bool":false},{"option":"Increased testosterone","explanation":"\nTestosterone levels during menopause are typically normal not increased. Increased testosterone can be a cause of anovulation and amenorrhea in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), but this patient has no signs of hirsutism or an adnexal mass on pelvic exam, making PCOS an unlikely diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased inhibin B","explanation":"\nInhibin B is secreted by ovarian granulosa cells.

Menarche was at the age of 10 years and her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. She does not have any children. Current medications include omeprazole and levothyroxine. Abdominal examination shows shifting dullness. There is tenderness to palpation of the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound. Bimanual palpation shows a small uterus and a right adnexal mass. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient presents with fatigue, ascites, weight loss, and an adnexal mass, all of which are suggestive of advanced ovarian cancer. An important risk factor for this condition is an elevated number of lifetime ovulations due to nulliparity, early menarche, and late menopause.","answers":[{"option":"Elevated serum CA-125 level","explanation":"In patients with an adnexal mass and symptoms of advanced ovarian cancer, serum CA-125 can be used as a tumor marker for malignant ovarian epithelial cell cancer. This marker should be used in conjunction with transvaginal ultrasound to assess the size and characteristics of the adnexal mass. In patients with a high probability of ovarian cancer, surgical evaluation should follow for a conclusive diagnosis. After diagnosis and initiation of treatment for ovarian cancer, CA-125 levels can be used as a prognostic marker and for the assessment of treatment response.\nSerum CA-125 levels are not used for screening in asymptomatic individuals at average risk because of limited sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. Elevated serum CA-125 levels can be caused by other types of cancer (e.g., endometrial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, lung cancer) and, especially in premenopausal women, by a number of benign causes (e.g., endometriosis, pregnancy).","bool":true},{"option":"Cervical dysplasia on Pap smear","explanation":"\nCervical dysplasia found on screening Pap smear is associated with subsequent development of cervical cancer. Early cervical cancer is usually asymptomatic, but late cervical cancer is associated with vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during intercourse, none of which this patient has. Ovarian cancer does not cause cervical dysplasia.\nThis patient's last Pap smear revealed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Given the negative HPV test, her risk for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is very low (&lt; 2%).","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated serum beta-hCG level","explanation":"Elevated β-hCG levels in a patient with typical symptoms of ovarian cancer are consistent with certain malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (e.g., dysgerminomas, nongestational choriocarcinomas), which primarily affect female individuals aged 10–30 years. Epithelial ovarian cancer, which is more likely in this postmenopausal patient, does not cause elevated serum β-hCG levels.","bool":false},{"option":"Prolonged prothrombin time","explanation":"Prolonged prothrombin time is typically seen in patients with impaired production of clotting factor VII due to severe hepatic impairment (e.g., in advanced cirrhosis). Hepatic impairment in ovarian cancer may be seen in cases of advanced hepatic metastasis. However, other symptoms of hepatic injury (e.g., jaundice, palmar erythema) would be expected and metastatic dissemination usually starts with solitary liver nodes that would not cause hepatic impairment.\nThe finding of ascites in patients with ovarian cancer is typically a result of fluid production of tumor cells in the intraabdominal cavity with obstruction of fluid reuptake due to peritoneal metastasis. Ascites in ovarian cancer is usually not the result of reduced oncotic pressure due to impaired hepatic production of proteins (which is the mechanism of ascites in liver cirrhosis).\n","bool":false},{"option":"Chocolate cyst of the right ovary","explanation":"\nChocolate cysts or ovarian endometriomas can form when menstrual debris builds up over time due to endometriosis. Although endometriomas may manifest with an adnexal mass similar to what is seen in this patient, they usually affect premenopausal women. Furthermore, pain is a common feature in patients with endometriosis but is absent in this patient. Instead, there are symptoms of weight loss and ascites, which, especially in the context of an adnexal mass, are more concerning for ovarian cancer.","bool":false},{"option":"Proliferation of endometrial glands","explanation":"Excessive proliferation of the endometrial glands can be seen in endometrial cancer, which typically affects postmenopausal women with a history of prolonged estrogen exposure (e.g., due to nulliparity). However, the characteristic manifestation of endometrial cancer is vaginal bleeding. In addition, endometrial cancer is usually not associated with an adnexal mass.\nHyperproliferation of the endometrium may also be seen in estrogen-producing sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary (i.e., granulosa cell tumors or theca cell tumors). However, these tumors are very rare and other symptoms of hyperestrogenism are also expected, such as postmenopausal vaginal bleeding or breast tenderness.

A lipid panel and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should therefore be performed at the time of diagnosis of PCOS. If an OGTT cannot be performed, fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1C may be measured instead. An assessment for obstructive sleep apnea should also be performed in addition to calculating BMI and measuring blood pressure. Patients should also be screened for anxiety, depression, and psychosexual dysfunction.\nTransvaginal ultrasound may be performed to identify cystic follicles and assess ovarian volume but is not required to establish the diagnosis of PCOS if ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism are present.","bool":true},{"option":"Liver disease","explanation":"The risk for developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is thought to be increased in patients with PCOS; however, there is a lack of consensus in the guidelines regarding screening for NAFLD in patients with increased risk.

The main risk factor for ovarian torsion is ovarian enlargement due to ectopic pregnancy, tumors, or cysts. Women of reproductive age are most commonly affected. Laparoscopic evaluation confirms the diagnosis. Surgical detorsion with ovarian conservation is recommended if ovaries are viable. If the ovaries are necrotic or malignancy is suspected, salpingo-oophorectomy should be performed.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased ovarian blood flow on Doppler","explanation":"Increased ovarian blood flow on Doppler ultrasound may be seen in vascularized malignant ovarian cancer, which may also cause abdominal pain. However, pain typically only occurs in advanced stages when cancer cachexia, ascites, and large abdominal or pelvic masses increase abdominal girth. Moreover, this patient is far younger than the typical age group at risk of ovarian cancer (peak incidence: 60–70 years), and she presents with acute abdominal pain and guarding.","bool":false},{"option":"Echogenic tubal ring","explanation":"A tubal ring sign is suggestive of tubal ectopic pregnancy (EP), which can also manifest with pelvic pain, guarding, and nausea.

As a result, the uterus, cervix, and upper third of the vagina are atretic. Patients are asymptomatic until puberty when they present with primary amenorrhea. The secondary sexual characteristics are usually normal since the gonads are functional and the patient has a normal female karyotype. The treatment is primarily surgical, involving uterine transplantation and vaginoplasty.","bool":true},{"option":"Androgen insensitivity","explanation":"Patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome present with primary amenorrhea, a blind vaginal pouch, an absent uterus on ultrasonography, and normal breast development. However, patients would not have pubic hair, since the growth of pubic hair is dependent on androgens. Ultrasonography would reveal undescended testicles.","bool":false},{"option":"17-alpha hydroxylase deficiency","explanation":"A deficiency of 17-alpha hydroxylase results in a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia that may manifest with primary amenorrhea in females as a result of impaired estrogen synthesis. However, a uterus would be present on ultrasonography and external genitalia would be normal. Pubic hair would be scarce due to hypoandrogenism, and breast development would be delayed. Patients would also have other clinical features such as hypertension and hyperpigmentation.","bool":false},{"option":"5-alpha reductase deficiency","explanation":"\n5-alpha-reductase deficiency may present with primary amenorrhea, a blind vaginal loop, and an absent uterus on ultrasonography.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient presents with an irregularly enlarged uterus, heavy, regular menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and, presumably, infertility (no prior pregnancy despite being sexually active and not using contraception). This constellation of features suggests uterine leiomyomas.","answers":[{"option":"Pelvic ultrasound ","explanation":"\nPelvic ultrasound is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis of uterine leiomyomas. Leiomyomas appear as concentric, hypoechoic, heterogeneous masses on ultrasound. The presence of calcifications or cystic areas suggests necrosis. Submucosal leiomyomas are most frequently associated with significantly prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, which is believed to be due to the increased total surface area as a result of the bulging uterine wall, impaired endometrial wall contractility, and/or vascular abnormalities. Pelvic discomfort may be due to the increased menstrual bleeding (manifesting as dysmenorrhea) or the mass effect of the tumors. In addition, uterine leiomyomas may cause obstruction of the uterine cavity, resulting in difficulty conceiving.\nAfter confirmation of the diagnosis, medical treatment, including hormone therapy, NSAIDs, and, possibly, antifibrinolytics, is indicated in symptomatic patients. Hormone therapy (e.g., with GnRH agonists) focuses on reducing estrogen levels and increasing progesterone levels.","bool":true},{"option":"Laparoscopy","explanation":"\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is performed in patients with clinical findings suggestive of endometriosis.

While pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility could be explained by endometriosis, the uterus is usually normal in size and would not appear irregular on bimanual examination.","bool":false},{"option":"Colposcopy with cervical cultures","explanation":"\nColposcopy with cervical cultures is indicated if an infection of the cervix (e.g., with Neisseria gonorrhea and/or Chlamydia trachomatis) is suspected. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) due to these pathogens may result in pelvic pain and menorrhagia, and this patient's sexual history puts her at risk. However, the absence of fever, cervical motion tenderness, and abnormal vaginal/cervical discharge make PID unlikely. Furthermore, an irregularly enlarged uterus cannot be explained by PID.","bool":false},{"option":"Dilation and curettage","explanation":"\nDilation and curettage is indicated for the definitive diagnosis of hydatidiform moles, choriocarcinoma, and endometrial cancer. Vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and an enlarged uterus (size greater than normal for gestational age) would be expected in a patient with hydatidiform mole, although β-HCG levels would be significantly increased. The β-HCG levels are also increased in choriocarcinoma. Moreover, the typical features of this malignancy (e.g., vaginal bleeding and inadequate uterine regression) usually occur following a delivery. Lastly, endometrial cancer typically presents with abnormal uterine bleeding and, in later stages, pelvic pain and an enlarged uterus, as seen in this patient. Nulliparity is a risk factor. However, endometrial cancer most commonly occurs in women 60–70 years of age and is therefore unlikely in this young patient.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Pelvic MRI","explanation":"\nMRI is not the initial test of choice for visualizing uterine leiomyomas but can be used to evaluate the uterus and ovaries for potentially complicated surgical cases and to rule out differential diagnoses, such as adenomyosis. Adenomyosis typically presents with menorrhagia, chronic pelvic pain, and uterine enlargement. However, in contrast to uterine leiomyomas, adenomyosis is associated with multiparity, not nulliparity, and the enlargement of the uterus would be uniform rather than irregular.","bool":false},{"option":"Non-contrast pelvic CT scan","explanation":"\nLeiomyomas may be visible on pelvic CT scans, but they are usually not easily distinguished from normal myometrial tissue, especially if they are not calcified. However, leiomyomas, and especially calcified ones, become more visible with contrast. A CT scan of the pelvis may be indicated for the staging of pelvic organ tumors. This patient's diagnosis should first be confirmed with a more simple test before further diagnostic steps are considered.","bool":false},{"option":"Repeat β-HCG test","explanation":"A uterus consistent in size with a 5-week gestation in a patient who is sexually active and does not use contraception raises concern for pregnancy. Although her last menses ended 5 days ago, a β-HCG test is essential in this case, because vaginal bleeding is common during the first trimester of pregnancy and may mimic a regular period.

Therefore, desensitization to penicillin should be performed in all patients with penicillin allergies who are diagnosed with syphilis during pregnancy. The process of desensitization can be safely performed during pregnancy and does not adversely affect the pregnancy outcome. In conditions for which there are no acceptable alternate drugs, desensitization allows the drug of choice to be used and the complications associated with untreated infection to be avoided (in this case, transplacental infection of the fetus).\nPenicillin allergies are reported in up to 10% of patients. However, reactions are not always due to hypersensitivity, and severe allergic reactions to penicillin are rare; approx. 85–90% of patients with a reported allergy will tolerate penicillin. An allergy evaluation should be conducted in patients with any history suggesting an allergy. It should include an epicutaneous (prick) test and, if the epicutaneous test is negative, an intradermal test. However, in patients with conditions that can only be treated with penicillin, a possible history of an allergic reaction qualifies the patient for desensitization even if allergy evaluation is not possible or if it delays the required treatment. Desensitization should be initiated (regardless of the allergen test report) because allergen tests are known to have poor sensitivity, and the risk of anaphylaxis is too great to rely on a single allergen test report.\n\n\n\n\n","bool":true},{"option":"Perform oral penicillin challenge test","explanation":"An oral penicillin graded challenge test would be the appropriate next step in a patient with a negative penicillin skin test, which suggests the patient may not have an allergy to penicillin.

Microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen from the breast mass shows disorganized nests of glandular cells that express E-cadherin and are surrounded by fibrous tissue. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":5,"hint":"Dimpling (puckering) of the skin overlying the breast mass indicates tightening and shortening of the suspensory ligaments (Cooper ligaments) as a result of tumor infiltration.","answers":[{"option":"Invasive ductal carcinoma","explanation":"\nDisorganized cords and nests of duct-like, glandular cells surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma are characteristic histological findings seen in invasive ductal carcinoma, which is the most common type of invasive breast cancer. Invasive carcinomas can manifest with a palpable breast mass and features of tumor infiltration (e.g., skin dimpling). Unlike in lobular carcinomas, tumor cells of ductal carcinomas often retain E-cadherin expression. The mammography finding of a stellate lesion occurs as a result of clustered microcalcifications of the surrounding tissue.","bool":true},{"option":"Invasive lobular carcinoma","explanation":"An invasive lobular carcinoma, which is the second most common type of invasive breast carcinoma, can manifest with a palpable breast mass and calcifications on mammography. However, a biopsy would show orderly rows of monomorphic neoplastic cells in a “single file” pattern without duct formation. In addition, a desmoplastic (fibrous) response is often absent and tumor cells of invasive lobular carcinomas typically lose their ability to express E-cadherin.","bool":false},{"option":"Lobular carcinoma-in-situ","explanation":"Lobular carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) is usually an incidental biopsy finding. A lobular CIS would not cause a breast mass or calcifications on mammography, and tumor cells of lobular CIS typically lose their ability to express E-cadherin.","bool":false},{"option":"Inflammatory breast cancer","explanation":"\nInflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive form of invasive breast cancer that classically manifests with an erythematous tender breast, peau d'orange appearance (due to dermal lymphatic invasion), and breast engorgement rather than a palpable breast mass.

This patient, however, does not have a rash, and calcifications in a star-shaped formation on mammography are not consistent with this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Fibroadenoma","explanation":"A fibroadenoma, which is the most common benign breast tumor in women, can manifest with a solitary, well-defined, nontender mass and evidence of fibrous and glandular tissue overgrowth on biopsy. However, as a benign condition, fibroadenoma is not associated with dimpling of the skin. Also, while fibroadenoma may show popcorn calcifications, calcifications in a star-shaped formation on mammography are not consistent with this diagnosis. Instead, a fibroadenoma usually appears as a smooth, polylobulated mass on mammography.","bool":false}]},{"id":200,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she frequently experiences cramping and pain in her legs during school sports.

These features are consistent with Turner syndrome.","answers":[{"option":"Osteoporosis","explanation":"\nOvarian dysgenesis is one of the most common features of Turner syndrome. Since the ovaries are the predominant source of estrogen, many patients with Turner syndrome are estrogen deficient, which results in increased osteoclast activity, decreased osteoblast activity, and bone reabsorption. Patients with Turner syndrome are therefore at increased risk for osteoporosis and pathologic fractures. Almost all patients with Turner syndrome require exogenous estrogen and progesterone replacement to prevent complications of sex hormone deficiency.\nLaboratory studies in patients with untreated Turner syndrome show hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, i.e. low estrogen, high follicle stimulating hormone, and high luteinizing hormone.","bool":true},{"option":"Pulmonary stenosis","explanation":"\nPulmonary stenosis is one of the classic cardiac defects seen in patients with Noonan syndrome.

FHA is due to a dysfunction in the pulsatile secretion of GnRH. In patients with FHA, the most important aspect of treatment is reaching normal levels of energy balance. This patient should, therefore, be counseled on making both dietary and exercise changes to increase her BMI and/or fat mass. The underlying cause (e.g., stress) of FHA should also be addressed. In women who are planning pregnancy and have a BMI over 18.5 kg/m2, pulsatile GnRH injections can be administered to increase FSH and LH levels and thereby stimulate ovulation.","bool":true},{"option":"Offer clomiphene citrate therapy","explanation":"\nClomiphene citrate is primarily used to treat women with oligoovulation or anovulation due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Clomiphene citrate stimulates ovulation by inhibiting the negative feedback of endogenous estrogen on the hypothalamus, thereby increasing the secretion of FSH and LH. This patient does not have any features of PCOS (e.g., hirsutism, ovarian cysts). Her secondary amenorrhea, infertility, vaginal dryness, and low levels of FSH and LH are suggestive of FHA, for which clomiphene is only recommended if first-line therapy is unsuccessful.","bool":false},{"option":"Reassess serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin in one week","explanation":"The serum beta-hCG test is a quantitative pregnancy test with high sensitivity that can detect pregnancy ∼ 6–9 days after fertilization.

The ectopic endometrial tissue induces hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the surrounding myometrium and results in a symmetrically enlarged uterus similar to a uterus in pregnancy. Secretions from ectopic glands within the myometrium cause pain and cramping, which become worse during menses.\nThe definitive diagnosis of adenomyosis requires histopathologic examination of a hysterectomy specimen, and although the diagnosis could be further supported by MRI and uterine biopsy, these tools would not provide any extra benefits for treatment.

Certain chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil) have a low risk profile and can be used in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Chemotherapy should be discontinued 3–4 weeks before delivery to reduce the risk of complications (e.g., transient neonatal myelosuppression, bleeding, sepsis) during childbirth and in the postpartum period.\nA 3–6 month delay in chemotherapy is associated with less favorable outcomes in nonpregnant individuals.

This condition most commonly occurs in postmenopausal women (mean age at diagnosis is 60 years) and patients typically present with abnormal uterine bleeding, symptoms of mass effect (e.g., pelvic pain or discomfort, constipation), increased abdominal girth, and an irregularly enlarged uterus on physical examination. Because of its estrogenic effect on the uterus, tamoxifen may stimulate the proliferation of the myometrium, with consequent development of uterine leiomyosarcomas, especially in postmenopausal women. Benign uterine leiomyomas may have a similar manifestation and are far more common than uterine sarcomas, so a biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. (See table \"Differential diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma”)\nUterine leiomyosarcoma has an aggressive course and is associated with a poor prognosis, regardless of the stage at which it is diagnosed.

Furthermore, FSH, LH, and testosterone would be elevated, which is not the case in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Adverse effect of medication","explanation":"\nRisperidone, which is an atypical antipsychotic, can cause hyperprolactinemia. High levels of prolactin suppress the hypothalamic secretion of GnRH, resulting in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

If OGTT is normal, a follow-up test (fasting glucose, HbA1c, or OGTT) should be performed every 3 years. In addition, healthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g., regular exercise, healthy diet, and weight loss) should be discussed. If the fasting serum glucose level is &gt; 126 mg/dL after delivery or serum glucose level is ≥ 200 mg/dL 2 hours after the postpartum OGTT, T2DM can be diagnosed and should be treated accordingly.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The cervical motion tenderness and friable cervix in this patient suggest cervicitis.","answers":[{"option":"Chlamydia infection","explanation":"Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the most common cause of cervicitis. Clinical features of this condition include purulent and/or bloody vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and postcoital bleeding. Bimanual examination typically shows cervical motion tenderness, while pelvic examination reveals an erythematous, edematous, friable cervix that bleeds upon contact. Cervicitis typically manifests without fever or abdominal pain (as opposed to infections with upper reproductive tract involvement such as pelvic inflammatory disease). This patient's history and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (unprotected intercourse, new sexual partner) make cervicitis due to a chlamydial infection the most likely diagnosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Cervical dysplasia","explanation":"\nCervical dysplasia, also referred to as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, is a precursor to cervical cancer and is strongly associated with HPV infections. Early disease stages are usually asymptomatic, while more advanced disease manifests with abnormal vaginal bleeding (e.g., postcoital bleeding), blood-stained or purulent discharge, and hydronephrosis if tumor growth compresses the ureters. While this patient has an increased risk of contracting HPV (no HPV vaccination, unprotected intercourse with a new partner), the development of cervical dysplasia within a year of her last normal Pap smear is unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Early uterine pregnancy","explanation":"Although early uterine pregnancy may manifest with slight vaginal bleeding, other typical features (e.g., amenorrhea, nausea/vomiting, breast enlargement, fatigue) are absent in this patient. She also lacks pregnancy-typical changes of the cervix on physical examination, including initial softening, increased blood flow, and production of a clear, viscous mucus. Friability and easy bleeding of the cervix are indicative of a different underlying condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Cervix trauma","explanation":"Trauma to the cervix can be due to several causes, including insertion of tampons or cervical caps, diaphragms or intrauterine devices, and vigorous sexual intercourse. While cervix trauma also manifests with vaginal bleeding and is often painful, it is not the most common cause of this patient's symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Endometriosis","explanation":"The main clinical features of endometriosis include chronic pelvic pain that worsens just before menstruation, dysmenorrhea, premenstrual, or postmenstrual bleeding, and during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). While endometriosis can spread to the cervix and cause postcoital bleeding, it is associated with dysmenorrhea and menstrual cycle irregularities and, therefore, unlikely in this case.","bool":false},{"option":"Ectopic pregnancy","explanation":"An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg attaches outside of the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tubes. Lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and cervical motion tenderness are common symptoms. Although this patient does not take her oral contraceptive consistently and could be pregnant, vaginal discharge and postcoital pain are indicative of a different cause.","bool":false},{"option":"Breakthrough bleeding","explanation":"\nBreakthrough bleeding is the term for bleeding that occurs mid-cycle, and most commonly occurs in women who use combined oral contraceptives, particularly within the first few months after starting treatment. Since this patient occasionally forgets to take her contraceptive medication, breakthrough bleeding is possible. However, breakthrough bleeding is usually painless and not accompanied by pathological findings on physical examination.","bool":false},{"option":"Uterine leiomyomas","explanation":"\nUterine leiomyomas are benign neoplasms often seen in women with a history of nulliparity and early menarche.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's skin findings?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This woman has invasive carcinoma of the breast. The diffuse erythema, edema, and pitting of the skin suggest peau d'orange (skin resembling an orange peel), which supports the diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer.","answers":[{"option":"Obstruction of the lymphatic channels","explanation":"\nObstruction of the dermal lymphatics by malignant tumor cells in inflammatory breast cancer results in localized lymphedema, which manifests as an increase in the size of the breast and the characteristic swollen and pitted appearance of peau d'orange (prominent hair follicle pits). Further signs include itching and nipple retraction. Even with trimodality therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and radical mastectomy) the prognosis is poor, as inflammatory breast cancer spreads early.","bool":true},{"option":"Bacterial invasion of the subcutaneous tissue","explanation":"Bacterial invasion of the subcutaneous tissue of the breast causes mastitis, which can manifest as pain, erythema, and edema of the breast. Although peau d'orange appearance may occasionally be seen, most patients with mastitis will have fever, be actively lactating, or have a recent history of penetrating trauma that incited the infection. This patient has histopathological evidence that the signs are secondary to an invasive carcinoma of the breast.","bool":false},{"option":"Tightening of the suspensory ligaments","explanation":"\nTumor infiltration of the breast may be associated with tightening and shortening of the suspensory ligaments (Cooper ligaments). Because these ligaments are attached to the skin, tightening results in localized retraction and dimpling of the skin that changes the normal shape and contour of the breast. It differs from the swelling and pitting of peau d'orange seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Involution of the breast parenchyma and ductal system","explanation":"\nInvolution of the breast parenchyma and ductal system occurs when the serum estrogen levels begin to decrease during menopause, causing the breasts to decrease in size.

Moreover, there are no other features in this patient that suggest immunocompromise, which is typical of HIV.","bool":false}]},{"id":217,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of excessive hair growth on her cheeks, chin, and upper lip. She also reports that her voice has become deeper, which she attributes to a recent upper respiratory tract infection. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated. She has no history of serious medical illness and her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. The last fetal ultrasonography, performed at 20 weeks' gestation, was unremarkable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hirsutism, facial acne, and patches of hyperpigmentation on the forehead and nose. Pelvic examination shows clitoromegaly. The uterus is consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows a live intrauterine pregnancy and 5-cm solid, multinodular ovarian masses bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient shows signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, deep voice, facial acne, clitoromegaly). The most likely underlying condition in this patient classically occurs during pregnancy.","answers":[{"option":"Luteomas","explanation":"\nLuteomas are rare, benign tumors that develop from androgen-producing lutein cells in response to elevated levels of β-hCG during pregnancy. Although the majority of patients are asymptomatic, these tumors can manifest with features of virilization, such as deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly, as seen in this patient. Larger luteomas can also result in mass-related features (e.g., obstructive uropathy) and an increased risk of developing ovarian torsion. Pelvic ultrasound typically shows unilateral or bilateral solid adnexal masses with a diameter of ≥ 4 cm and significant venous or arterial flow.\nLuteomas typically regress spontaneously post partum and management consists of monitoring and follow-up imaging. Surgery is sometimes performed in virilized women to limit further virilization (both maternal and fetal), signs of which are typically irreversible, and in patients with tumors &gt; 5 cm to prevent ovarian torsion. Urgent surgery is indicated in patients with features of ovarian torsion and/or mass-related symptoms.","bool":true},{"option":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","explanation":"\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can manifest with hirsutism, acne, and hyperpigmentation, all of which are seen here. However, PCOS does not usually lead to voice change or clitoromegaly, and the hyperpigmented lesions seen in PCOS are typically located in the axilla, groin, and/or neck (acanthosis nigricans). Moreover, multiple cystic lesions would be expected on pelvic ultrasonography rather than the solid, multinodular ovarian masses seen here. Finally, the onset of symptoms in PCOS typically occurs in adolescence.","bool":false},{"option":"Theca lutein cysts","explanation":"\nTheca lutein cysts can develop during pregnancy due to excessive amounts of circulating gonadotropins, such as β-hCG, and can manifest with features of hyperandrogenism, including virilization (e.g., voice deepening, clitoromegaly). However, while theca lutein cysts are typically bilateral, they appear as cystic lesions rather than solid masses on pelvic ultrasound.","bool":false},{"option":"Corpus luteum cysts","explanation":"\nCorpus luteum cysts are common in pregnancy but typically regress at the beginning of the second trimester. Moreover, corpus luteum cysts produce progesterone rather than androgens and, therefore, features of hyperandrogenism would not be expected. In addition, while corpus luteum cysts may have solid components, they typically appear as cystic lesions rather than solid masses on pelvic ultrasound.","bool":false},{"option":"Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors","explanation":"\nSertoli-Leydig cell tumors are rare, usually benign tumors that can occur during pregnancy and manifest with features of virilization (e.g., deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly). However, pelvic ultrasound typically shows a unilateral solid mass rather than bilateral lesions.","bool":false}]},{"id":218,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"An 18-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination one week after starting treatment with an oral antibiotic for uncomplicated cystitis. She has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and has not had her first menstrual period yet. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses condoms consistently. She is 140 cm (4 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 54 kg (119 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a broad chest, a low-set posterior hairline, and several pigmented nevi on her body. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis shows fusion of the kidneys at the lower poles, a small uterus, and fibrous ovaries. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":1,"hint":"Hypertension, short stature, low-set posterior hairline, shield chest, and numerous pigmented nevi in a patient with a history of primary amenorrhea suggests Turner syndrome. Horseshoe kidney and streak gonads, both of which are seen here, are common findings in individuals with this condition.","answers":[{"option":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","explanation":"\nTurner syndrome is associated with a variety of cardiac anomalies, most commonly bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta. Because these anomalies increase the risk of early death, regular cardiac assessment with cardiac MRI or transthoracic echocardiography is recommended to detect and monitor structural anomalies. Patients with Turner syndrome should also receive regular screening for other commonly associated conditions, such as hypertension, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.","bool":true},{"option":"Mammography","explanation":"\nMammography is used for the early detection of breast cancer. Individuals with Turner syndrome, which this patient most likely has, do not have an increased risk of developing breast cancer compared to the general population. Therefore, mammography is not indicated at this time.","bool":false},{"option":"Thyroid scintigraphy","explanation":"\nThyroid scintigraphy is used to evaluate thyroid nodules or detect ectopic thyroid tissue. Since patients with Turner syndrome have an increased risk of autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto thyroiditis), TSH and T4 levels should be regularly monitored. However, this patient has no history of thyroid nodules and thyroid scintigraphy is not indicated for monitoring thyroid function.","bool":false},{"option":"Nuclear bone scintigraphy","explanation":"\nNuclear bone scintigraphy is used to detect and evaluate bone injuries, joint conditions, and bone malignancies. Because patients with Turner syndrome have an increased risk of osteoporosis, periodic monitoring of bone mineral density (BMD) is indicated. However, BMD is monitored with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry rather than nuclear bone scintigraphy.","bool":false},{"option":"Renal biopsy","explanation":"\nRenal biopsy may be indicated in patients with suspected glomerulonephritis or unexplained acute kidney injury. Although Turner syndrome is commonly associated with congenital renal anomalies, such as horseshoe kidney, screening for these conditions is performed with renal ultrasonography. Renal biopsy is not currently indicated in this patient.","bool":false}]},{"id":219,"info":"Female Reproductive System and Breast","question":"A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a palpable mass in the left breast that she noticed 3 weeks ago. During this period, she has also had some left-sided blood-tinged nipple discharge. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. She has no children. The patient's menopause occurred at 57 years of age. Her mother died of colon cancer at the age of 65 years. The patient smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 15 years ago. She does not drink alcohol. Her current medications include enalapril, metformin, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (187 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m2. She appears well. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Examination of the breasts shows a left-sided single, nontender, firm mass with poorly defined margins in the upper outer quadrant. Biopsy of the mass confirms the diagnosis of pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) that is estrogen-receptor (ER) positive. The patient undergoes lumpectomy of the left breast and treatment with tamoxifen is started. The patient's therapy increases her risk of which of the following conditions?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient presents with LCIS, which is ER positive. She is treated with the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen, which has both agonist and antagonist effects on estrogen receptors in the body.","answers":[{"option":"Endometrial cancer","explanation":"\nLong-term exposure to increased estrogen levels is the most important risk factor for type I endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen is a SERM that has antagonist effects on the breast tissue (thus treating her ER-positive breast cancer), and estrogen agonist effects in the bone and uterine tissue. Studies have shown that postmenopausal women who take tamoxifen have a 2–3 times higher risk of developing endometrial cancer than an age-matched population.\nPrior to starting treatment with tamoxifen, this patient should be counseled regarding signs of endometrial hyperplasia, such as abnormal vaginal bleeding. It should be noted that this patient already has several risk factors for endometrial cancer, including nulliparity, late menopause, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, her history of smoking is actually a protective factor.","bool":true},{"option":"Osteoporosis","explanation":"Standard treatments for breast cancer such as adjuvant chemotherapy may increase bone loss through ovarian failure. In premenopausal women, taking tamoxifen could also cause a slight reduction in bone density and, potentially, osteoporosis. However, in post-menopausal women - like this patient, tamoxifen has an antagonistic effect on estrogen receptors in the breast tissue, and an agonist effect on bone and uterine tissue. Therefore, tamoxifen actually preserves bone mineral density and reduces the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.","bool":false},{"option":"Cardiotoxicity","explanation":"One of the serious adverse effects of trastuzumab, a breast cancer treatment drug, is cardiotoxicity (occurs in 2–7% of cases). Trastuzumab is used in patients who have breast cancer that is HER2-receptor positive. Although this patient has breast cancer, the hormone profiling of her nodule shows that the cancer is estrogen-receptor positive, so trastuzumab would not be the drug of choice. Tamoxifen, which this patient is taking, has no known associations with cardiotoxicity.","bool":false},{"option":"Myelosuppression","explanation":"\nMyelosuppression is a common adverse effect of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, but it is not a common adverse effect of tamoxifen therapy.","bool":false},{"option":"Ovarian cancer","explanation":"Although tamoxifen is not known to increase the risk of ovarian cancer, it does raise the risk for another gynecological malignancy because of its estrogen agonist effects in certain parts of the body.","bool":false}]}]
