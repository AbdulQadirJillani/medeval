This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?","difficulty":4,"hint":"Fever, headache, vomiting, and a stiff neck with positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs indicate meningitis. The appearance of gram-negative coccobacilli in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in an unvaccinated child indicates Haemophilus influenzae.","answers":[{"option":"Hearing loss","explanation":"Transient or permanent sensorineural hearing loss, which is an important complication of bacterial meningitis, may occur as early as 48 hours after the onset of symptoms as a result of the spread of infection from the meninges to the cochlea via the cochlear aqueduct. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), multiple episodes of splenic infarction cause atrophy and fibrosis of the spleen, and by the age of 3 years most patients would have functional asplenia which increases the risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria such as H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. The risk is further increased by the fact that the child has not received the Hib vaccine. Other common long-term neurological complications of bacterial meningitis include cognitive impairment, focal motor deficit (spasticity/paresis), and seizure disorders. Dexamethasone is recommended for children above 6 months of age with Hib meningitis because it has been shown to decrease the risk of hearing loss.\nSCD is also an independent risk factor for mild sensorineural hearing loss because it can cause vaso-occlusive crisis in the narrow labyrinthine artery and/or its branches.","bool":true},{"option":"Communicating hydrocephalus","explanation":"Postinfectious communicating hydrocephalus resulting from impaired reabsorption of CSF in the basal cisterns (due to obstruction of subarachnoid villi) is most often seen in patients with tuberculous (TB) meningitis. Although patients with TB meningitis may present with clinical features similar to those seen in patients with meningitis due to H. influenzae, TB meningitis typically has a subacute or chronic course, not an acute course. In addition, a Gram stain would not show gram-negative coccobacilli.

This procedure also helps identify and ligate the injured vessel. A delay in surgical treatment is associated with a worsening prognosis. This patient's rapid decline in consciousness (GCS is 8 following the CT scan), decrease in respiratory rate, and anisocoria suggest ongoing compression of the brain that should prompt immediate decompressive craniotomy.

This patient has an expanding epidural hematoma with imminent brain herniation, which warrants a more aggressive treatment approach.","bool":false},{"option":"Repeat head CT scan","explanation":"Nonsurgical management, which includes serial head CT scans and neurological observation, may be considered in experienced neurosurgical centers for patients with small acute epidural hematomas (hematoma volume &lt; 30 cm3) with a GCS &gt; 9, if focal neurological deficits (e.g., hemiplegia, cranial nerve palsy) are absent. This patient displays signs and symptoms of severely elevated intracranial pressure (anisocoria, decrease in respiratory rate) with imminent brain herniation. Urgent treatment is indicated to prevent further neurological deterioration, permanent brain damage, and death.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform burr hole evacuation","explanation":"Emergency hematoma evacuation through a burr hole may be used to treat acute epidural hematoma. However, it is only the second-line treatment because it does not always allow complete evacuation of the hematoma and/or ligation of the bleeding meningeal vessel. In centers with limited neurosurgical expertise, burr hole evacuation is an acceptable alternative, because it can be performed by general surgeons, but generally it is not the preferred surgical approach.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform lumbar puncture","explanation":"\nLumbar puncture (LP) is indicated in numerous neurological conditions, e.g., in patients suspected of subarachnoid hemorrhage with a negative CT.

PSP is characterized by oculomotor deficits such as vertical gaze palsy (due to atrophy of structures in the tectum of the midbrain), which can progress to complete supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Patients with PSP often have postural instability, which leads to gait impairment and frequent falls. Frontal lobe dysfunction can manifest with behavioral changes (e.g., apathy, disinhibition, impaired reasoning) and dementia (forgetfulness, social withdrawal, sundowning). Patients usually also present with parkinsonism (e.g., bradykinesia, rigor) and may develop features of pseudobulbar palsy such as dysarthria and dysphagia. The prognosis of PSP is generally poor and most patients die within 5–10 years of symptom onset.\nSee “Differential diagnoses of Parkinson-plus syndromes” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Normal pressure hydrocephalus","explanation":"\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) manifests with symptoms of cognitive disturbance (e.g., apathy, confusion) and gait impairment with a broad-based gait.

This patient's current symptoms and MRI findings indicate communicating hydrocephalus, which can be a complication of meningitis.","answers":[{"option":"Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations","explanation":"\nCSF drains from the 4th ventricle into the subarachnoid space and from the subarachnoid space into dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. The blockage of arachnoid granulations by degenerating neutrophils and proliferating fibroblasts (i.e., arachnoid scarring) is a complication of bacterial meningitis. This blockage results in the accumulation of CSF in the subarachnoid space and the ventricular spaces, the subsequent symmetric enlargement of the entire ventricular system (communicating hydrocephalus), and features of raised intracranial pressure (e.g., early-morning headaches, nausea, vomiting). Communicating hydrocephalus can also be a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage.","bool":true},{"option":"Compensatory enlargement of CSF spaces","explanation":"Compensatory enlargement of CSF spaces, which is seen in hydrocephalus ex vacuo, occurs secondary to loss of brain volume in neurodegenerative diseases or stroke. An MRI would show biventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space, as seen here. However, hydrocephalus ex vacuo does not cause any symptoms because it does not affect intracerebral pressure, and it is not typically seen in children.","bool":false},{"option":"Impaired CSF drainage into the fourth ventricle","explanation":"Impaired CSF drainage from the 3rd ventricle into the 4th ventricle is caused by obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, which can occur as a complication of bacterial meningitis and lead to bilateral ventricular enlargement, as seen here. However, obstructive hydrocephalus only causes dilation of the ventricles upstream of the obstruction, so the subarachnoid space would not be enlarged due to aqueductal stenosis. Enlargement of the subarachnoid space in this patient suggests a different pathological process.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased CSF production by the choroid plexus","explanation":"Increased CSF production by the choroid plexus is seen in choroid plexus papilloma, a rare benign pediatric tumor that can manifest with features of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, nausea, vomiting) as well as enlargement of both the ventricular and subarachnoid spaces (communicating hydrocephalus).

SAH requires rapid diagnosis and treatment because it can quickly cause death if bleeding persists. Any patient who presents with a sudden, severe headache must have SAH ruled out with a head CT scan.\nIf the head CT scan is negative for SAH, but clinical suspicion remains high, a lumbar puncture is indicated. A negative head CT scan and negative lumbar puncture rule out acute SAH. Analgesia, IV fluids, and seizure prophylaxis are initiated if SAH is diagnosed. Further treatment depends on the suspected cause of the hemorrhage.

While symptoms usually develop during the first 2 weeks of therapy, as seen in this patient, NMS may also develop after years of continuous therapy and without any associated increase of dose. Nonetheless, higher doses or switching antipsychotics are risk factors for the development of NMS.\nThe most important therapeutic measure is the discontinuation of the triggering substance.

They are, however, associated with the development of impulse control disorders (e.g., compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, excessive spending of money), which occurs in up to 50% of patients with long-term use. This adverse effect is presumably due to decreased neuronal activity in brain areas responsible for impulse and inhibitory control. Risk factors include high doses, long duration of treatment, young age, and male sex. Other common side effects of dopamine agonists include nausea, drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, confusion, and hallucinations.\nPatients may also develop compulsive use of these drugs (termed dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome).

Patients experience a symmetric cape-like distribution of pain and temperature sensory loss around the upper trunk, shoulders, and upper limbs. Vibration and position sense are selectively spared because fibers of the posterior columns decussate higher up in the medulla. As syringomyelia progresses, lower motor neuron weakness develops symmetrically in the upper limbs (evident by hand weakness, areflexia and fasciculations in this patient) because the fluid-filled cavity begins to compress the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord at the level of the lesion. As the lesion expands, patients develop an upper motor neuron palsy of the lower extremities and lower half of the trunk (due to involvement of the corticospinal tracts), as well as complete sensory loss below the level of the lesion (including loss of vibration and position sense). However, sensations around the sacral region will usually be spared.","bool":true},{"option":"Amytrophic lateral sclerosis","explanation":"\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may manifest with a combination of upper and lower motor neuron weakness that progresses over time.

Although this patient's sensory deficit and arm weakness may be explained by demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord and the medulla, MS is unlikely given this patient's lower motor neuron findings (e.g., fasciculations, loss of reflexes). In addition, unlike this patient's gradual progression, MS more typically manifests with a relapsing-remitting course (though in rare cases, may also be rapidly progressive).","bool":false},{"option":"Cervical disk prolapse","explanation":"Cervical disk prolapse can lead to nerve root compression (radiculopathy), which may manifest with paresthesias as well as sensory and/or motor deficits. However, neurological symptoms produced by disc prolapse are usually unilateral and localized to the distribution of the compressed nerve root. It is very unlikely that nerve root compression is the cause of this patient's symmetrical distribution of deficits; many nerve roots would have to be compressed simultaneously on both sides. In addition, all sensations are usually affected by nerve root compression, and the preservation of vibration and positional sense suggests a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Brown-Séquard syndrome","explanation":"\nBrown-Séquard syndrome, which results from a hemisection of the spinal cord, presents with dissociated sensory loss and unilateral motor deficits below the level of the injury.

Normal prion proteins (PrPc) are found on the surface of cortical neurons and are protective against free radicals. Misfolded proteins (PrPSc) have more beta-sheets in their secondary structures, thereby changing their conformation.

Patients with VD typically develop a stepwise decline in function (following each ischemic event), as well as focal deficits such as hemiparesis, unilateral visual field deficits, urinary incontinence, and behavioral changes. Although this patient does have risk factors for an ischemic event (e.g., older age, hypertension), the rapid, nonstepwise progression of her symptoms is not typical for VD.

More severe or continued exposure may result in hemolytic anemia along with renal and/or hepatic failure. This patient's symptoms include neuropsychiatric components and gingivobuccal inflammation, neither of which are expected in copper toxicity. Furthermore, penicillamine is the first-line treatment for copper toxicity; dimercaprol is used less frequently.","bool":false},{"option":"Cyanide","explanation":"\nCyanide intoxication manifests acutely as confusion, vertigo, headache, nausea, and vomiting, which can progress to seizures and coma in severe cases. Affected patients are initially hypertensive and tachycardic but then develop hypotension and bradycardia as peripheral oxygen delivery deteriorates. Chronic toxicity most often causes non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, chest pain, and headache. Neither acute nor chronic exposure cause gingivobuccal inflammation, tremor, or ataxia.

This patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on which of the following structures?","difficulty":1,"hint":"Chemotherapy induces nausea by acting on the chemoreceptor trigger zone, which responds to certain chemicals in the blood. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist that is especially effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.","answers":[{"option":"Area postrema","explanation":"The area postrema is an area of the medulla that contains the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and is one of the primary sites involved in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, along with the nucleus tractus solitarius. The area postrema of the brainstem has fenestrated capillaries, which allows input from substances in the blood such as drugs (e.g., chemotherapy) and/or hormones. Metoclopramide is a D2 dopamine receptor antagonist that acts primarily by inhibiting the vomiting centers of the area postrema.","bool":true},{"option":"Vagus nerve","explanation":"The vagus nerve carries afferent input from the gastrointestinal tract to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), which is part of the vomiting center of the medulla. The NTS responds to serotonin release from the GI tract, which sensitizes the vagus nerve and causes vomiting. This pathway is blocked both centrally and peripherally by serotonin receptor antagonists such as ondansetron and metoclopramide (at high doses). Chemotherapy-induced nausea occurs due to effects on a different structure.","bool":false},{"option":"Vestibular nerve","explanation":"The vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve sends input to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), which is part of the vomiting center of the medulla.

Atropine does not act on nicotinic cholinergic receptors and thus cannot treat symptoms of neuromuscular dysfunction, for which pralidoxime is still necessary. As oximes can lead to a transient worsening of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, these agents should only be administered after treatment with atropine has been initiated.\nThe mnemonic DUMBBELLSS (Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis/Muscle weakness, Bronchospasm, Bradycardia, Emesis, Lacrimation, Lethargy, Salivation, and Sweating) is helpful for remembering symptoms of acetylcholine excess.","bool":true},{"option":"Physostigmine","explanation":"\nPhysostigmine can be used as an antidote in atropine overdose or as a treatment for myasthenia gravis. However, it would exacerbate this patient's symptoms of acetylcholine excess by further increasing cholinergic stimulation.","bool":false},{"option":"Carbachol","explanation":"\nCarbachol directly binds to acetylcholine receptors of both muscarinic and nicotinic types and is used in the treatment of glaucoma. It would further exacerbate this patient's symptoms of acetylcholine excess and must be avoided in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Pancuronium","explanation":"\nPancuronium belongs to the class of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants that bind to acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which blocks nicotinic stimulation by acetylcholine. Even though administration of pancuronium would lead to a reversal of neuromuscular symptoms in this patient, muscular paralysis and possibly even respiratory impairment would result. The risks of pancuronium therefore outweigh its potential benefits, especially considering that safer alternatives are available.","bool":false},{"option":"Benztropine","explanation":"\nBenztropine is a selective antagonist of muscarinic receptors that particularly decreases cholinergic overactivity in the CNS. It is typically used to treat tremor in Parkinson disease and extrapyramidal symptoms caused by antipsychotics. However, since this patient's muscarinic symptoms have mostly resolved following the administration of atropine, an additional muscarinic inhibitor would not be particularly useful.","bool":false}]},{"id":62,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 77-year-old woman is brought to the physician for gradually increasing confusion and difficulty walking for the past 4 months. Her daughter is concerned because she has been forgetful and seems to be walking more slowly. She has been distracted during her weekly bridge games and her usual television shows. She has also had increasingly frequent episodes of urinary incontinence and now wears an adult diaper daily. She has hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Current medications include lisinopril and atorvastatin. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 139/83 mmHg. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls 2 out of 3 words immediately and 1 out of 3 after five minutes. She has a broad-based gait and takes short steps. Sensation is intact and muscle strength is 5/5 throughout. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient's confusion, gait apraxia, and urinary incontinence constitute the classic triad of a condition associated with reversible dementia in older adults.","answers":[{"option":"Normal pressure hydrocephalus","explanation":"\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) manifests with gait instability, cognitive disturbance, and urinary incontinence – the classic “wet, wacky, and wobbly” triad. Gait changes are typically symmetrical, while cognitive impairment primarily manifests as decreased attention span and concentration, without psychotic features that may be characteristic of other causes of dementia. (See table “Differential diagnosis of subtypes of dementia”).","bool":true},{"option":"Vitamin B12 deficiency","explanation":"\nVitamin B12 deficiency develops after years of inadequate intake, malabsorption, or increased demand. The condition can manifest with symptoms such as memory impairment, personality changes, and paresthesias, which could lead to incontinence and gait abnormalities. However, vitamin B12 deficiency typically results in loss of distal vibratory sense in the extremities (lower &gt; upper), and (megaloblastic) anemia is an expected finding on laboratory evaluation.","bool":false},{"option":"Vascular dementia","explanation":"\nRisk factors for vascular dementia include hypertension and dyslipidemia. Its clinical presentation is highly variable as different regions of the brain may be involved in the vascular insults that lead to cognitive deterioration. Symptoms can include gait disturbances, urinary frequency, personality and mood changes, and cognitive deficits, as well as cortical symptoms such as aphasia or amnesia. However, vascular dementia is associated clinically with the development of deficits in a stepwise manner, and not gradual development as in this patient. Moreover, exacerbations associated with vascular events may be clinically apparent, e.g., as unprovoked falls in the patient's history, or as signs of stroke on examination.","bool":false},{"option":"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease","explanation":"\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is characterized by progressive dementia and visual/cerebellar disturbances, which could be consistent with this patient's gait instability and memory impairment. However, CJD typically progresses very rapidly and is associated with additional symptoms of myoclonus (present in &gt; 90% of patients), pyramidal/extrapyramidal dysfunction, and akinetic mutism, all of which are absent in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Alzheimer disease","explanation":"\nAlzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia, with increasing prevalence after 60 years of age. Memory impairment is the cardinal and most common initial symptom, while behavioral symptoms, primitive reflexes, and urinary incontinence may present late in the disease course. The early development of urinary incontinence and gait disturbances in this patient is not typical of Alzheimer disease.","bool":false},{"option":"Frontotemporal dementia","explanation":"The hallmarks of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are early, progressive aphasia or behavior and personality changes (e.g., disinhibition, apathy, hyperorality, and compulsive behaviors), which occurs alongside degeneration of the frontal and/or temporal lobes. FTD typically presents on average during the fifth decade of life, making it a relatively common cause of early-onset dementia. While this patient's performance on the five-minute recall test generally raises suspicion for the presence of dementia, the lack of language dysfunction or personality changes, the patient's age, and the presence of gait abnormalities make FTD an unlikely diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Pseudodementia","explanation":"\nPseudodementia is characterized by cognitive deficits and memory impairment that may mimic dementia. It is important to consider in older patients, as cognitive deficits may resolve with treatment of the related psychiatric condition (most commonly depression). Although this patient has recent behavioral changes that may be interpreted as anhedonia, she has difficulty staying focused rather than decreased interest. This patient does not meet other criteria for major depression, and pseudodementia is not typically associated with gait disturbances or incontinence.","bool":false},{"option":"Dementia with Lewy-bodies","explanation":"\nDementia with Lewy-bodies (DLB) is characterized by early impairments in attention and executive function, with memory impairment developing later in the disease course. In addition, diagnosis requires two of the following: cognitive fluctuations (episodes of worse cognition and alertness interspersed with periods of relatively normal function), visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. While this patient demonstrates cognitive impairment and a slow gait with short steps, she does not have any other features of parkinsonism, e.g., tremor or rigidity. Also, the patient lacks visual hallucinations or cognitive fluctuations.","bool":false}]},{"id":63,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing weakness in both legs for 7 days. She also reports a tingling sensation in her legs that is exacerbated by taking a hot shower. She is sexually active with one male partner and does not use condoms.

Patellar reflex is 4+ bilaterally and plantar reflex shows an extensor response on both sides. Abdominal reflex is absent. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following findings is most likely to further support the diagnosis in this patient?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient presents with lower leg weakness, tingling sensation exacerbated by hot shower (Uhthoff phenomenon), hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign, and an absent abdominal reflex. All of these, especially in a woman of childbearing age, suggest multiple sclerosis (MS). The MRI image shows periventricular hyperintensities (T2 weighted), suggestive of demyelination.","answers":[{"option":"Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation","explanation":"The presence of immunoglobulin bands (particularly oligoclonal bands) and increased IgG production in the CSF are highly sensitive, but nonspecific, findings that support the diagnosis of MS. Lumbar puncture is indicated for patients with suspected MS who have inconclusive clinical and MRI findings. The production of multiple, nonspecific clones of IgG within the CNS is a result of intrathecal inflammation.","bool":true},{"option":"Positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum","explanation":"Positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum (positive rapid plasma reagin test) is a nonspecific finding in patients with syphilis. The RPR test is used to screen for syphilis as well as evaluate disease activity and monitor treatment response. Although tertiary syphilis can manifest with various neurological symptoms (neurosyphilis), it usually progresses slowly and would not be expected to show periventricular hyperintensities on MRI of the brain, as seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy","explanation":"A finding of oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy is the hallmark of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to JC virus infection. PML causes progressive neurological degeneration that can mimic multiple sclerosis. Diffusion-weighted MRI images would typically show asymmetric hyperintense lesions. However, PML is most commonly associated with AIDS, which this patient has no evidence of.","bool":false},{"option":"Identification of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture","explanation":"Identification of gram-positive cocci (GPC) in groups on blood culture would not be seen in this patient who has no signs or symptoms of sepsis (e.g., fever, chills, hypotension). In addition, her neurological symptoms and imaging cannot be explained by sepsis.","bool":false},{"option":"Detection of high-affinity antibodies to dsDNA in the serum","explanation":"Detection of high-affinity antibodies to dsDNA in the serum would suggest a diagnosis of SLE, which does occur predominantly in women of childbearing age and can cause neurological symptoms.

She is asymptomatic between episodes. Which of the following findings most closely correlates with this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient presents with vertigo and nausea, which are common symptoms of a vestibular disorder.","answers":[{"option":"Nystagmus","explanation":"\nVertigo and nausea are common symptoms of dysfunctions of the vestibular system, which often also present with pronounced nystagmus. This patient's episodic vertigo triggered by specific types of head movement suggests benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is confirmed by observing nystagmus during a provoked maneuver such as the Dix Hallpike test.\nPatients with a positive Dix Hallpike test for right-sided BPPV (with the head rotated to the right) will have rotational nystagmus with a counterclockwise rapid phase. Clockwise rapid phase nystagmus on rotation to the left is positive for left-sided BPPV.","bool":true},{"option":"Orthostatic hypotension","explanation":"\nOrthostatic hypotension is an episodic phenomenon that causes dizziness or faintness upon standing and may indicate cardiac or neurologic disease if it becomes recurrent. Although orthostatic hypotension is episodic, it does not present with vertigo and nausea as experienced by this patient. Furthermore, while orthostatic hypotension has positional triggers such as standing up, turning of the head does not trigger symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Intention tremor","explanation":"\nIntention tremor is a sign of cerebellar dysfunction that can result from a variety of neurological conditions. While some patients with intention tremor experience dizziness, this is due to disequilibrium secondary to cerebellar dysfunction rather than vestibular dysfunction. Dizziness due to a balance disorder is triggered by walking instead of head rotation, as seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Abnormal Rinne test","explanation":"An abnormal Rinne test is a sign of conductive hearing loss, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including cerumen impaction, otosclerosis, and otitis media. Although these conditions can cause dizziness, this patient's pattern of episodic vertigo triggered by specific types of head movement indicates a different cause for her symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Positive Romberg test","explanation":"A positive Romberg test is indicative of dysfunction of the dorsal columns, which can result from conditions such as longstanding uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or syphilis. Dorsal column dysfunction leads to sensory ataxia, which may manifest with vertigo. However, vertigo due to a sensory ataxia is triggered by movement of the extremities instead of head rotation as the symptoms in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Expressive aphasia","explanation":"\nExpressive aphasia, also known as Broca aphasia, is a sign of dysfunction of the frontal lobe at the inferior frontal gyrus. Brain lesions can cause central vertigo, but this is usually due to lesions of the brain stem or cerebellum, not the frontal lobe. This patient's vertigo is episodic rather than chronic, as would be expected in a patient with lesions of the CNS.","bool":false},{"option":"Binocular diplopia","explanation":"\nBinocular diplopia, commonly known as double vision, is a sign of dysfunction of the extraocular muscles. While visual impairment can induce vertigo, it is not triggered by head rotation as in this patient.","bool":false}]},{"id":65,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 5-year-old boy who recently emigrated from Nigeria is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of lower leg weakness, swallowing difficulty, and drooling of saliva.

In addition, preexposure prophylaxis is indicated for travelers to regions in which rabies is widespread, especially if postexposure prophylaxis may not be readily available (see “Overview of travel immunizations” table). Apart from bats, the most common animal reservoirs of rabies in the US are raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Encephalitic rabies usually leads to coma and death within days to weeks of the development of neurological symptoms. At the patient's stage of the disease, only palliative treatment is available.\nImmunoglobulin and vaccination administration are recommended as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for patients with rabies. The anti-rabies virus immunoglobulin provides immediate protection by binding to the rabies virus and thereby neutralizing it. However, protection is only temporary, since the antibodies degrade and the titers decrease over time. The simultaneous administration of the rabies vaccine stimulates the body's immune system, which reacts by producing antibodies. Treatment with PEP in suspected cases of a rabid animal bite should take place immediately, as the disease is fatal once it is symptomatic.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Antibiotic therapy","explanation":"\nAntibiotic therapy would be administered if the patient's clinical presentation were due to an infectious cause treatable with antibiotics (e.g., bacterial, protozoal).

The short-term memory loss indicates selective neuronal necrosis of a structure within the limbic system.","answers":[{"option":"Pyramidal cells of the hippocampus","explanation":"Damage to the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus typically leads to anterograde amnesia, as seen in this patient. The hippocampus is the brain region most vulnerable to ischemic hypoxia, and only a few minutes of ischemia can lead to irreversible damage mediated by cytotoxic glutamatergic release and uptake. Other brain regions that are particularly susceptible to ischemic insults are neocortical pyramidal cells, striatal neurons, and Purkinje cells.","bool":true},{"option":"External pyramidal layer of the parietal cortex","explanation":"The external pyramidal layer of the parietal cortex is very vulnerable to ischemic injury.

However, patients with ischemic damage to this group of cells would present with intention tremor, nystagmus, and ataxia.","bool":false},{"option":"Astroglial cells of the putamen","explanation":"\nAstroglial cells (also known as astrocytes) of the putamen are relatively resistant to ischemic injury mainly because they can use glycogen stores for anaerobic metabolism. Moreover, injury to the cells of the putamen results in impaired voluntary muscle control rather than memory loss. Following an ischemic event, astrocytes become reactive and form a glial scar (reactive gliosis).","bool":false},{"option":"Microglial cells of dorsal midbrain","explanation":"\nMicroglial cells are relatively resistant to ischemic insults because they are not as metabolically active as neurons.

Further manifestations of early neuroborreliosis include meningitis and asymmetrical polyneuropathy. Stage II Lyme disease can also manifest with Lyme carditis (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias such as AV block), borrelial lymphocytoma, and ocular manifestations (e.g., retinal vasculitis, keratitis). Diagnosis is mainly clinical but can be supported by two-step serologic testing (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay followed by Western blot). Because this patient has bradycardia, an urgent electrocardiogram should also be performed to evaluate for AV block. Doxycycline is the drug of choice for mild early disseminated Lyme disease, while ceftriaxone is indicated for severe illness.\nEarly localized (stage I) Lyme disease commonly manifests with a singular erythema migrans (EM) lesion and flulike symptoms (e.g., myalgias, arthralgias). Late (stage III) Lyme disease is characterized by Lyme arthritis, late neuroborreliosis, and, rarely, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.","bool":true},{"option":"Liver capsule inflammation","explanation":"\nLiver capsule inflammation can be a finding of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease secondary to gonorrhea.

This patient has neither a history of Streptococcus pyogenes infection (e.g., strep throat) nor further expected symptoms of rheumatic fever such as constitutional symptoms, Sydenham chorea, or subcutaneous nodules. Additionally, rheumatic fever is increasingly uncommon in high-income countries because of improved hygiene standards, a decline in infections with rheumatogenic strains of streptococci, and the routine use of antibiotics for streptococcal pharyngitis. This patient's history of camping in a region endemic for Lyme disease makes a different complication more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Bone marrow failure","explanation":"\nBone marrow failure can be indicative of an aplastic crisis, which is a complication of a parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 can manifest with both arthritis and dermatitis; however, children are more likely to develop the “slapped-cheek rash” without joint involvement, while adults often develop symmetrical polyarthritis (fingers, hands, knees, and ankles) without dermatologic manifestations.

His symptoms have worsened over the past month.","answers":[{"option":"Medication-induced tremor","explanation":"This patient has an enhanced physiologic tremor, most likely caused by the recent SSRI (i.e., paroxetine) uptitration. While physiologic tremor is a normal finding in all individuals, worsening physiologic tremor should be investigated; enhanced sympathetic stimulation due to, e.g., anxiety, stress, or certain medications (e.g., SSRIs, beta-2 agonists, valproate) or medical conditions (e.g., pheochromocytoma) can increase tremor severity and may affect individuals' quality of life. SSRIs are also known to worsen preexisting essential tremors. Investigations to determine the underlying cause include thyroid function tests, liver function tests, blood glucose levels, and a medication review. If a medication is the suspected cause, down-titration should be attempted while monitoring the effect on tremor severity. Propranolol may be prescribed if the tremor affects the individual's work (e.g., for violinists).","bool":true},{"option":"Drug-induced hypoglycemia","explanation":"Drug-induced hypoglycemia most often occurs as a result of improper use of certain antidiabetic medications, such as insulin, and may manifest with tremors. However, hypoglycemia also typically manifests with pallor, sweating, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting.","bool":false},{"option":"Functional tremor","explanation":"\nFunctional tremor (FT) is a type of postural tremor that can occur in patients with psychiatric conditions (e.g., major depressive disorder). However, in addition to postural tremor, FT also manifests with resting and/or action tremor, all of which can occur simultaneously. Furthermore, FT is characterized by changes in the frequency, amplitude, and/or distribution of movement over time with rapid progression to severe symptoms, as opposed to gradual worsening over the course of a month. Finally, FT amplitude usually attenuates if the patient's attention is directed away from the affected body part.","bool":false},{"option":"Factitious hyperthyroidism","explanation":"\nFactitious hyperthyroidism may be suspected in patients taking levothyroxine who present with an enhanced physiologic tremor. The initial workup to determine the cause of enhanced tremor should include serum thyroid hormone measurements. However, heat intolerance, palpitations, tachycardia, and shortness of breath would also be expected in a patient with hyperthyroidism.","bool":false},{"option":"Parkinson disease","explanation":"\nParkinson disease (PD) manifests with tremors and risk factors include a family history of PD. However, the tremor seen in PD is typically unilateral at onset and usually occurs when the affected body part is fully relaxed and supported against gravity (i.e., resting tremor). Furthermore, PD is often associated with rigidity on passive flexion.","bool":false}]},{"id":89,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 20-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother because of fever and pain in the right ear for the past 2 days.

The patient attends daycare 5 days per week and participates in parent-child swimming classes. She has no known medication allergies. Her vaccinations are up-to-date. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 23/min, and blood pressure is 105/60 mm Hg. On examination, she cries and tugs on her right ear. Otoscopy of the right ear shows an erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane with an air-fluid level in the anterosuperior quadrant. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best approach to prevent the recurrence of these symptoms in this patient?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The combination of fever, otalgia, and fluid accumulation behind an erythematous and bulging tympanic membrane (TM) on otoscopy indicates acute otitis media (AOM).","answers":[{"option":"Myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion","explanation":"\nMyringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion should be considered in children with recurrent AOM (i.e., ≥ 4 episodes in 12 months or ≥ 3 episodes in 6 months). The placement of small tubes in the tympanic membrane enables the drainage of fluid and helps to maintain an air-filled space in the middle ear, which can decrease the frequency of AOM episodes. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in recurrent AOM is not recommended.\nAcute management of AOM, on the other hand, consists of analgesia (acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen). Antibiotic treatment (e.g., oral amoxicillin) is indicated in patients ≤ 6 months of age, in those &lt; 2 years of age with bilateral AOM, and in all patients with severe infections (moderate to severe otalgia, otalgia lasting &gt; 48 hours, and/or fever ≥ 39°C). Daycare attendance is a risk factor for AOM because of increased exposure to respiratory pathogens.","bool":true},{"option":"Application of acetic acid ear drops after swimming","explanation":"The application of acetic acid ear drops after swimming helps to dry and reacidify the ear canal and prevent skin maceration. This intervention is used to stop the recurrence of otitis externa, for which swimming is a risk factor.

Triptans induce cerebral vasoconstriction by inhibiting the release of vasoactive peptide and reduce neurogenic inflammation associated with migraine. They are especially effective if taken early at the onset of an attack. Adverse effects of triptans include coronary vasospasm, serotonin syndrome, and paresthesias.","bool":true},{"option":"Inactivation of GABA degradation","explanation":"\nValproate is an antiepileptic drug that increases the levels of the neurotransmitter GABA by inhibiting GABA transaminase. It is used for prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches but would not be used in the abortive treatment of migraine headache.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors","explanation":"Inhibition of β1 receptors and β2 receptors is the mechanism of action of non-selective β-blockers (e.g., propranolol), which can be used for the long-term prophylaxis of migraine headaches. β-blockers inhibit norepinephrine release, which stabilizes neuronal membranes, reducing their activity and excitability. However, vasoconstriction of intracranial vessels has not been described among their effects in the treatment of migraine.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of 5-HT and NE reuptake","explanation":"Inhibition of 5-HT and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake is the mechanism of action of amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant used for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches.

Early features include neck pain, which is typically worse with neck flexion and maneuvers that increase ICP (e.g., sneezing). Later, patients present with long tract signs (e.g., sensory and motor deficits that progress from one extremity to the others). Other late findings include spasticity (hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign), gait disturbances, and lower cranial nerve palsies (CN IX–XII), which most likely accounts for this patient's dysarthria and atrophy of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles.

The sensory symptoms in syringomyelia are often exacerbated by maneuvers that increase the intramedullary pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing), as in this patient. Muscle atrophy is another common feature of syringomyelia and most commonly affects the small muscles of the hand. Other LMN signs, such as fasciculations and areflexia (rather than this patient's hyperreflexia), may also be present. While spastic paraparesis of the limbs is a possible feature of syringomyelia (involvement of the pyramidal tract and first motor neuron), quadriparesis would be uncommon.","bool":false},{"option":"Amytrophic lateral sclerosis","explanation":"\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis manifests with signs of UMN (e.g., hyperreflexia, spastic paresis) as well as LMN involvement (e.g., atrophy, fasciculations, and flaccid paresis), both of which are present in this patient. ALS may initially present with bulbar symptoms (e.g., dysarthria, dysphagia) and/or asymmetric limb weakness, which often begins unilaterally in an upper extremity and progresses during the course of disease. However, her only LMN deficit is the result of a lower cranial nerve lesion (sternocleidomastoid muscle atrophy due to CN XI involvement), whereas other typical LMN lesions are missing (muscle atrophy of the extremities and fasciculations).

Superior sulcus tumors can infiltrate neighboring structures and cause additional symptoms, which is known as Pancoast syndrome. This patient's shoulder and arm pain are likely symptoms of Pancoast syndrome, which also includes atrophy of the arm and hand muscles, and possibly superior vena cava syndrome and hoarseness due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The most common cause of Pancoast syndrome is NSCLC, for which this patient is at risk because of his history of smoking.","bool":true},{"option":"Dissection of the carotid artery","explanation":"\nCarotid artery dissection can cause Horner syndrome by compressing the postganglionic sympathetic fibers near the internal carotid artery and damaging them directly or decreasing blood flow to their vasa nervorum. This patient's smoking history is a risk factor for carotid artery dissection. However, carotid artery dissection most often has an acute onset of symptoms following some types of trauma (e.g., blunt trauma), which is not the case here.

Symptoms of PCS are highly variable and may include cognitive (e.g., difficulty concentrating, poor memory), psychiatric (e.g., irritability, affective disturbance, personality changes, apathy), and somatic changes (e.g., headaches, fatigue, sleep disturbances, dizziness). The diagnosis is clinical and is usually established based on the presence of at least three of the aforementioned symptoms after a documented TBI. Neuroimaging can be considered in patients with disabling or intractable symptoms to exclude organic causes. PCS typically resolves within 3–6 months. In patients with persistent symptoms, conservative measures such as rest and avoidance of stress, symptomatic pharmacotherapy (e.g., analgesics, antiemetics, sleeping aid), and psychotherapy can be considered.

Initially, uncal herniation manifests with ipsilateral compression of CN III and the corticospinal tract (resulting in contralateral hemiparesis). As herniation of the ipsilateral (right) uncus progresses, displacing the midbrain and compressing the contralateral (left) cerebral peduncle (which contains the left corticospinal tract) across the tentorium, it causes ipsilateral (right-sided) hemiparesis and upper motor neuron (UMN) signs (e.g., Babinski sign) as most corticospinal fibers cross over, a process called Kernohan phenomenon. This can be confusing in a clinical setting because the patient's lesion is on the right side, but right-sided hemiplegia typically localizes a left-sided lesion (this is why Kernohan syndrome is also called false localizing syndrome). This patient's extensor posturing is a sign that midbrain compression has already begun.\nAfter emergency resuscitative measures (e.g., intubation, mannitol, oxygen supplementation, and head of bed elevation), emergency surgical decompression is required. As the herniation progresses, the brainstem can become compressed and displaced caudally, shearing the vessels, leading to midbrain and pontine hemorrhages, and subsequently resulting in coma, apnea, impaired circulation, and death.","bool":true},{"option":"Left-sided facial nerve palsy","explanation":"Acute left-sided facial nerve palsy is commonly caused by stroke affecting the facial nerve nucleus or its tract in the pons, or inflammation of the nerve peripherally (e.g., Bell palsy).

When CN III is unopposed, the associated extraocular muscles (medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles) together produce adduction and elevation or depression of the eye. Instead, uncal herniation causes CN III palsy, resulting in pupillary dilation and absent light reflex (as seen in this patient), abduction, and slight depression of the eye (“down and out” gaze). Although severe advanced uncal herniation can eventually cause CN IV and VI palsies due to brainstem displacement and secondary hemorrhagic brainstem infarctions, CN III would also likely be impaired. In concomitant CN III, CN IV, and CN VI palsies, the eye position would be closer to a neutral gaze.","bool":false},{"option":"Bilateral spasticity","explanation":"\nSpasticity indicates upper motor neuron (UMN) damage.

During tonic-clonic seizures, excess muscle exertion results in inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissue, followed by anaerobic respiration and an increase in serum lactate. Postictal acidosis is transient and typically resolves within two hours. Therapy with IV bicarbonate is not needed; rather, electrolytes and arterial blood gases should be monitored until they normalize. An EEG can help guide decisions on the need for long-term anticonvulsant therapy.\nFurther laboratory abnormalities in patients who have experienced tonic-clonic seizures include hyperprolactinemia, increased creatinine kinase, elevated cortisol, elevated white blood cell count, neuron-specific enolase, and lactate dehydrogenase.

Although severe hypocalcemia can cause seizures, hypercalcemia generally does not, making it an unlikely cause of this patient's symptoms. During high-exertion activities (e.g., generalized muscle contractions) in which oxygen delivery to the tissue is inadequate, muscles use anaerobic respiration, which can cause lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis increases the serum concentrations of ionized calcium due to the competition of hydrogen ions with calcium for the same binding site on albumin.

She occasionally has tantrums and there are times when she does not recognize him. She sleeps 6–8 hours throughout the day and is increasingly agitated and confused at night. When the phone, television, or oven beeps she thinks she is at the dentist's office and becomes very anxious. She eats 2–3 meals a day and has a good appetite. She has not fallen. She has not left the home in weeks except for short walks. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She takes levothyroxine, aspirin, warfarin, donepezil, verapamil, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin daily.  Vital signs are within normal limits.

The nerve that innervates these muscles originates from spinal roots L2–L4 and lies below the inguinal ligament.","answers":[{"option":"Femoral nerve","explanation":"Motor fibers of the femoral nerve (L2–L4 nerve roots) innervate the hip flexors. Selectively blocking the femoral nerve would improve hip flexor spasticity. One adverse effect, though, would be a loss of knee extension because the nerve also innervates the quadriceps femoris muscles.

Although this patient does not have the classic triad of symptoms, gait apraxia is the most relevant finding of NPH and should, therefore, raise clinical suspicion for this condition and warrant further evaluation. NPH is diagnosed based on typical clinical features, supportive findings on imaging (i.e., ventriculomegaly without or out of proportion to sulcal enlargement), and normal or only mildly elevated opening pressure. To evaluate opening pressure, a lumbar tap test should be performed in patients with suspected NPH.

This patient likely has chronic hyponatremia due to his excess drinking (referred to as beer potomania), which causes chronic brain swelling. When sodium levels are increased too quickly, especially in patients with sodium levels &lt; 120 meq/L, the fluid shifts causes the brain to shrink and demyelinate.

However, lower motor neuron signs would only be expected at the level of the lesion with upper motor neuron signs (e.g., spastic paralysis, hyperreflexia) below the level of cord compression. Moreover, compressive myelopathy typically causes unilateral symptoms and it is often associated with other features such as back pain, which is not seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","explanation":"Muscle weakness and lower motor neuron signs raise suspicion for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, ALS characteristically manifests with both lower and upper motor neuron signs (e.g., spastic paralysis, hyperreflexia). Moreover, ALS only affects the motor neurons; thus, sensory loss and ataxia would not be expected because sensory neurons are typically spared.","bool":false},{"option":"Cauda equina syndrome","explanation":"Sensory loss, muscle weakness, and lower motor neuron signs may be seen in cauda equina syndrome.

Musculocutaneous nerve injury can result from lifting heavy weights as seen in this case. This injury also impairs forearm supination and the biceps tendon reflex. The normal range of motion in the neck and negative Spurling sign indicate that this patient has a peripheral nerve lesion.\nSome symptoms of musculocutaneous nerve injury may be masked by the fact that the supinator muscle (innervated by the radial nerve) can at least partially compensate for the supination deficit; in addition, the brachioradialis muscle (also innervated by the radial nerve) is an elbow flexor.","bool":true},{"option":"Forearm pronation","explanation":"Forearm pronation is controlled by the pronator teres and pronator quadratus muscles, which are innervated by the median nerve.

A palpable, well-circumscribed mass within the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) due to fibrosis is also common. Ultrasound of the SCM can confirm the muscular origin of the mass. First-line treatment of congenital torticollis involves early initiation of physiotherapy with positioning exercises and passive stretching therapy to strengthen neck muscles, lengthen the SCM, and improve the cervical range of motion. The majority of cases of congenital torticollis resolve after 2–6 months of conservative management.

Symptoms depend on the location of the meningioma, and patients are often asymptomatic if the tumor is small. On MRI, meningiomas appear as round, sharply demarcated, space-occupying lesions, which is similar to this patient's tumor. In rare cases, meningiomas arise at the cerebellopontine angle. This can manifest with hearing loss and ataxia, but usually does not cause tinnitus. Furthermore, because vestibular schwannomas account for &gt; 80% of tumors of the cerebellopontine angle, this diagnosis is much more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Pleomorphic cells clustered around necrotic areas forming pseudopalisades","explanation":"\nPleomorphic cells clustered around necrotic areas to form pseudopalisades suggest glioblastoma multiforme (GM), a malignant tumor of astrocytes. Depending on the location, GM can manifest with focal neurologic deficits and seizures. Tinnitus and hearing loss would be uncommon.

The absence of lateralization on Weber tests suggests that both ears are equally affected, while the normal Rinne test suggests that the hearing loss is sensorineural in origin.","answers":[{"option":"Destruction of the organ of Corti","explanation":"\nNoise-induced hearing loss is caused by the destruction of cochlear hair cells, also known as the organ of Corti. In a normally functioning ear, sound waves are transmitted mechanically through the tympanic membrane, via the ossicles, and through the oval window to the perilymph-filled inner ear. The resulting vibrations are transmitted to the cochlear hair cells, from where neurologic impulses are transmitted via the vestibulocochlear nerve. Repeated exposure to sounds louder than 85 dB, like those this man experiences at work, or even an isolated exposure to extremely loud sounds greater than 140 dB, can damage the organ of Corti and result in subsequent sensorineural hearing loss that typically affects high-frequency hearing first.","bool":true},{"option":"Excess endolymphatic fluid pressure","explanation":"Excess endolymphatic fluid pressure resulting in sensorineural hearing loss is seen in Meniere disease. Symptoms are usually unilateral and typically include hearing loss, aural fullness, episodic vertigo, and tinnitus, none of which are present in this patient.

The patient described in this case has high-frequency hearing loss that is bilateral, as suggested by the absence of lateralization on the Weber test.","bool":false},{"option":"Compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve","explanation":"External compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve can be caused by tumors such as acoustic neuromas, which are usually unilateral, although they may be bilateral in neurofibromatosis type 2. Compression of this nerve would also result in sensorineural hearing loss. However, acoustic neuromas are usually accompanied by dizziness and ataxia, and they are unlikely to cause isolated symmetrical high-frequency hearing loss. Given this patient's history of chronic exposure to loud noises, a different etiology of his hearing loss is much more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Perforation of the tympanic membrane","explanation":"\nPerforation of the tympanic membrane causes conductive hearing loss and thus results in an abnormal Rinne test. Tympanic membrane perforation can be caused by foreign body trauma, temporal bone fractures, otitis media, barotrauma, or blast injury. While this patient's occupation puts him at increased risk of damage to the ear, there is nothing in this patient's history to suggest tympanic membrane perforation and the Rinne test was normal, indicating that he does not have conductive hearing loss.","bool":false},{"option":"Rupture of the oval window","explanation":"Rupture of the oval window is a cause of hearing loss associated with barotrauma. Sudden decreases in pressure between the inner and outer ear cause dissolved gasses to be released from the perilymphatic fluid in the inner ear and results in rupture of the oval window. Patients with barotrauma will have a recent history of diving or flying, which this patient does not. In addition, the sensorineural hearing loss resulting from rupture of the oval window is not limited to high-frequency sounds.","bool":false},{"option":"Immobility of the stapes","explanation":"Immobility of the stapes is the cause of otosclerosis, which can result in conductive hearing loss. The stapes lies against the oval window and transmits sounds from the tympanic membrane. In otosclerosis, the ossicles are rendered immobile by extensive bony remodeling.

There would also be a clear sensory level that is concordant with the motor deficits in a patient with TM, whereas this patient has no clearly discernable sensory level. In addition, CSF pleocytosis is a characteristic feature of TM, which is not seen here, and TM usually manifests in the 2nd and 4th decades of life, not the 1st decade.\nBecause of the immune-mediated origin of GBS, corticosteroids were formerly believed to be an effective treatment. However, recent studies have shown that treatment with corticosteroids is not beneficial in GBS and may even be associated with worse outcomes. The only exception is in the chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) variant of GBS, as corticosteroids are an effective treatment in this disorder; however, CIDP progresses slowly (typically over &gt; 2 months) and therefore is unlikely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous vancomycin and cefotaxime","explanation":"Intravenous vancomycin and cefotaxime (or another third-generation cephalosporin) can be used in combination as the empiric treatment for bacterial meningitis in children &gt; 1 month old and adults &lt; 50 years old.

Occlusion of the paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery and/or vertebral artery can lead to medial medullary syndrome, which is caused by infarction of the corticospinal tract, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nucleus, as seen here. This patient's history of coronary heart disease, hypertension, and smoking history suggests a thrombotic stroke, which is caused by plaque rupture in arteriosclerotic arteries. After the exclusion of bleeding as a cause, treatment will most likely consist of reperfusion therapy, supportive care, and prevention of post-stroke complications.\nOcclusion of the anterior spinal artery below the level of the medulla causes anterior spinal cord syndrome, which manifests with quadriplegia or paraplegia and bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensations in the trunk and extremities.","bool":true},{"option":"D","explanation":"This is the left superior cerebellar artery, which supplies the superior cerebellar peduncle, anterior cerebellar lobe, and part of the lateral tegmentum ipsilaterally.

Transmission occurs when contaminated water enters the nasal cavity (e.g., during swimming or diving). N. fowleri trophozoites penetrate the olfactory mucosa and the cribriform plate to reach the olfactory bulb and subsequently spread to the brain. N. fowleri consumes glial cells and causes rapidly progressing, fulminant, necrotizing meningoencephalitis. CSF analysis would show features similar to those of bacterial meningitis (e.g., neutrophilic pleocytosis, hypoglycorrhachia, increased CSF protein), trophozoites, and possibly CSF erythrocytosis (due to hemorrhagic necrosis).

Examples of such pathogens include certain bacteria (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, Enterobacter spp.), fungi (e.g., Candida), and viruses (e.g., hepatitis C virus). This patient with trophozoites in CSF has a protozoal meningoencephalitis, which is not caused by dissemination in the bloodstream.","bool":false},{"option":"Contiguous spread to the meninges","explanation":"Contiguous spread refers to the dissemination of pathogens through adjacent structures. The meninges are protected from the external environment by cranial bones. A contiguous route of infection to the meninges is only possible if the meninges are exposed to the external environment by an opening in the cranial vault or fossa as a result of surgery (e.g., craniotomy), trauma, or infection (e.g., bacterial or fungal sinusitis), or if the middle ear is infected (allows contiguous spread to the meninges via the cochlear aqueduct). There is no history of recent paranasal or otologic infection, surgery, or trauma in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Invasion of the oral mucosa","explanation":"Invasion of the oral mucosa is the route of infection of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). HSV encephalitis manifests with most of this patient's CSF findings (pleocytosis, high opening pressure, increased protein, CSF erythrocytosis) and similar clinical features. However, HSV encephalitis typically affects the frontal and temporal lobe, and patients with this condition usually have enhancement of these brain regions on contrast imaging, as well as behavioral changes and dysphasia, none of which are seen here. Moreover, viral encephalitis typically does not cause hypoglycorrhachia, and the presence of trophozoites in CSF indicates a protozoal rather than viral infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Inoculation by an arthropod vector","explanation":"\nInoculation by an arthropod vector is the route of infection for arboviral meningoencephalitis (e.g., St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile meningoencephalitis). Outdoor activities (e.g., hiking) increase risk for arboviral infections, and arboviral meningoencephalitis causes some of this patient's CSF findings (e.g., pleocytosis, high opening pressure, increased protein) and similar clinical features. However, arboviral meningoencephalitis usually has a biphasic course; features of meningoencephalitis (e.g., confusion, vomiting, Brudzinki sign) would have been preceded by several days of flu-like symptoms, which were not present in this patient.

A sudden rise in blood osmolarity results in increased movement of fluid from the interstitial cerebral space to the intravascular compartment (to maintain an osmotic balance), which then causes myelin sheath edema and damage. Symptoms of ODS appear 2–6 days after correction of hyponatremia and include an altered level of consciousness (e.g., coma), locked-in syndrome, signs of cranial nerve dysfunction (e.g., dysarthria, dysphagia, diplopia), and/or worsening quadriparesis.\nThis patient likely has chronic hyponatremia due to chronic heavy drinking (i.e., beer potomania), which causes chronic cerebral edema and therefore increases the risk of developing ODS. It is recommended that serum sodium levels in affected individuals be raised at a rate of 0.5–1 mEq/L per hour until a total sodium correction of 4 to 6 mEq/L has been achieved in 24 hours. Given this patient's severe symptoms, the increase should be achieved within 6 hours.","bool":true},{"option":"Cerebral edema","explanation":"\nCerebral edema can develop as a complication of overly rapid correction of hypernatremia, not hyponatremia, as seen in this patient. Chronic hypernatremia causes an expansion of the intravascular volume; when sodium levels are acutely decreased, fluid shifts to the extravascular space causing brain swelling and edema, which can result in seizures, and at times, permanent neurologic deficits and death. As such, it is recommended that sodium levels be decreased by no more than 12 mEq/L per day.","bool":false},{"option":"Wernicke encephalopathy","explanation":"\nWernicke encephalopathy is an acute and reversible emergency caused by severe thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. It is mainly seen in the context of alcohol abuse. While this patient has a history of chronic alcohol intake and is currently confused, he lacks other classic features of Wernicke encephalopathy such as ataxia and ophthalmoplegia, making this diagnosis unlikely. In patients with suspected Wernicke encephalopathy, thiamine should always be administered before glucose, as glucose increases thiamine demand and can worsen encephalopathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Respiratory depression","explanation":"Respiratory depression in the setting of alcohol abuse would be seen in patients in which benzodiazepines are given to prevent alcohol withdrawal syndrome. While this patient presented after a seizure (vigorously shaking for about 1 minute, urinated on himself), which can be seen in alcohol withdrawal syndrome, he has no features of ongoing withdrawal such as anxiety, palpitations, sweating, and autonomic hyperactivity. Additionally, withdrawal manifestations typically develop after six hours from the last alcoholic beverage, this patient's last drink was two hours ago, making this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Cardiac arrhythmia","explanation":"\nCardiac arrhythmias are unlikely to develop from excess sodium correction. Arrhythmias can happen in extreme cases of hypernatremia (Na+ &gt; 190 mmol/L), but it is a rare complication of rapid correction of hyponatremia. Potassium fluctuations, on the other hand, are associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias. This patient's vital signs and potassium are within normal limits, making a cardiac condition unlikely to be the cause of his presentation.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperglycemia","explanation":"\nHyperglycemia can be seen in patients given dextrose-containing intravenous fluids at a rapid rate for correction of hypernatremia.

Risk factors for this condition include older age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glaucoma.","answers":[{"option":"Fluorescein angiography","explanation":"\nFluorescein angiography (FA) is indicated as a next step to confirm the diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), evaluate the severity of CRVO, and decide whether laser photocoagulation should be performed. While nonischemic CRVO is characterized by a markedly prolonged arteriovenous transit time on FA, FA in ischemic CRVO typically shows ≥ 10 disc areas of retinal nonperfusion, which predisposes to complications of neovascularization (i.e., rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment). To prevent neovascularization, ischemic CRVO must be treated with panretinal photocoagulation and intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and/or steroids. Further work-up includes optical coherence tomography (OCT), which helps to determine the extent of macular edema and monitor the response to treatment. CRVO has a poor prognosis: visual acuity only improves in a third of patients. Nonischemic CRVO usually does not require treatment.","bool":true},{"option":"Emergency retinal tamponade","explanation":"Emergency retinal tamponade is the treatment of choice for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. This type of retinal detachment can manifest with sudden, painless loss of vision and an afferent pupillary defect in one eye. However, this condition is often preceded by prodromal symptoms that result from posterior vitreous detachment, including floaters, photopsia, and scotomas.

Most affected individuals have multiple sclerosis; other common etiologies include infections (e.g., tuberculosis, Lyme disease) and use of toxic substances (e.g., ethambutol, methanol). Moreover, loss of color vision and visual field defects (e.g., central scotoma) are common features, and ophthalmoscopy findings may be normal (in retrobulbar neuritis) or show signs of papillitis.

Epidural hemorrhage should be suspected in any patient with head trauma that causes loss of consciousness, followed by a lucid interval, and subsequent worsening with signs of increased ICP. CT scan of the head would show a characteristic lentiform (lens-shaped) hemorrhagic collection that does not cross suture lines. While this patient does have signs of increased ICP following a trauma, his CT findings suggest a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Into the cerebral parenchyma","explanation":"Bleeding directly into the cerebral parenchyma, known as intracerebral hemorrhage, is typically caused by a spontaneous rupture of vessels secondary to structural changes of the vessel walls (e.g., chronic hypertension, cerebral amyloid angiopathy).

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's hoarseness?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient's fatigue, exertional dyspnea, irregular heart rhythm, and hepatomegaly suggest atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure (CHF). In this setting, the diastolic murmur at the apex is concerning for mitral stenosis, which commonly leads to left atrial dilation.","answers":[{"option":"Extrinsic impingement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve","explanation":"The left recurrent laryngeal nerve winds around the arch of the aorta. Massive enlargement of the left atrium (and potentially also the pulmonary artery) in patients with mitral stenosis can compress this nerve resulting in hoarseness (Ortner syndrome). Other rare complications associated with massive left atrial enlargement are massive hemoptysis due to erosion of the bronchial arteries and esophageal compression (dysphagia megalatriensis).","bool":true},{"option":"Bacterial infection of the vocal folds","explanation":"Infection of the vocal folds (laryngitis) with bacteria such as Moraxella catarrhalis, Hemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause hoarseness and fatigue, but the onset of symptoms would be acute, unlike in this patient, who has had symptoms for the past 5 months, and would likely include sore throat or a dry cough. Moreover, laryngitis would not cause exertional dyspnea, fatigue, hepatomegaly, or a diastolic murmur.","bool":false},{"option":"Laryngeal inflammation due to chemical irritant","explanation":"Laryngeal inflammation from acidic gastric contents, which occurs in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause persistent hoarseness, but it would not cause exertional dyspnea, fatigue, hepatomegaly, or a diastolic murmur. Furthermore, this patient does not have other common features of GERD such as postprandial chest pain, belching, or dry cough.","bool":false},{"option":"Carcinoma arising from the mucosa of the larynx","explanation":"A squamous cell carcinoma arising from laryngeal mucosa can cause hoarseness, fatigue, dyspnea due to lung metastases and, rarely, hepatomegaly due to liver metastases.

The key clinical finding is symmetric proximal muscle weakness, which can manifest as pain while walking, but other findings such as difficulty combing hair, standing up, and climbing stairs would be present as well. Furthermore, patients with myositis commonly have muscle tenderness and cutaneous manifestations (such as Gottron papules), which this patient lacks.","bool":false},{"option":"Measurement of HLA-B27 antigen","explanation":"Measurement of HLA-B27 antigen is performed in patients with suspected ankylosing spondylitis. The most characteristic findings include dull pain in the neck and lower back independent of positioning, limited mobility of the spine, and morning stiffness that improves with activity. In addition, onset is usually prior to age 40 and the disease follows a gradual, progressive course.

When otoliths become displaced into one of the semicircular ducts, they can disrupt the endolymph and thus lead to stimulation of the hair cells on the cupula. This stimulation sends signals to the brain that suggest motion even if the patient is not moving, thus triggering the sensation of vertigo. Although this patient has vertigo, he also has cochlear symptoms (tinnitus and hearing loss), which are typically absent in patients with BPPV. In addition, contrary to this patient's presentation, vertigo in BPPV lasts only for a few seconds and is triggered by movement.","bool":false},{"option":"Demyelinating plaques","explanation":"\nPlaques of demyelination are a typical MRI finding in patients with multiple sclerosis. Some patients can develop vertigo (in the case of cerebellar or brainstem involvement), but hearing loss and tinnitus are very rare symptoms. A common first manifestation of multiple sclerosis is impaired vision (due to retrobulbar neuritis), and as the disease progresses, other sensory and/or motor neurological deficits appear.","bool":false},{"option":"Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction","explanation":"\nInfarction of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery causes lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome.

These symptoms are highly suggestive of rabies infection due to a bite by a raccoon, which are a major animal reservoir of rabies.","answers":[{"option":"Chemically-inactivated virus","explanation":"Administration of a chemically-inactivated virus (i.e., killed vaccine) along with rabies immunoglobulin is recommended as postexposure prophylaxis for patients with suspected rabies. The immunoglobulin provides immediate protection by binding to the rabies virus and neutralizing it (i.e., passive immunity). However, protection is only temporary, since antibodies degrade over time. Simultaneous administration of the rabies vaccine stimulates the body's immune system, which reacts by producing antibodies (i.e., active immunity). Preventive active immunization with rabies vaccine is indicated for people with frequent occupational contact with potentially rabid animals and travelers to regions in which rabies is widespread.\nTreatment with postexposure prophylaxis in suspected cases of a rabid animal bite should take place immediately, as the disease is fatal once it has become symptomatic. At this patient's stage of the disease, only palliative treatment is available.","bool":true},{"option":"RNA-dependent DNA polymerase inhibitor","explanation":"\nNRTIs and NNRTIs are RNA-dependent DNA polymerase inhibitors and are used in antiretroviral HIV therapy.

Cerebral autoregulation is controlled by the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2).\n\n","answers":[{"option":"Hyperventilation","explanation":"\nHyperventilation blows off CO2, which lowers PaCO2 levels and results in arterial smooth muscle constriction. Based on Poiseuille's law, small decreases in the arterial radius from vasoconstriction can profoundly decrease cerebral blood flow. Since the cranial vault has a finite amount of space, decreasing cerebral blood flow allows more room for brain tissue and reductions in ICP.\nAlthough hyperventilation was commonly used to reduce ICP, studies have failed to show long-term outcome advantages. Prophylactic hyperventilation is no longer recommended and should only be used as a temporary measure for elevated ICP refractory to medical therapy.\n\n\n","bool":true},{"option":"Decompressive craniectomy","explanation":"\nDecompressive craniectomy can increase blood flow by creating more space for brain swelling and thus reducing intracranial pressure. This reduction in intracranial pressure can improve cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow. However, this technique is controversial, as the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy in traumatic brain injury is unclear and would not be the most appropriate first step in management for this patient.\n\n\n\n","bool":false},{"option":"Lumbar puncture","explanation":"\nLumbar puncture can increase cerebral blood flow by removing CSF, thus creating more space for brain tissue and vessels. This technique is most commonly used to lower ICP in patients with hydrocephalus (e.g., normal pressure hydrocephalus). However, lumbar puncture is contraindicated in any patient with increased intracranial pressure due to brain swelling, as CSF removal can release pressure in the lower spinal cord causing downward brain herniation and death.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous mannitol","explanation":"\nMannitol acts by rapidly expanding circulating blood volume and decreasing blood viscosity. This causes an increase in cerebral blood flow and the subsequent compensatory cerebral vasoconstriction results in an initial fall in ICP. After about 15–30 minutes, it further increases cerebral blood flow by increasing cerebral perfusion pressure. Because prolonged mannitol therapy can increase ICP, it should only be used in the acute phase in patients with signs of significant increases in ICP (e.g., mass effect, impending brain herniation).\n\n","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous hypertonic saline","explanation":"\nHypertonic saline increases blood osmolality, which draws water from brain tissue into the intravascular space and thereby reduces ICP.

Anosmia is typically associated with meningiomas arising from the olfactory groove (i.e., from the cribriform plate and frontosphenoidal suture), which account for 22% of all skull base meningiomas. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is a brain MRI, which is likely to show a round, sharply demarcated space-occupying lesion (resembling a snowball) with significant contrast enhancement. Management is based on the location and grade of the tumor, as well as patient-specific factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, accompanying symptoms). Treatment that reduces elevated intracranial pressure may improve visual function.","bool":true},{"option":"Multiple sclerosis","explanation":"\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a common cause of optic neuritis, especially in women of childbearing age. Optic neuritis can manifest with acute vision change and a relative afferent pupillary defect. While optic neuritis may cause papillitis, which occasionally manifests with papilledema, it does not result in optic atrophy. Also, MS typically manifests with relapsing, remitting neurologic symptoms in anatomically unrelated locations (i.e., symptoms disseminated in time and space), whereas this patient's symptoms are chronic and progressive. Less commonly, MS can cause chronic, progressive symptoms, but it does not cause elevated intracranial pressure, thus it would not explain this patient's headaches.","bool":false},{"option":"Hereditary optic neuropathy","explanation":"\nLeber hereditary optic neuropathy is the most common inherited optic neuropathy in young adults.

Corneal abrasions are defects in the corneal epithelium that often occur secondary to corneal trauma. Removal of contact lenses after wearing them overnight is likely to have caused a corneal abrasion in this patient. Fluorescein dye specifically stains the epithelial defects, making them easily identifiable on slit lamp, ophthalmoscopic, or Wood lamp examination. In addition, the conjunctival surface of the eyelids should be examined to rule out a foreign body such as a retained contact lens. In corneal abrasion, photophobia can be attributed to spastic miosis resulting from the trigeminal sensation of the cornea.","bool":true},{"option":"CT scan of the orbit","explanation":"A CT scan of the orbit is used to evaluate for an intraocular foreign body and/or an open globe injury. While patients with an intraocular foreign body or an open globe injury typically present with pain, decreased visual acuity of the affected eye, not both eyes, is also expected.

PDR develops because chronic hyperglycemia results in the death of retinal microvascular cells and capillary dysfunction, with subsequent ischemia. Dying cells release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes the growth of new fragile blood vessels (neovascularization) that hemorrhage easily and interfere with the transmission of light. Neovascularization can also cause retinal detachment and scarring. Laser photocoagulation helps reduce the progression of neovascularization and decreases the risk of vision loss. Strict glycemic and blood pressure control should be maintained in patients with PDR. Therapy with VEGF inhibitors may also be recommended, particularly in patients with significant macular edema.","bool":true},{"option":"Topical timolol therapy","explanation":"Topical timolol is used to reduce the intraocular pressure of patients with open-angle glaucoma.

Sodium bicarbonate is used to counter the cardiotoxic effects of TCAs and is indicated in patients with QRS ≥ 100 ms or ventricular arrhythmias. If an airway is established, activated charcoal can be administered within 2 hours of ingestion to prevent further absorption of TCAs. When TCA overdose is suspected but medications are unknown, a urine immunoassay can help establish the diagnosis.

Given the sudden onset of symptoms and the presence of multiple risk factors for a cerebrovascular accident, a stroke affecting the cerebellum or brainstem is the most likely cause of central AVS in this patient. Concomitant focal neurological deficits would indicate a central AVS but these deficits may not be present in inferior or midline cerebellar infarcts or lacunar brainstem lesions due to small vessel disease. If central AVS is suspected but the initial MRI is inconclusive (which can be the case for several hours after onset of AVS due to stroke), repeat MRIs should be performed.\nDemyelinating diseases of the CNS (e.g., multiple sclerosis) are a cause of central AVS in young adults and are associated with a more gradual progression of symptoms when compared to AVS due to stroke.","bool":true},{"option":"Caloric testing","explanation":"\nCaloric testing was used in the past to differentiate between central and peripheral AVS, but it is no longer used because it is cumbersome, less accurate than the HINTS test, and can worsen vertigo during testing.

The nurse states that the patient has not changed her position since she first saw her several hours ago this morning. The day before, the patient participated actively in a group psychotherapy session and took a yoga class offered in the psychiatric unit. She has a history of bipolar disorder and has been hospitalized for multiple episodes of acute mania and major depression in the past 5 years. She takes lithium for long-term maintenance treatment. Since admission, she has received several doses of haloperidol, which has gradually reduced her manic symptoms. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. The patient does not react to the physician when she is called by her name or asked to stand up from the chair. Examination shows resistance to passive limb movement.

If nonmalignant catatonia fails to respond to benzodiazepine therapy within a week, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is indicated. For malignant catatonia and for nonmalignant catatonia due to a mood disorder with psychotic features, as seen here, ECT is a first-line treatment; however, benzodiazepine therapy must still be initiated while preparations for ECT are being made. The underlying psychiatric condition must also be treated with appropriate pharmacotherapy with the exception of antipsychotic therapy (dopamine blocking drugs), which should only be initiated after catatonia resolves. Additionally, patients with catatonia should receive deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, preventive measures against pressure ulcers, adequate hydration, and if necessary, specialized nutrition support.\nIt is often difficult to distinguish malignant catatonia from neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) because both conditions typically occur in patients with psychiatric disease and manifest with fever, diaphoresis, autonomic instability, catatonic features, and similar laboratory findings (e.g., increased creatinine kinase, leukocytosis). A prodrome of excitement and agitation, the presence of symptoms when the patient is not on antipsychotics, and the absence of lead-pipe rigidity are features more consistent with malignant catatonia. In case of doubt, treat the patient for both conditions; NMS is primarily treated with dantrolene and bromocriptine and by discontinuing the causative antipsychotic.","bool":true},{"option":"Intravenous dantrolene","explanation":"\nDantrolene is not used to treat catatonia. Instead, it is indicated for malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

However, patients with NMS would have fever, diaphoresis, and autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, tachypnea).","bool":false},{"option":"Oral cyproheptadine","explanation":"Oral cyproheptadine is used to treat serotonin syndrome, which can also cause resistance to passive movements on examination (due to muscle rigidity). Features of retarded catatonia, such as waxy flexibility, posturing, mutism, and negativism, would not be expected. Instead, patients would have psychomotor agitation, neuromuscular excitability (hyperreflexia, tremors), fever, diaphoresis, and autonomic instability (tachycardia, tachypnea). Moreover, serotonin syndrome typically occurs due to a combination of two or more serotonergic drugs, e.g., antidepressants, tramadol, triptans, ondansetron, meperidine, and dextromethorphan. Haloperidol (a typical antipsychotic) and lithium are not serotonergic drugs.","bool":false},{"option":"Intramuscular aripiprazole","explanation":"\nAripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, can be used to treat manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Although treatment of the underlying psychiatric disorder is a part of the treatment of catatonia, dopamine blocking drugs such as antipsychotics should be avoided until catatonia resolves. Moreover, this patient has already experienced a decline in manic symptoms as a result of haloperidol therapy; additional antipsychotic therapy is not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous benztropine","explanation":"\nBenztropine is not used to treat catatonia but rather acute dystonia, akathisia, and bradykinesia, which are extrapyramidal side effects of typical antipsychotics like haloperidol. Acute dystonia, which occurs hours to days after initiating haloperidol, can cause muscle stiffness, abnormal position of the head and neck (due to torticollis), and speech impairment (due to spasm of the jaw, tongue and/or laryngeal muscles).

Since the middle ear communicates with the mastoid process, otitis media can result in opacification of the mastoid's air cells on imaging. However, this patient likely has an infection of the external ear, which does not communicate directly with the mastoid process and is therefore not commonly associated with opacified mastoid air cells. The mastoid can be affected if the infection spreads from the temporal bone to adjacent bones, but a different finding is much more likely in malignant otitis external.","bool":false},{"option":"Positive streptococcal culture","explanation":"\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial causes of acute otitis media.

Carbidopa is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, which decreases the peripheral conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine and, thus, increases the amount of L-DOPA that enters the central nervous system.","answers":[{"option":"Orthostatic hypotension","explanation":"Following administration, L-DOPA is absorbed into the systemic circulation where it is partially converted to dopamine by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. The remaining L-DOPA is then transported across the blood-brain barrier and enters the central nervous system to produce the desired effects. Carbidopa reduces the peripheral (systemic) conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine, thereby mitigating the peripheral side effects, including orthostatic hypotension, nausea, and vomiting.

This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional neurological deficits?","difficulty":4,"hint":"The history of a recent pelvic trauma, symptoms of perineal hypesthesia, and pain in the pelvis and genitals, as well as an absent sphincter reflex and urinary incontinence, indicate a pudendal nerve injury.","answers":[{"option":"Absent reflex erection","explanation":"The pudendal nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the perineum, external genitalia, and external urethral and anal sphincter muscles. A reflex erection occurs on tactile stimulation of the genital area, which stimulates the afferent fibers of the pudendal nerve. This activates a reflex arc with the parasympathetic nervous system at the sacral roots originating at S2 to S4, forwarding the stimulus to the inferior hypogastric plexus. This, in turn, leads to relaxation of the cavernous smooth muscle, which causes vasodilation (mediated by nitric oxide) and erection. The pudendal nerve may be injured in pelvic fractures or pelvic surgeries.","bool":true},{"option":"Impaired hip flexion","explanation":"Impaired hip flexion would be consistent with damage to the femoral nerve (paralysis of iliopsoas, pectineus, rectus femoris, and sartorius muscles). The femoral nerve can also be damaged by pelvic trauma. However, it would manifest with further motor deficits, including impaired knee extension and a decreased patellar tendon reflex (paralysis of quadriceps femoris muscle).

Other cranial nerve nuclei as well as the region of the facial nerve nucleus that innervates the forehead receive bilateral corticobulbar innervation and are therefore spared. The most common cause of stroke in this region is a lacunar stroke of the lenticulostriate artery (a branch of the middle cerebral artery).\nSince the internal capsule also contains somatosensory fibers, some patients with lacunar stroke in the internal capsule may present with sensory loss in addition to hemiparesis.

Given the unilateral onset of the tremor and the patient's age, the most likely diagnosis is Parkinson disease.","answers":[{"option":"Degeneration of the substantia nigra","explanation":"\nParkinson disease (PD) involves progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia, particularly the substantia nigra pars compacta, resulting in dopamine deficiency at the striatum. Dopamine deficiency at the striatum results in an inability of the basal ganglia to modulate the activity of the motor cortex, which in turn causes the motor symptoms (e.g., bradykinesia, resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and postural instability) that are typically seen in PD.\nSee “Common types of tremors” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Copper accumulation in the basal ganglia","explanation":"\nCopper accumulation in the basal ganglia is characteristic of Wilson disease, which can result in chronic liver disease as well as features of parkinsonism (e.g., resting tremors, bradykinesia, and rigidity).

However, asterixis is not a true tremor but rather myoclonic jerks that typically occur bilaterally in a nonrhythmic manner when the arms and hands are extended. The onset of symptoms over a period of 5 months as well as the absence of other features of decompensated liver failure (e.g., jaundice, ascites) suggest a different cause.","bool":false},{"option":"Cerebellar infarction","explanation":"\nHypertension is a risk factor for cerebellar infarction, which may result in a tremor. However, the onset of symptoms is usually acute, and the tremor seen with cerebellar dysfunction is typically an intention tremor, i.e., it worsens with goal-directed movements leading to dysmetria while performing the finger-nose test. Other signs of cerebellar dysfunction (e.g., nystagmus, abnormal gait, dysdiadochokinesia) would also be present.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased serum free T4 levels","explanation":"Levels of free T4 are increased in patients with hyperthyroidism, which may manifest with hypertension, anxiety, and tremor. However, the tremor seen in hyperthyroidism is typically bilateral, of high frequency (10–12 Hz), and does not improve with movement.","bool":false},{"option":"Infarction of the red nucleus","explanation":"\nInfarction of the red nucleus, which is seen in patients with Benedikt syndrome, can result in Holmes tremor as well as in hypertonicity on the contralateral side. However, hypertonicity associated with infarction of the red nucleus affects extensor muscles more than flexor muscles, which results in a decerebrate posture (unlike this patient who has a normal range of motion and increased resistance to both flexion and extension). Moreover, patients with Benedikt syndrome would have ataxia contralaterally (unlike this patient who has a normal finger-nose test) and features of oculomotor nerve palsy (e.g., ptosis, exotropia) ipsilaterally.","bool":false},{"option":"Conversion disorder","explanation":"Patients with a conversion disorder may develop a psychogenic tremor that may manifest as a unilateral tremor. Although this patient appears anxious, there is no history of a recent stressful event or a change in environment to suggest a conversion disorder. Moreover, unlike the tremor in this patient, which has gradually worsened over the past 5 months and is present at rest, psychogenic tremors are episodic with an abrupt onset most often (∼ 80%) in the right hand.

The incubation period usually ranges from 12 to 36 hours and, as in this patient, gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may precede neurological symptoms. Life-threatening respiratory complications can occur if the phrenic nerve is affected and patients may require mechanical ventilation. Treatment consists of close monitoring, promoting bowel emptying, and administration of botulism antitoxin.","bool":true},{"option":"Exposure to bacterial spores","explanation":"Exposure of wounds to Clostridium botulinum spores can cause wound botulism due to in-vivo production of botulinum toxin. Wound botulism presents with cranial neuropathies and descending paralysis as seen in this patient. However, it is not associated with GI symptoms but commonly involves fever and leukocytosis.

Impaired CSF absorption leads to transiently elevated intracranial pressure, which causes ventricular enlargement and compression of cerebral structures (e.g., corona radiata). Once the ventricles enlarge, homeostasis between CSF production and resorption is established and intracranial pressure normalizes.\nCSF shunting is the main treatment for NPH. The next step in the management of this patient should be to perform a lumbar tap test. Improvement of symptoms after CSF removal strongly supports the diagnosis of NPH and suggests a favorable response to CSF shunting.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased cerebrospinal fluid production","explanation":"Increased CSF production (due to choroid plexus neoplasia or inflammation) is a rare cause of communicating hydrocephalus. While communicating hydrocephalus also causes enlarged ventricles, it typically manifests with signs of intracranial hypertension (e.g, headache, nausea, vomiting) rather than the symptoms seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Obstructed passage of cerebrospinal fluid","explanation":"Obstruction of CSF flow causes non-communicating hydrocephalus.

Additionally, this patient's cranial MRI is abnormal.","bool":false},{"option":"Degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the temporal lobe","explanation":"Degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the temporal lobe is found in Alzheimer disease (AD), which commonly causes memory difficulties and enlarged ventricles on cranial MRI. Gait changes and urinary incontinence are typically found in advanced AD years after diagnosis. However, this patient's rapid onset and progression of memory and gait changes associated with urinary incontinence is unlikely to be caused by AD. Moreover, AD usually causes cerebral atrophy (particularly of the hippocampus and temporal lobe), which is not seen on this patient's MRI.","bool":false},{"option":"Multiple brain infarctions","explanation":"Multiple brain infarctions are characteristic of vascular dementia, which is the second most common form of dementia. This patient is at increased risk of developing vascular dementia given his history of smoking and hypertension, and symptom onset in vascular dementia may be relatively rapid.

While symptoms usually develop during the first 2 weeks of therapy, as seen in this patient, NMS may also develop after years of continuous therapy and without any associated increase of dose. Nonetheless, higher doses or switching antipsychotics are risk factors for the development of NMS.\nThe most important therapeutic measure is the discontinuation of the triggering substance.

Systemic manifestations, such as night sweats and weight loss, may also be observed. In some cases, collections of bacteria (tubercles) can become large enough to impede the typical flow of CSF in the cranium, leading to hydrocephalus. While this patient's MRI demonstrates hydrocephalus, the absence of other clinical findings (fever, systemic symptoms, neck pain) and clear risk factors for M. tuberculosis infection (e.g., immigration from an endemic area, pulmonary manifestations of TB) make this very unlikely. Also, there is no evidence of tubercles on this patient's MRI.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Intraventricular hemorrhage","explanation":"\nIntraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) manifests with headache, vomiting, and altered sensorium.

This complication is typically seen in neonates of &lt; 1500 g birth weight and born before 32 weeks' gestation due to the fragility of the germinal matrix. Additional risk factors include peripartal chorioamnionitis and hypoxia (as suggested by this patient's low Apgar scores). Most infants with IVH are asymptomatic, but saltatory (over several days) or, more rarely, catastrophic (over minutes to hours) courses are also possible. Symptoms include lethargy, hypotonia, irregular respirations, bulging anterior fontanelle, and neurologic symptoms (e.g., seizures, cranial nerve abnormalities as suggested by poor pupillary light reflexes and roving eye movements), all of which this patient has.\nCranial ultrasonography is the preferred method to diagnose IVH in newborns.

The presence of gram-negative diplococci on CSF analysis indicates that the causal organism is Neisseria meningitidis.","answers":[{"option":"Adhesive pili","explanation":"\nPili and certain proteins, e.g., opacity proteins, are important virulence factors for N. meningitidis as they allow the bacterium to adhere to and invade epithelial and endothelial cells. Colonization of the nasal epithelium is considered the first crucial step leading to clinically apparent infection. In a small proportion of individuals colonized with N. meningitidis, the bacteria invade the bloodstream and gain access to the brain, presumably via the brain postcapillary venules or the choroid plexus, to cause meningeal infection.\nN.  meningitidis is transmitted via respiratory or oral secretions of asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the organism. Living in crowded spaces, such as college dormitories, is an important risk factor for transmission.","bool":true},{"option":"Polysaccharide capsule","explanation":"\nN. meningitidis has a polysaccharide capsule that plays a vital role in its pathogenicity by protecting it from antibody-/complement-mediated killing and inhibiting phagocytosis.

After cellular lysis or endocytosis, LOS are released into the serum. There, they strongly stimulate macrophages, tissue factor, and complement. These pathways ultimately lead to the clinical signs of shock such as fever, hypotension, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. N. meningitidis releases endotoxin, but relatively late in the course of invasive infection. Lipooligosaccharides are, therefore, not a crucial part of the first step in meningeal infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Protein A","explanation":"\nProtein A is not produced by N. meningitidis. Rather, it is a potent virulence factor produced by S. aureus, a gram-positive coccus that arranges in clusters. N. meningitidis, however, does produce IgA protease.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient's medical history and vital signs point to a complication of an underlying condition that is usually asymptomatic.","answers":[{"option":"Hypertensive emergency","explanation":"The combination of severe hypertension (systolic ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic ≥ 120 mm Hg) and signs of acute end-organ damage are highly concerning for a hypertensive emergency. This patient presents with significantly elevated blood pressure and signs of both severe hypertensive retinopathy (formerly referred to as “malignant hypertension”) and hypertensive encephalopathy (headache, nausea, vomiting). A hypertensive emergency requires immediate treatment to prevent further end-organ damage. Generally, blood pressure must be lowered slowly, as vessels will have adjusted to hypertension and rapid drops in blood pressure (even if it remains within normal limits) can induce ischemia. A common approach is mean arterial pressure reduction by 10–20% in the first hour and another 5–15% over the following 23 hours.","bool":true},{"option":"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension","explanation":"\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) typically causes headache in (often overweight) women of childbearing age. While IIH can present with additional symptoms of papilledema, nausea, and vomiting, its onset is not acute and it would be very unlikely in a 72-year-old woman. Moreover, IIH often presents with visual field loss and abducens nerve palsy, which are absent in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Ischemic stroke","explanation":"\nIschemic stroke causes acute unilateral limb numbness, weakness, and/or cranial nerve deficits (e.g., facial droop). While this patient is at high risk of stroke (due to her age and history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus), she has no focal neurologic deficits. Moreover, ischemic strokes do not usually cause headaches since brain tissue lacks sensation. Finally, papilledema (suggesting intracranial hypertension) is not typically seen in ischemic stroke.","bool":false},{"option":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage","explanation":"\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) classically presents with hyperacute thunderclap headache. Patients present with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, and meningismus. This patient presents with acute nausea and vomiting, but her history does not suggest thunderclap headache and she has no signs of meningismus. Her ongoing throbbing headache, which she had for hours, is not consistent with SAH.","bool":false},{"option":"Transient ischemic attack","explanation":"\nTransient ischemic attack (TIA) presents with acute, focal neurologic deficits that self-resolve within less than 24 hours (most last &lt; 1 hour).

Although this patient is at high risk for TIA (given her age and history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus), it would not present with headache or papilledema.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Migraine headache","explanation":"\nMigraine headaches usually manifest as recurrent, acute, unilateral, throbbing/pulsatile headaches and are sometimes associated with an aura, nausea, and/or vomiting. While this patient has headache, nausea, and vomiting, she has no history of migraine or recurrent headaches, and the new onset of migraine in an older adult is unlikely. Moreover, migraine would not explain this patient's papilledema.","bool":false},{"option":"Giant cell arteritis","explanation":"\nGiant cell arteritis (GCA) is an important cause of headache that should always be considered in patients of advanced age. While this patient is 72-years-old and presents with new headache, she lacks other expected findings of GCA (e.g., jaw claudication, temporal tenderness, constitutional symptoms).

This information is necessary to guide further management and abscess evacuation (e.g., trajectory planning for a burr hole procedure and stereotactic aspiration). The treatment of an intracranial abscess consists of urgent abscess evacuation to decompress the cranial cavity (especially if the patient has an abscess &gt; 2.5 cm in size or evidence of increased ICP) and early empiric antibiotic therapy with metronidazole, ceftriaxone, and, possibly, vancomycin. Antibiotic therapy alone can be considered if the patient has a very small brain abscess (&lt; 1 cm) and no evidence of increased ICP.","bool":true},{"option":"Cefazolin and clindamycin therapy","explanation":"\nClindamycin and cefazolin are not appropriate antibiotics for a patient suspected to have an intracranial infection because these antibiotics have relatively poor CNS penetration. Instead, metronidazole and ceftriaxone are typically used.

Most cases of post-parotidectomy facial nerve palsy resolve within one month.\nBecause parotid adenoid cystic carcinomas of the parotid gland grow along nerve sheaths, the facial nerve cannot always be preserved during parotidectomy.","bool":true},{"option":"Xerostomia when eating","explanation":"The parotid gland produces ∼ 40% of the saliva and is stimulated by eating. The total amount of saliva is therefore likely to be slightly decreased after parotidectomy. However, given the continued production of saliva from the remaining salivary glands, xerostomia is not a common complication of the procedure.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperesthesia of the right ear lobe","explanation":"The sensation of the ear lobe is provided by the greater auricular nerve. Hypoesthesia, not hyperesthesia, of the greater auricular nerve is a common complication of parotidectomy due to nerve transection during surgery.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperacusis of the right ear","explanation":"\nHyperacusis can be a symptom of facial nerve dysfunction (e.g., Bell palsy) due to consequent weakness of the stapedius muscle. The nerve to the stapedius branches off from the facial nerve before the facial nerve exits the skull, which means that stapedius dysfunction cannot be a complication of parotidectomy.","bool":false},{"option":"Flushing and sweating of the right cheek while eating","explanation":"Flushing and sweating of the cheek while eating is characteristic of Frey syndrome, which is a common complication of parotidectomy that results in surgical injury of parasympathetic nerve fibers.

As the disease progresses, cognitive and behavioral changes occur that manifest as dementia with primarily impaired executive functioning and depression with suicidal tendencies. As HD progresses, both direct and indirect pathways become affected. Movement dysfunction then transforms into a hypokinetic/akinetic movement disorder, including dystonia (e.g. delayed return to neutral with plantar reflex) and motor impersistence (e.g. inability to maintain tongue protrusion). Hallucinations can be present at any stage of the disease. HD classically is associated with genetic anticipation.

On fundoscopic examination, the neurosensory retina is detached from the retinal pigment epithelium on the temporal side, resulting in a corrugated, opaque appearance compared to the intact medial side. The most frequent causes of RD are tears or holes in the retina (rhegmatogenous RD); less commonly, RD can occur without a retinal tear (nonrhegmatogenous RD). Risk factors include high myopia, trauma (in this case, likely caused by jumping on a trampoline), previous intraocular surgery, and posterior vitreous detachment.\nThe prognosis in RD is good if surgery is performed at an early stage and if there is no macular involvement. Without treatment, progressive RD causes blindness, especially if the macula is involved.","bool":true},{"option":"Impaired drainage of aqueous humor from the eye","explanation":"Impaired drainage of aqueous humor from the eye is the underlying cause of acute angle-closure glaucoma.

Intravenous lorazepam is administered and she is admitted to the intensive care unit. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\n","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient had a brief recovery of consciousness (lucid interval) after experiencing head trauma, but now has signs of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), including nausea, headache, vomiting, seizure, and Cushing triad (hypertension, bradycardia, and bradypnea). All of these features suggest intracranial hemorrhage most likely due to rupture of the middle meningeal artery.","answers":[{"option":"Epidural hematoma","explanation":"An epidural hematoma should be suspected in any patient with severe head trauma and initial loss of consciousness that is followed by a lucid interval and then soon after by a new decline in mental status with signs of elevated ICP. The lucid interval represents the time it takes for blood to accumulate in the epidural space before compressing the brain and resulting in clinical deterioration. The length of the lucid interval depends on the severity of the trauma and the intensity of the bleeding and is typically shorter in patients with bleeding from the meningeal arteries compared to patients who bleed from a torn bridging vein (as seen with subdural hematomas).","bool":true},{"option":"Subdural hematoma","explanation":"Onset of symptoms in patients with subdural hematoma (SDH) depends on the size, location, and rate of growth of the SDH. In acute onset, the patient may also present with headache and signs of increased ICP immediately following head trauma. In rare cases, patients may also experience a lucid interval. However, the temporary recovery of consciousness is more commonly associated with a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Intracerebral hemorrhage","explanation":"\nIntracerebral hemorrhage typically results from a spontaneous (i.e., nontraumatic) rupture of vessels secondary to structural changes of the vessel walls, e.g., in chronic hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Patients present with headache and focal neurologic deficits, such as hemiparesis. Rarely, it is caused by a head trauma with direct damage of the vessel. Signs of increased ICP and a lucid interval are more suggestive of another diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Subarachnoidal hemorrhage","explanation":"Subarachnoidal hemorrhages may occur spontaneously or after head trauma. Patients typically present with sudden, excruciating headaches (thunderclap headache), meningism, and loss of consciousness. While this patient also experienced headache and a loss of consciousness, signs of elevated ICP and the momentary recovery of consciousness point to another diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension","explanation":"\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) usually presents with chronic headaches and visual symptoms (e.g., transient loss of vision) that gradually worsens over months to years. It is not associated with head trauma. While this patient is in the peak age group of IIH (15–45 years of age), she developed her symptoms rapidly following a traumatic event and does not have any visual symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Ischemic stroke","explanation":"Symptoms of ischemic stroke depend on the affected area of the brain. Patients typically present with focal neurological deficits like hemiparesis and have risk factors such as diabetes or hypercholesterolemia.

The most likely cause of this patient's condition is a tumor in which of the following locations?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient presents with vertical gaze palsy and signs of increased intracranial pressure (papilledema). These findings are suggestive of a brain tumor that is causing compression symptoms due to hydrocephalus. Signs of precocious puberty are due to the tumor cell line.","answers":[{"option":"Dorsal midbrain","explanation":"\nPinealoma is a childhood tumor of the dorsal midbrain that compresses the pretectal region, resulting in vertical gaze palsy. Because of the close proximity to the cerebral aqueduct, hydrocephalus (due to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow pathway) can also develop, which would explain this patient's increased intracranial pressure. The most common type of pinealoma in children is germinoma, which often secretes β-hCG, stimulating testosterone production and causing precocious puberty in boys.\nOther causes of vertical gaze palsy include stroke, multiple sclerosis, and encephalitis.","bool":true},{"option":"Fourth ventricle","explanation":"\nEpendymomas are childhood tumors that are typically located in the fourth ventricle. This tumor most commonly presents with noncommunicating hydrocephalus, which can result in compression of a number of CNS structures and cause vertical gaze palsy and central precocious puberty. However, in the case of hydrocephalus due to an ependymoma, symptoms of hydrocephalus (e.g., irritability, urinary incontinence) would precede the onset of vertical gaze palsy unlike this patient who had a vertical gaze palsy before the onset of hydrocephalus symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Sella turcica","explanation":"\nPituitary tumors arise within the sella turcica. These tumors can cause compression of the optic chiasm and manifest with bitemporal hemianopsia. Because the pituitary gland is not in close proximity to the ventricular system, hydrocephalus does not occur. In addition, pituitary tumors originating from gonadotropic cells (gonadotroph adenoma) are typically nonsecretory (inactive), resulting in hypogonadism due to the destruction of functioning gonadotropic cells, instead of precocious puberty.","bool":false},{"option":"Cerebellar vermis","explanation":"\nPilocytic astrocytoma and medulloblastoma are childhood tumors located in the cerebellar vermis. Hydrocephalus due to compression of the fourth ventricle by these tumors can cause vertical gaze palsy and central precocious puberty. However, in the case of hydrocephalus due to either of these tumors, symptoms of hydrocephalus (e.g., irritability, urinary incontinence) would precede the onset of vertical gaze palsy unlike this patient who had a vertical gaze palsy before the onset of hydrocephalus symptoms. Additionally, compression of the cerebellar vermis would cause truncal ataxia, which is not reported in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Cerebellopontine angle","explanation":"\nAcoustic schwannoma is the most common tumor of the cerebellopontine angle. Compression of structures adjacent to the cerebellopontine angle can cause hydrocephalus, but the absence of vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) involvement (causes unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, unsteady gait) in this patient and the relatively short clinical course (4 weeks) make acoustic schwannoma (a slow-growing tumor) an unlikely etiology. Furthermore, the median age of patients presenting with acoustic schwannoma is ∼ 50 years.","bool":false},{"option":"Cerebral falx","explanation":"\nMeningiomas often arise in the cerebral falx and are typically asymptomatic due to their slow growth rate. Compression of the adjacent hemisphere can cause seizures as well as spastic paraparesis and incontinence.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":1,"hint":"The presence of headaches and a brain mass in a woman who was treated previously for breast cancer is suspicious for a brain metastasis.","answers":[{"option":"Surgical resection","explanation":"\nSurgical resection has been shown to improve both survival and quality of life in patients with a single brain metastasis. This patient is a good surgical candidate as she has a good functional status with no evidence of other metastases, and her tumor is surgically accessible (near the surface of the brain). The goal of surgery is twofold: symptomatic relief (i.e. reduction of this patient's headaches) and local control (i.e. prevention of local recurrence). Postoperative focal radiation is commonly employed to reduce the local recurrence risk, although there are doubts as to whether this improves overall survival.","bool":true},{"option":"Chemotherapy","explanation":"\nChemotherapy is a useful palliative treatment modality for patients with multiple or recurrent brain metastases.

However, about half of these patients also have fever or neurologic deficits. Often brain abscesses arise via hematogenous or direct spread, so many of the patients affected will have a concurrent infection. Although brain abscesses can also arise without concurrent infection, this patient's recent history of breast cancer increases the likelihood that her brain lesion is a metastatic tumor (that would not respond to antibiotics).","bool":false},{"option":"Whole brain radiation therapy","explanation":"\nWhole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the treatment of choice for patients with either multiple brain metastases or a poor prognosis. Consequences of WBRT include fatigue and alopecia in addition to neurocognitive deterioration months after therapy. Since this patient has a single metastasis with good functional status and no systemic disease, WBRT would not be indicated at this time. While WBRT was once commonly used following surgical resection to minimize local recurrence, focal radiation therapy (which has far fewer side effects) has largely replaced this treatment modality in postoperative patients.","bool":false},{"option":"Palliative care","explanation":"\nPalliative care may be indicated in patients with a high tumor burden, poor prognosis, and/or poor functional status. Patients with a single brain metastasis tend to have a poor overall prognosis (&lt; 3 months survival without treatment), but surgical resection can significantly reduce symptoms and increase survival to ∼ 1 year.

In ACS, proprioception and vibration sense are preserved because the posterior spinal arteries provide blood supply to the dorsal columns. The thoracolumbar segment of the spinal cord is a watershed area and is, therefore, the most common site of infarction, as seen here.\nACS may occur as a complication of an aortic aneurysm itself or iatrogenically during the repair of the aneurysm (due to damage to the anterior spinal artery and/or artery of Adamkiewicz). Other causes of ACS include trauma (e.g., penetrating injury), hypotension (e.g., from severe hemorrhage), and compression (e.g., tumors, cervical spondylosis).","bool":true},{"option":"Spinal epidural hematoma","explanation":"\nSpinal epidural hematoma (SEH) can cause acute spinal cord compression and manifest as back pain and lower extremity weakness and numbness, as seen in this patient.

The naevus flammeus may be treated with laser therapy.\nSee “Overview of neurocutaneous syndromes” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia","explanation":"A diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) requires at least two of the following criteria: epistaxis, telangiectasias, visceral lesions, or a first-degree relative with HHT. Telangiectasias associated with HHT can have macular appearance similar to the lesion seen in this patient, but telangiectasias are more commonly found on the lips, tongue, buccal mucosa, and fingertips. Seizures and developmental delay are not seen in the syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Neurofibromatosis type 1","explanation":"\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can rarely manifest with infantile seizures. However, café au lait spots or macules associated with NF1 are usually brown rather than purple or red. The diagnosis of NF1 requires any two of the following: six or more café au lait spots, at least two neurofibromas, axillary or inguinal freckling, optic gliomas, Lisch nodules on the iris, a distinctive bony lesion (e.g., sphenoid dysplasia, cortical thinning of long bones), or a family history of NF1 in a first-degree relative.","bool":false},{"option":"Tuberous sclerosis","explanation":"\nTuberous sclerosis can present with infantile seizures, developmental delay, and ash-leaf spots on physical examination. However, unlike the purple-red facial patch in this patient, the ash-leaf macule of tuberous sclerosis is hypopigmented, does not blanch with pressure, and more commonly occurs on the trunk or extremities.","bool":false},{"option":"Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome","explanation":"\nKlippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) may cause a naevus flammeus, but it usually occurs in the lower extremities. KTS is also associated with varicosities and hypertrophy of the limb with the naevus flammeus.","bool":false},{"option":"Ataxia telangiectasia","explanation":"While ataxia telangiectasia also causes facial skin changes, it usually manifests after 3 years of age with telangiectasias on the bulbar conjunctiva, the nasal bridge, the malar areas, external ears, and hard palate. This patient also does not have any other common manifestations of ataxia telangiectasia such as ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and recurrent infections (due to immunodeficiency). Additionally, glaucoma, buphthalmos, and developmental delay are not typically seen in the condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome","explanation":"While Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) can manifest in infants with a facial naevus flammeus, other features of this condition, such as macroglossia or overgrowth (&gt; 97th percentile for height and weight) are not present in this patient. BWS also does not usually cause neurologic deficits or significant developmental delay.","bool":false},{"option":"Von Hippel-Lindau disease","explanation":"\nVon Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is characterized by the formation of tumors, including hemangioblastomas and fluid-filled cysts in different parts of the body. The formation of hemangioblastomas in the brain may lead to neurological deficits and focal seizures, but the onset of symptoms occurs later in life, typically in young adulthood. The condition is not associated with the skin lesions seen in this patient.","bool":false}]},{"id":302,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive worsening of vision in both eyes over the past 6 months. The patient reports that during this period he has had blurry vision and a glare in the evenings. He works as a tower crane operator and spends most of his day outdoors. Ophthalmologic examination shows visual acuity of 20/100 in both eyes. A photograph of the left eye is shown. Damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's current symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The photograph shows leukocoria (white pupillary reflex). Chronic UV exposure (e.g., from working outdoors) is a risk factor for this patient's condition.","answers":[{"option":"Lens","explanation":"\nGradual, painless loss of vision, glare, and leukocoria in an adult is consistent with cataract. Symptoms develop secondary to clouding of the lens. Cataracts often occur bilaterally and are the most common cause of impaired vision in individuals over 40 years of age. Besides chronic UV exposure, other risk factors for cataracts include advanced age, diabetes mellitus, smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, chronic corticosteroid therapy, and ocular trauma.\nConditions associated with congenital and juvenile cataracts include galactosemia, chromosomal trisomies, certain TORCH infections (e.g., rubella, toxoplasmosis), Marfan syndrome, Alport syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and neurofibromatosis type II.","bool":true},{"option":"Retina","explanation":"Retinal pathologies such as retinoblastoma, retrolental fibroplasia, and Coats disease can cause leukocoria with impaired visual acuity. However, these conditions typically occur in children.","bool":false},{"option":"Cornea","explanation":"Corneal edema, which can be caused by keratitis, anterior uveitis, acute closed-angle glaucoma, and certain metabolic disorders (e.g., mucopolysaccharidoses), would appear as opacifications on slit-lamp examination and cause impaired visual acuity. However, such opacifications would not be restricted to the pupillary area, as is the case here. Instead, opacification would be present throughout the cornea and obscure the underlying iris.","bool":false},{"option":"Vitreous body","explanation":"\nVitreous body pathologies, such as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) and chronic ocular toxocariasis, can result in impaired visual acuity and leukocoria. However, PHPV typically occurs during childhood, and toxocariasis is accompanied by ocular pain. Moreover, both conditions are typically unilateral, whereas both eyes are affected in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Aqueous humor","explanation":"Opacification of the aqueous humor typically occurs in acute uveitis, a condition in which pus accumulates in the anterior chamber (hypopyon). However, opacification would not be restricted to the pupillary area, as seen here. Instead, it would be present in the inferior region of the anterior chamber and obscure the underlying iris. Moreover, the chronic nature of the patient's symptoms and the absence of pain and conjunctival injection make a different kind of ocular damage more likely.","bool":false}]},{"id":303,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful double vision for the past 3 days. Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and horizontal nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and horizontal nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Convergence testing shows no abnormalities. Fundoscopy shows bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?","difficulty":1,"hint":"Impaired adduction of the ipsilateral eye and abduction nystagmus of the contralateral eye (i.e., dissociated nystagmus) on lateral horizontal gaze should raise concern for internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), in which convergence is usually preserved. This patient's findings are consistent with bilateral INO. In addition, painful eye movements and hyperemia of the optic discs suggest optic neuritis.","answers":[{"option":"Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus","explanation":"\nBilateral INO, optic neuritis, and ataxia (loss of balance) in a young woman should raise concern for multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) can lead to INO. In younger patients, MS is the most common cause of INO. In older patients (especially those with arteriosclerotic risk factors), INO is more commonly caused by ischemic infarction and manifests with unilateral findings and additional stroke findings. All patients with INO should undergo MRI of the brain.","bool":true},{"option":"Infarction of the brainstem","explanation":"\nBrainstem infarction is the most common cause of INO in older patients. It is most likely in patients with vascular risk factors (e.g., obesity, smoking, factor V Leiden) and usually causes unilateral, not bilateral, INO with other stroke findings (e.g., unilateral hemiparesis, cranial nerve abnormalities). This patient has a very low risk of stroke, and another cause or INO is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Compressive tumor of the pons","explanation":"A compressive tumor in the pons (e.g., pontine glioma) may cause bilateral INO if it compresses the structure responsible for conjugate horizontal gaze. Furthermore, this patient's episode of balance difficulties is consistent with a brainstem tumor. However, it would be rare for these tumors to cause INO in isolation, as they usually also cause additional cranial nerve abnormalities (e.g., dysarthria, dysphagia, facial sensory loss) and other neurological changes (ataxia and upper motor neuron lesions). Finally, brainstem gliomas are much more common in individuals under the age of 20 years.","bool":false},{"option":"Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency","explanation":"Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency is the underlying mechanism of Wernicke encephalopathy, a condition that causes ophthalmoplegia and balance difficulties. However, this condition usually presents with more severe cognitive symptoms such as delirium and occurs primarily in patients with alcohol use disorder and/or those with nutritional deficiencies, neither of which is seen in this patient. Though the ophthalmoplegia seen in Wernicke encephalopathy may be similar to INO, it usually causes lateral gaze nystagmus without adduction difficulties.","bool":false},{"option":"Caudal displacement of cerebellar vermis","explanation":"\nCaudal displacement of the cerebellar vermis occurs in patients with Chiari II malformation, a condition that usually causes hydrocephalus secondary to stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius and may cause cerebellar signs (e.g., ataxia). While this patient has signs of balance problems, Chiari II malformation is almost always seen in conjunction with a lumbosacral or thoracic meningomyelocele, so it is often detected at birth. Based on her history alone, this adult patient is very unlikely to have this diagnosis. Moreover, Chiari II malformation does not cause INO.","bool":false},{"option":"Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit","explanation":"\nSubdural hematomas can cause elevated intracranial pressure and headache following traumatic injury. Most cases of subdural hematoma cause headaches, confusion, nausea, or vomiting several days to weeks after trauma, none of which are seen in this patient. Although INO caused by subdural hematomas have been described in case reports, it is an exceedingly rare phenomenon, especially in a patient without any other signs of subdural hematoma (e.g., altered mental status, headache).","bool":false},{"option":"Antibodies against acetylcholine receptors","explanation":"\nAntibodies against acetylcholine receptors cause myasthenia gravis (MG). MG may manifest initially with painless diplopia and ptosis due to ocular muscle fatigue, which is characteristically worse at the end of the day or with exercise.

She has not had any trauma. Neurologic examination shows bilateral lower extremity weakness. Stroking the lateral side of the sole of the foot from the heel to the base of the small toe and medially to the base of the big toe elicits dorsiflexion of the big toe and fanning of the other toes. Further examination of this patient is most likely to show which of the following additional findings?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient has a positive Babinski sign (extension of the hallux with abduction of all toes), which indicates damage to the corticospinal tract (i.e., upper motor neurons).","answers":[{"option":"Spasticity","explanation":"\nMuscle spasticity is due to hyperexcitable tonic reflexes and occurs when upper motor neuron (UMN) regulation of alpha motor neurons is lost, which leads to net disinhibition of the spinal reflexes. The Babinski reflex is a primitive reflex mediated by the extrapyramidal tracts. It is lost progressively as the pyramidal tracts gain functionality through increasing myelination. As such, a positive Babinski reflex is normal in children up to 1 year of age, after which time it is usually suppressed by the pyramidal tracts.\nIn combination with urinary incontinence, signs of upper motor neuron damage in an otherwise healthy young woman raise suspicion of multiple sclerosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Fasciculation","explanation":"Isolated fasciculations without further medical signs are benign but indicate lower motor neuron damage if they are accompanied by muscle weakness. Muscle fasciculations would be unlikely in this patient, given that her examination indicates upper motor neuron damage (positive Babinski reflex).","bool":false},{"option":"Atrophy","explanation":"In combination with muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles isolated to a specific root or peripheral nerve suggests damage to the lower motor neurons. However, a positive Babinski sign points to upper motor neuron damage.","bool":false},{"option":"Palmar grasp reflex","explanation":"The palmar grasp reflex is a primitive reflex elicited in infants that persists until 3–6 months of age. A positive palmar grasp reflex in an adult may be a sign of frontal lobe damage (frontal release sign). It does not indicate upper motor neuron damage.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyporeflexia","explanation":"A decrease in the activity of a reflex arc points to injuries in the efferent arm of the loop (i.e., lower motor neuron damage).

According to his girlfriend, he has had fatigue for the last 3 days and became confused this morning, after which he started having uncontrollable convulsions throughout his entire body. He was unconscious throughout the episode which lasted for about 4 minutes. He has not visited a physician for over 10 years. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 12 years. His girlfriend admits that they occasionally use heroin with their friends. His temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), pulse is 93/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation; examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. He appears somnolent but is cooperative. There are multiple track marks on both of his arms. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 3,000/mm3, a hematocrit of 34%, a platelet count of 354,000/mm3, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 27 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 84/mm3. A CT scan of the head is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step given this patient's CT scan findings?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient's history of intravenous drug use along with a low CD4 count are consistent with HIV infection. New-onset seizure and CT scan showing ring-enhancing lesions in a patient with HIV infection strongly suggest cerebral toxoplasmosis.","answers":[{"option":"Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin","explanation":"The preferred treatment regimen for cerebral toxoplasmosis consists of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin (folinic acid). Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine inhibit folic acid metabolism in T. gondii, while folinic acid alleviates myelotoxic side effects. Alternative treatment regimens (e.g., trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, atovaquone) may also be used in patients who have a sulfa allergy or do not tolerate first-line medications. Anticonvulsants to treat seizures and corticosteroids for cerebral edema can be used as adjunctive therapy.\nPatients with cerebral toxoplasmosis should undergo HIV testing to confirm the diagnosis and begin antiretroviral therapy (cART). Restoration of the immune system following initiation of cART can result in immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), especially in severely immunocompromised patients. In patients with opportunistic infections, cART should be initiated within two weeks or as soon as the patient is clinically stable, with subsequent monitoring for the development of IRIS.","bool":true},{"option":"Ceftriaxone and vancomycin","explanation":"A combination of vancomycin and ceftriaxone is used to empirically treat bacterial meningitis in adults &lt; 50 years of age. Bacterial meningitis may manifest with an altered mental status and seizures and result in brain abscess, which can cause a ring-enhancing lesion, especially in immunocompromised patients. However, the presence of multiple lesions and involvement of the basal ganglia are more characteristic of cerebral toxoplasmosis, which is the most common cause of ring-enhancing lesions in patients with HIV infection.","bool":false},{"option":"CT-guided stereotactic aspiration","explanation":"CT-guided stereotactic aspiration may be indicated in the management of cerebral abscess, primary CNS lymphoma, and cerebral toxoplasmosis, which are the most important differential diagnoses in patients with HIV infection and ring-enhancing cerebral lesions. Although distinguishing between these conditions is difficult because of similarities in clinical presentation and neuroimaging, the presence of multiple lesions and involvement of the basal ganglia are more characteristic of cerebral toxoplasmosis, which is the most common cause of ring-enhancing lesions in patients with HIV infection. CT-guided aspiration should only be performed for suspected cerebral toxoplasmosis if the patient does not respond to initial therapy within 2 weeks.","bool":false},{"option":"Amphotericin B and flucytosine","explanation":"\nAmphotericin B and flucytosine are antifungal agents used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, which typically occurs in patients with HIV infection and has a subacute onset with low-grade fever, fatigue, and headaches. Cryptococcal meningitis is typically diagnosed with serum antigen testing and CSF analysis and culture. Although this patient is at risk for cryptococcal infection, his ring-enhancing cerebral lesions make toxoplasmosis a more likely diagnosis. Toxoplasmosis is caused by protozoa; therefore, antifungals would not be effective in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Chemotherapy and radiation","explanation":"\nChemotherapy and radiation are used to treat primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), which typically manifests with headache, neurological deficits, and personality changes and may cause seizures. PCNSL is the second most common cause of ring-enhancing cerebral lesions in patients with HIV infection; however, it manifests with a solitary lesion whereas this patient has several. A CT scan showing multiple ring-enhancing lesions is characteristic of cerebral toxoplasmosis, which is the leading cause of these lesions in patients with HIV infection. CSF analysis in patients with PCNSL would also be positive for EBV DNA; diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole","explanation":"\nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) therapy can be used as an alternative treatment for patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis, but it is not the preferred regimen. This combination is typically used if first-line medications are not available or in patients who cannot take them. For example, because the preferred regimen is given orally, parenteral TMP/SMX is used in patients who do not tolerate oral therapy. TMP/SMX therapy is also used as chemoprophylaxis for toxoplasmosis reactivation and Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with HIV infection.","bool":false}]},{"id":306,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A previously healthy 51-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of confusion for the last 4 hours. His wife reports that 4 days ago, he had a bicycle accident in which he collided with another cyclist and was not wearing a helmet. On arrival, he is unconscious. The right pupil is dilated and fixed; the left pupil is round and reactive to light. An MRI scan of the brain shows a large right-sided subdural hematoma (SDH), right uncal transtentorial herniation, and compression of the left cerebral peduncle against the tentorial notch. Which of the following additional findings would be most likely in this patient?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Compression of the cerebral peduncle contralateral to the uncal herniation may result in false localizing signs.","answers":[{"option":"Right-sided hemiplegia","explanation":"This patient's transtentorial uncal herniation is most likely caused by the mass effect exerted by the SDH. Initially, the displaced uncus exerts pressure primarily on the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle and oculomotor nerve, possibly resulting in contralateral hemiparesis (due to compression of the corticospinal tract) and ipsilateral fixed and dilated pupil (Hutchinson pupil), respectively. As herniation develops, the contralateral cerebral peduncle and oculomotor nerve are pushed against the contralateral tentorial notch, resulting in paradoxical ipsilateral hemiparesis and contralateral Hutchinson pupil. This combination of false localizing signs is called Kernohan phenomenon.\nAs herniation progresses, the brainstem may be compressed and caudally displaced, shearing the vessels and leading to midbrain and pontine hemorrhages, which result in coma, apnea, impaired circulation, and death.","bool":true},{"option":"Asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss","explanation":"Asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss can be caused by various conditions and can have an acute or gradual onset. Meniere disease is the most common cause of acute asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss, whereas other conditions (e.g., tumors) can lead to gradual asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss. SDH with uncal herniation does not commonly result in asymmetric hearing loss.","bool":false},{"option":"Left-sided tongue deviation","explanation":"Deviation of the tongue when protruded can be caused by compression syndromes and other neurological lesions, and the tongue typically deviates to the affected side. Tongue deviation results from damage to the hypoglossal nucleus, which is located in the medulla rather than the cerebral peduncle. Compression of the hypoglossal nucleus is therefore commonly associated with skull base fractures, neoplasms, and strokes, and is rarely seen in uncal herniation with cerebral peduncle compression.","bool":false},{"option":"Convergence-retraction nystagmus","explanation":"\nConvergence-retraction nystagmus can be seen in dorsal midbrain syndrome (Parinaud syndrome). Upon attempting to look upward, the eyes converge and retract into the orbit.

The resulting cell damage leads to encephalopathy-like symptoms, such as nausea, headaches, confusion, and seizures, none of which are seen in this patient. However, chronic hyperglycemic patients may have osmotic-related peripheral nerve damage due to sorbitol accumulation. Glucose is often trapped within cells through conversion to sorbitol via aldose reductase.

The lateral corticospinal tract decussates at the level of the medulla. An injury distal to the decussation (e.g., at the level of T1) would, therefore, affect ipsilateral motor function below the level of the injury. In a full Brown-Sequard syndrome (e.g., hemisection of the spinal cord), there would also be ipsilateral loss of vibration and proprioception below T1 (dorsal column), ipsilateral Babinski sign (lateral corticospinal tract), and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation beginning two levels below the lesion (lateral spinothalamic tract).","bool":true},{"option":"Presence of left-sided Babinski sign","explanation":"The Babinski sign usually takes 1–2 weeks to appear after an upper motor neuron lesion occurs.

TP is a self-limiting postictal focal paresis or paralysis that can last from a few minutes up to 36 hours and affects half of the body or one limb. TP may develop after any type of seizure but usually occurs after focal seizures with or without secondary generalization. Because of the abrupt interruption in his chronic alcohol use, this patient most likely experienced alcohol withdrawal seizures, which typically arise 8–48 hours after cessation or a significant decrease in consumption.\nDiagnosis is usually clinical, and it is important to distinguish TP from stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Although all of these conditions can cause headaches, aphasia, and limb weakness, muscle pain is not typical in stroke or TIA, and neurological symptoms typically localize to a single vascular territory. Diffusion-weighted MRI helps to differentiate between TP and stroke and identifies ischemia within 30 min after onset while also allowing detection of hyperacute hemorrhage.","bool":true},{"option":"Transient ischemic attack","explanation":"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) may manifest with headache, slurred speech, and focal neurological deficits along with normal brain MRI findings. Also, individuals with alcohol use disorder, such as this patient, are at increased risk for TIAs. However, TIA typically lasts for less than one hour, and neurological symptoms usually localize to a single vascular territory rather than multiple. For example, left arm weakness localizes to the right precentral gyrus, and expressive aphasia localizes to the left hemisphere in the vast majority of right-handed individuals with TIA. Furthermore, TIAs rarely cause altered mental status and unconsciousness.","bool":false},{"option":"Intracranial hemorrhage","explanation":"Depending on the location and extent of bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) may manifest with headache, altered mental status, focal neurological deficits, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Also, individuals with hypertension, such as this patient, are at increased risk for ICH.

Furthermore, an intracranial hemorrhage would have been seen on neuroimaging.","bool":false},{"option":"Syncope","explanation":"\nSyncope can result in a transient loss of consciousness from inadequate brain perfusion and subsequently manifest with generalized weakness or fatigue. However, syncopal episodes usually do not cause prolonged confusion or neurological deficits (e.g., speech impairment, left arm weakness), and consciousness is usually regained within minutes.","bool":false},{"option":"Cardiac arrhythmia","explanation":"A cardiac arrhythmia can cause a syncopal episode if there is inadequate perfusion to the brain. Although this patient is at increased risk of arrhythmia because of left ventricular hypertrophy, he does not have symptoms suggesting a cardiac etiology (e.g., palpitations, chest pain).

The muddy taste in her mouth (gustatory aura) marks the onset of the seizure. The ictal phase consists of her staring, nonresponsiveness to external stimuli, and automatisms such as facial grimacing and hand gestures. The ictal phase is typically followed by postictal confusion, lethargy, and amnesia.\nSee “Differential diagnosis of epilepsy” table.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Syncope","explanation":"\nSyncope may result in unresponsiveness due to a transient loss of consciousness.

The infection first manifests with a nonspecific prodrome of fatigue, weakness, malaise, and low-grade fever. In some instances, the patient may recall being bitten by an animal (e.g., a bat, raccoon, or coyote) and report paresthesias or anesthesia at the site of the bite (a finding pathognomonic for rabies). CNS invasion can cause acute agitation, hyperactivity, and hydrophobia, or relative somnolence and paralysis.

If the artery is ligated during surgery, it may be damaged.","answers":[{"option":"Voice pitch limitation","explanation":"\nVoice pitch limitation is caused by damage to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN), which occurs in up to 30% of thyroid dissections. The external branch of the SLN innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for lengthening, thinning, and stiffening the vocal cords and increases the pitch of phonation.

Degeneration of the spinocerebellar tract can result in cerebellar signs such as ataxia, nystagmus, and dysarthria. Degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tract causes spasticity, which can result in deformities such as hammer toe, pes cavus, and kyphoscoliosis. Despite the presence of spasticity, patients often have decreased deep tendon reflexes due to the damage to dorsal root ganglia and the dorsal column. Dorsal column damage also causes impaired proprioception (which contributes to ataxia) as well as impaired vibration sense.

Although this infant has evidence of brachial plexus injury (i.e., ptosis, miosis, decreased arm movement), he has no respiratory issues and normal vital signs, making phrenic nerve palsy unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Unilateral wrist drop","explanation":"A unilateral wrist drop can occur after injury to the radial nerve (e.g., mid-shaft fracture of the humerus) or injury to the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (e.g., penetrating trauma below the clavicle). However, neither radial nerve injury nor posterior cord injury would manifest with ptosis and miosis, which suggests that this patient has a different brachial plexus injury.","bool":false},{"option":"Crepitus in the upper chest","explanation":"\nCrepitus in the upper chest suggests a clavicular fracture for which this infant is at increased risk because of his traumatic birthing process. Although a clavicular fracture is usually asymptomatic, it can manifest as pseudoparalysis with reduced movement of the arm (due to pain), as seen in this infant. However, the presence of ptosis and miosis suggests a brachial plexus injury and not pseudoparalysis.","bool":false},{"option":"Absent nasolabial fold","explanation":"An absent nasolabial fold suggests a cranial nerve (CN) VII injury, which most commonly results from a forceps-assisted delivery. Although this patient has other facial abnormalities (ptosis and miosis), these findings are due to sympathetic nerve injury originating from the brachial plexus. CN VII fibers do not run within the brachial plexus, and thus facial droop is not associated with this condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Lower back mass","explanation":"\nSpina bifida cystica can manifest with a lower back mass due to protrusion of the meninges (i.e., meningocele) and spinal cord (i.e., myelomeningocele). Although these patients will have symptoms of spinal cord dysfunction, spina bifida cystica of the lower cord would cause lower extremity weakness, not unilateral arm deficits and facial sympathetic nerve dysfunction, as seen in this infant.","bool":false}]},{"id":345,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has not had her period for 4 months. Menses had previously occurred at regular 28-day intervals with moderate flow. A home pregnancy test was negative. She also reports recurrent headaches and has noticed that when she goes to the movies she cannot see the outer edges of the screen without turning her head to each side. This patient's symptoms are most likely caused by abnormal growth of which of the following?","difficulty":2,"hint":"A cranial contrast MRI would reveal an intrasellar mass.","answers":[{"option":"Adenohypophysis","explanation":"Abnormal growth of the adenohypophysis is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms, which are consistent with a pituitary adenoma. Adenomas of the pituitary gland are most commonly due to aberrant proliferation of lactotroph cells in the adenohypophysis. The resulting hyperprolactinemia eventually causes suppression of gonadotropins and subsequent secondary amenorrhea. Bitemporal hemianopsia (due to compression of the optic chiasm) and headaches may develop as the adenoma grows.\nHer symptoms could also be explained by a large nonsecreting pituitary adenoma compressing the optic chiasm (bitemporal hemianopsia) and the pituitary stalk or the gonadotropic cells (secondary amenorrhea), but the absence of other symptoms of hypopituitarism makes prolactinoma more likely.","bool":true},{"option":"Pineal gland","explanation":"Abnormal growth of the pineal gland leads to the development of a pinealoma, which generally manifests during childhood. Symptoms of pinealomas include visual disturbances and dizziness or recurrent headaches (due to hydrocephalus). However, pinealomas are associated with vertical gaze palsy rather than the bitemporal hemianopsia observed in this patient. Moreover, menstrual disturbances would not be expected, as pinealomas are hormonally inactive.","bool":false},{"option":"Ependymal cells","explanation":"Abnormal growth of ependymal cells is the underlying pathology of ependymomas, most of which arise close to the fourth ventricle. Ependymomas commonly cause obstructive hydrocephalus, which may manifest as recurrent headaches. However, ependymomas typically develop during childhood and are not associated with menstrual irregularities or visual disturbances.","bool":false},{"option":"Schwann cells","explanation":"Abnormal growth of Schwann cells leads to the development of a schwannoma, which typically arises near the cerebellopontine angle. Large tumors may lead to symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, e.g., recurrent headache. However, in the case of a schwannoma, other features would likely be present, including tinnitus, vertigo, and hearing loss. Moreover, menstrual irregularities or bitemporal hemianopia would not be expected in the case of a Schwannoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Arachnoid cap cells","explanation":"Abnormal growth of arachnoid cap cells is the underlying pathology of meningiomas. Even though this patient's recurrent headaches could be attributed to a meningioma, this tumor would not explain this patient's secondary amenorrhea or her visual disturbances.","bool":false},{"option":"Astrocytes","explanation":"Abnormal growth of astrocytes is the underlying pathology of astrocytomas. While low-grade astrocytomas commonly manifest during childhood with a benign course, high-grade astrocytomas (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) occurs in older individuals and manifests in rapidly progressive symptoms that depend upon the location of the lesion but may include headaches. This patient's prolonged course of symptoms and secondary amenorrhea is not suggestive of glioblastoma multiforme.","bool":false}]},{"id":346,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"\nAn 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of repeated episodes of daydreaming over the past 2 months. The mother reports that during these episodes, the boy abruptly stops what he is doing and just stares into space. She says that he sometimes also smacks his lips. The episodes typically last 1–2 minutes and occur 2–3 times per week. Initially, the boy only experienced the symptoms at school but last week he had an episode while playing baseball with his father. When his father tried to talk to him, he did not seem to listen. After the episode, he was confused for 10 minutes and too tired to play. The patient has been healthy except for an episode of otitis media 1 year ago that was treated with amoxicillin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no other abnormalities. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?\n\n","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient presents with episodes of altered mental status that are associated with alimentary automatisms (lip smacking), occur several times a week during rest as well as during physical activity, and are followed by a postictal phase (confusion, tiredness). These episodes are most consistent with a diagnosis of focal seizures with impaired consciousness.","answers":[{"option":"Temporal lobe spikes on ictal EEG","explanation":"This child presents with a history of focal seizures with impaired awareness, which is a primary feature of temporal lobe epilepsy. Focal seizures originate in the temporal lobe and are caused by structural changes or damage to the brain (e.g., encephalitis, developmental disorders). Seizure activity is visible as temporal lobe spikes on EEG during a seizure episode; interictal EEG may be normal. This patient should undergo an MRI to determine potential underlying causes. Treatment consists of pharmacotherapy with lamotrigine or levetiracetam; surgery may be necessary for refractory disease. The prognosis is unfavorable, as only 40% of patients remain asymptomatic on pharmacotherapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Slow spike-wave complexes on ictal EEG","explanation":"Generalized 3 Hz spike-and-slow-wave complexes on EEG are seen in children with childhood absence epilepsy. While absence seizures manifest with brief unresponsiveness and automatisms like lip-smacking, the episodes are typically shorter (5–10 seconds). Atypical absence seizures may last &gt; 30 seconds, have a more gradual onset, and patients may be more responsive. However, like typical absence seizures, the episodes would occur several times a day and are not followed by a postictal phase.","bool":false},{"option":"Impairment in communication and social interaction","explanation":"Impairment in communication and social interaction is a core feature of autism spectrum disorder. While children with autism often prefer to be on their own and may ignore unwanted attempts at communication by other people, the episodes described in this case are indicative of impaired awareness. Since no other features of autism spectrum disorder are present (e.g., stereotyped behavior patterns, restricted interests), this diagnosis is unlikely. Autism spectrum disorder is associated with an increased occurrence of epilepsy and should be considered as a factor that potentially contributes to abnormal behavior in children.","bool":false},{"option":"Normal neurodevelopment","explanation":"While episodes of daydreaming may occur as part of normal development in children, daydreaming without pathological significance is often triggered by boredom, does not occur during physical activity, can be interrupted, and is not associated with retrograde amnesia or automatisms (e.g., lip-smacking). This boy's symptoms are consistent with focal seizures with impaired consciousness, which are often caused by structural or metabolic pathologies (e.g., hippocampal sclerosis, developmental and neurodegenerative disorders, CNS infections, head trauma). These conditions are also likely to manifest with impaired neurodevelopment. Furthermore, individuals with this patient's focal seizure disorder seldom remain asymptomatic despite medical treatment.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Difficulty sustaining attention during tasks","explanation":"Difficulty sustaining attention is a diagnostic feature of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A child may repeatedly interrupt an activity, appear to be daydreaming, and not pay attention to instructions or when being spoken to directly. However, since consciousness is not impaired, the child's attention can easily be regained. The absence of hyperactivity and impulsivity in this boy further rule out ADHD.","bool":false},{"option":"Defiant behavior towards figures of authority","explanation":"Defiant behavior towards figures of authority is a diagnostic criterion of oppositional defiant disorder. Since this boy has no history of openly defying his parents or being irritable, this diagnosis can be ruled out. His unresponsiveness towards his father can be attributed to a postictal state rather than deliberately ignoring being spoken to.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Conductive hearing loss on audiometry","explanation":"Although a child with conductive hearing loss (e.g., as a complication of otitis media) may appear to be inattentive or unresponsive when spoken to, symptoms of impaired hearing would be consistently present. While this boy has brief episodes in which he appears inattentive, he generally responds normally when spoken to and shows no abnormalities on physical exam.

Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally. This patient's condition is most likely to result in which of the following?","difficulty":5,"hint":"Isoniazid is a commonly used monotherapy for latent tuberculosis. Adverse effects of isoniazid include peripheral polyneuropathy due to pyridoxine deficiency.","answers":[{"option":"Impaired synthesis of neurotransmitters","explanation":"\nPyridoxine deficiency causes impaired synthesis of neurotransmitters, as pyridoxine is an important cofactor for multiple enzymes, including those that take part in the synthesis of GABA, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Decreased levels of GABA can cause hyperirritability and seizures. In addition, vitamin B6 is an important cofactor of the enzyme cystathionine synthase, which is needed for the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine. When this enzyme is impaired, (e.g., during isoniazid treatment), homocysteine is increasingly metabolized to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) via methionine synthase. SAM inhibits the synthesis of sphingolipids and myelin, which can lead to irreversible nerve damage.\nDietary vitamin B6 deficiency is rare, but can occur in patients with certain risk factors such as advanced age, as seen here, as well as obesity, pregnancy, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and malabsorptive states. Pyridoxine deficiency is more commonly associated with medication interactions that impair vitamin B6 metabolism, such as isoniazid, penicillamine, and hydralazine.","bool":true},{"option":"Impaired breakdown of glucose to ATP","explanation":"Deficiency of ATP due to an impaired breakdown of glucose is the mechanism of neuropathy in patients with thiamine deficiency (dry beriberi), because thiamine is an essential cofactor for the enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Isoniazid causes a deficiency of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), not thiamine (vitamin B1).","bool":false},{"option":"Intracellular accumulation of sorbitol","explanation":"\nIntracellular accumulation of sorbitol is the mechanism of action of diabetic neuropathy, which can result in paresthesias, loss of sensation in a stocking pattern, and an unsteady gait due to impaired proprioception (sensory ataxia). However, isoniazid is not associated with sorbitol accumulation.","bool":false},{"option":"Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons","explanation":"\nSegmental demyelination of peripheral axons is seen in certain peripheral neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and type 1 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. These peripheral neuropathies can also result in paresthesias, loss of light touch sensation, and an unsteady gait due to impaired proprioception (sensory ataxia). However, the peripheral neuropathy caused by pyridoxine deficiency is the result of a degenerative axonal neuropathy and not a demyelinating neuropathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Degeneration of the dorsal columns","explanation":"Degeneration of the dorsal column is seen in subacute combined degeneration (SCD), which is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency and can manifest with decreased light touch sensation as well as an unsteady gait due to impaired proprioception (sensory ataxia). Peripheral neuropathy due to vitamin B12 deficiency could also explain the paresthesias in this patient. However, while long-term use of metformin can cause vitamin B12 deficiency, isoniazid is not known to cause it.","bool":false}]},{"id":348,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife for the evaluation of a suspected stroke.

This patient most likely presented with which of the following findings on physical examination?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This arrow points at the posterior limb of the left internal capsule.","answers":[{"option":"Weakness of the right leg","explanation":"Weakness of the right leg is the most likely physical finding of a lacunar infarction of the posterior limb of the left internal capsule, which is located between the lentiform nucleus (basal ganglia) and thalamus and contains the anterior corticospinal tract, lateral corticospinal tract, and thalamocortical tract. Pure motor hemiparesis, the most common type of lacunar stroke, is caused by an isolated infarction of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Affected individuals present with contralateral hemiparesis (due to corticospinal tract damage) in the absence of cortical signs (e.g., aphasia, visual field abnormalities). Chronic hypertension, as seen in this patient, is a risk factor for microatheroma formation and lipohyalinosis in the poorly-collateralized small penetrating arteries of the brain (e.g., lenticulostriate arteries), which can result in lacunar stroke.\nOther parts of the internal capsule include the anterior limb, which contains the thalamocortical tract, and the genu, which contains the corticobulbar tract.","bool":true},{"option":"Loss of sensation of the left arm","explanation":"An infarct involving the posterior limb of the internal capsule may manifest with a loss of arm sensation as a result of damage to the thalamocortical tract (which conveys somatosensory information from the contralateral body to the cortex). However, an infarct in the left internal capsule, as depicted in the photograph, would cause loss of sensation of the right arm rather than the left.","bool":false},{"option":"Paralysis of the left face","explanation":"An infarct of the internal capsule can manifest with hemifacial paralysis as a result of damage to the corticobulbar tracts that supply the facial motor nuclei. However, a left-sided internal capsule infarct, as described here, would cause paralysis of the right rather than left lower facial muscles because the lower division of the facial nucleus receives upper motor neuron innervation from the contralateral corticobulbar tract. Moreover, corticobulbar tracts travel within the genu (flexure) of the internal capsule, whereas the arrow is pointing at the posterior limb of the internal capsule.","bool":false},{"option":"Hemianopia of the right visual field","explanation":"\nHemianopia of the right visual field (i.e., right homonymous hemianopia) is most commonly caused by a post-chiasmal cortical lesion within the contralateral optic tract, optic radiation, or visual cortex (in the occipital lobe). Parts of the optic radiations and occipital lobes are seen on this transverse brain slice, but these structures are located in the posterior region of the slice. The arrow in the image points to a different structure.","bool":false},{"option":"Hemiballismus of the left side","explanation":"\nHemiballismus is most commonly caused by a lacunar stroke involving the contralateral subthalamic nucleus. The subthalamic nuclei are a pair of grey matter structures located caudal to the thalamus, cranial to the substantia nigra (part of the midbrain), and medial to the internal capsule. The transverse section shown here is taken at the level of the thalamus; the subthalamic nuclei are not visible in this section.","bool":false},{"option":"Hemineglect of the right side","explanation":"\nHemineglect is most commonly caused by a lesion affecting the nondominant parietal cortex (which is typically the right parietal cortex in right-handed individuals).

Abdominal ultrasound shows a large anechoic mass in the pelvis. Which of the following drugs most likely accounts for this patient's current symptoms?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Severe lower abdominal pain, anuria, and a palpable anechoic lower abdominal mass suggest acute urinary retention (AUR).

Management typically depends on symptom onset. Acute onset of symptoms following facial trauma is usually caused by nerve injury (e.g., transection); therefore, surgery (e.g., nerve repair) may be indicated. A delayed presentation (e.g., one day after trauma) is most likely secondary to edema within the facial nerve canal. In this patient, corticosteroid therapy is indicated to control swelling within the facial nerve canal.

BPPV results from dislodged or abnormally adherent otoliths, leading to semicircular canal dysfunction. During the test, a set of specific sequential head positioning maneuvers are used to provoke symptoms. The presence of positional vertigo and nystagmus during the maneuvers indicates a positive test and confirms the diagnosis. Although BPPV resolves spontaneously in about half of all patients, canalith repositioning maneuvers (e.g., Epley maneuver) can also be performed in order to mobilize the otoliths out of the involved semicircular canals.","bool":true},{"option":"Audiometry","explanation":"Audiometry is a useful diagnostic tool for patients with Meniere disease or acoustic neuroma, both of which can manifest with horizontal nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting. However, symptomatic episodes of Meniere disease usually last from minutes to hours and are not triggered by positioning while symptoms of acoustic neuroma typically have an insidious onset and a chronic course; this patient's brief and recurrent episodes of vertigo suggest a different diagnosis.

It is an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotic medications, especially high-potency typical antipsychotics (e.g., fluphenazine). The onset of akathisia is typically within 1–8 weeks of treatment initiation, as seen here. If feasible, this patient should have his fluphenazine dosage reduced or he should be switched to an antipsychotic drug with a lower risk of EPS. For persistent akathisia, the first-line pharmacotherapy is a beta blocker (e.g., propranolol). Benzodiazepine or benztropine therapy can be considered for akathisia refractory to beta blocker therapy.\nOther important forms of EPS are pseudoparkinsonism, acute dystonic reactions, and tardive dyskinesia. Pseudoparkinsonism occurs within the same timeframe as akathisia but is characterized by tremors, cogwheel rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Acute dystonic reactions occur more immediately (within hours to days), and tardive dyskinesia occurs later (months to years).\nSee “Overview of extrapyramidal symptoms” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Drug-induced mania","explanation":"Drug-induced mania can be caused by medications such as stimulants and corticosteroids, and antidepressant medications can induce hypomania or mania in patients with bipolar disorder.

Multiple ring-enhancing lesions seen on MRI, neurologic symptoms (e.g., headache, seizures), and eosinophils in cerebrospinal fluid should raise concern for neurocysticercosis.","answers":[{"option":"Eggs from dog feces","explanation":"The ingestion of eggs from dog feces can result in the transmission of toxocariasis (from Toxocara canis) and echinococcosis. These conditions are typically asymptomatic. In rare cases, central nervous system involvement in toxocariasis can cause ring-enhancing lesions on MRI and neurologic symptoms (e.g., headache, seizures). When symptomatic, echinococcosis usually involves the liver and/or lungs and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting) and pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, chest pain, dyspnea). Neither of these conditions causes myalgia or subretinal cysts.","bool":false},{"option":"Larva from raw pork","explanation":"This is tricky. When you chose this answer option, you likely considered how Taenia solium is transmitted since it is indeed the pathogen responsible for both cysticercosis and intestinal taeniasis. While both conditions are caused by the same pathogen, the life cycle stage (e.g., eggs, larvae, cysts) the pathogen is in when ingested determines which condition develops. Ingestion of larva from raw or undercooked pork most commonly results in the development of intestinal taeniasis. Infected pork meat contains cysticerci, which has an invaginated scolex. Once ingested, the scolex evaginates and attaches to the intestine walls using its hooks and suckers. The attached scolex produces proglottids and an adult tapeworm begins to develop. In contrast to intestinal taeniasis, cysticercosis develops after the ingestion of T. solium eggs, not larvae.","bool":false},{"option":"Eggs from human feces","explanation":"\nCysticercosis, which is transmitted through the ingestion of Taenia solium eggs excreted in human feces, is endemic to several regions of the world, including Central and South America. The eggs hatch in the intestines, invade the intestinal wall, and disseminate hematogenously to different tissues, where they develop into larval cysts (cysticerci). Accumulation of cysticerci in muscle tissue results in myalgia. Ocular cysticercosis can manifest with subretinal cysts on ophthalmologic examination. Accumulation in the central nervous system and the resulting immune response can cause headache, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures. Cysticercosis is treated with praziquantel, albendazole (especially if there is central nervous system involvement), and corticosteroid therapy.\nPatients with intestinal taeniasis can develop cysticercosis through autoinoculation (e.g., shedding of T. solium eggs in feces with subsequent fecal-oral transmission).","bool":true},{"option":"Eggs from cat feces","explanation":"The ingestion of eggs from cat feces can result in the transmission of toxocariasis (from Toxocara cati) and toxoplasmosis. These conditions are typically asymptomatic but can result in ring-enhancing lesions on MRI and neurologic symptoms (e.g., headache, seizures) in rare cases. However, neither of these conditions causes myalgia or subretinal cysts. Moreover, central nervous system involvement of toxoplasmosis is usually only seen in patients who are immunocompromised; this patient has no history of immune deficiency.","bool":false},{"option":"Undercooked fish","explanation":"The ingestion of undercooked fish can result in the transmission of diphyllobothriasis. This condition is typically asymptomatic but can cause nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, diarrhea, and dizziness. Because Diphyllobothrium latum competes for vitamin B12 absorption in the small intestine, chronic infection can result in vitamin B12 deficiency and subsequent megaloblastic anemia. Although severe vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurologic manifestations such as peripheral nerve degeneration, it does not cause headache, blurry vision, or seizures.

Whereas patients with CN III palsy due to compression usually show dilated pupils, those with diabetic mononeuropathy normally do not have pupillary involvement because the microangiopathy typically involves the vasa nervorum within the oculomotor nerve, while the pial blood vessels (which supply the superficial parasympathetic fibers) are usually spared.\nCN III palsy due to diabetic or hypertensive microangiopathy usually improves with blood pressure and glycemic control.

In PD, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to a deficiency of dopamine in the striatum. Dopamine deficiency in the striatum in turn causes decreased excitatory signaling to the motor cortex, which results in bradykinesia and akinesia. Other common features of PD include shuffling gait, postural instability, and micrographia.\nThe diagnosis of PD is clinical; additional tests, including imaging, are not routinely required but should be considered in patients with atypical presentation or to rule out other disorders. To establish the diagnosis of PD, patients must present with bradykinesia in addition to tremor or rigidity.","bool":true},{"option":"Startle myoclonus","explanation":"Startle myoclonus is a classic sign of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare condition that manifests with neuropsychiatric changes and akinetic mutism.

Most patients with HD initially present with typical features such as chorea and abnormal eye movements, with a symptom onset usually between 20 and 50 years of age. Moreover, HD does not explain this patient's tremor.","bool":false},{"option":"No abnormalities","explanation":"All of this patient's symptoms, in isolation, may represent normal findings. Two falls in a person &gt; 65 years of age may be attributed to tripping, a resting tremor may represent exaggerated physiologic tremor or essential tremor, and thrashing in sleep may be caused by isolated REM dysfunction.

Increased levels of RBCs (&gt; 10 RBC/mm3) may also be found in the CSF due to microhemorrhages in the temporal lobe. Bilateral temporal lobe involvement on an MRI of the brain is pathognomonic of HSV encephalitis. Based on this patient's history, epidemiological considerations, CSF findings, and MRI results, HSV encephalitis is the most likely diagnosis. CSF PCR for HSV-1 and HSV-2 is the gold standard diagnostic test and should be performed in this patient.

Other common findings include fever, headache, myalgia, and, in rare cases, encephalitis. Infected patients often have a history of tick bites and travel to an endemic region in spring or summer. Despite risk factors for infection with R. rickettsii (camping), the classic rash of RMSF is not visible on examination and the MRI findings point to a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Neisseria meningitidis","explanation":"\nNeisseria meningitidis causes rapidly progressive meningitis, especially in children and young adults. Meningococcal meningitis classically presents with intense headache, high fever, neck stiffness, vomiting, photophobia, and sometimes encephalitis. Disease progression can cause large petechial hemorrhages (especially on the neck), adrenal hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome), and coma. While there are some similarities in this patient's presentation, her focal neurologic deficits, MRI findings, and lack of meningism make meningococcal infection unlikely. Moreover, this patient is likely immunized against meningococcus.","bool":false},{"option":"Enterovirus","explanation":"\nEnteroviruses are a common cause of viral meningitis, though they are an uncommon cause of encephalitis. In cases of enterovirus infection of the central nervous system, leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI is the most typical finding; asymmetrical, bitemporal hyperintensities are not characteristic. In fact, this MRI finding is very strongly associated with a different etiology.","bool":false},{"option":"Rabies virus","explanation":"Infection with the rabies virus causes rabies. The infection first manifests with a nonspecific prodrome of fatigue, weakness, malaise, and low-grade fever. In some instances, the patient may recall being bitten by an animal (e.g., a bat, raccoon, or coyote) and report paresthesias or anesthesia at the site of the bite (a finding pathognomonic for rabies). CNS invasion can cause acute agitation, hyperactivity, and hydrophobia, or relative somnolence and paralysis. CNS invasion is untreatable, and coma and death are almost always inevitable at that point. Rabies is extremely rare in the United States. Moreover, although this patient spent time in caves (spelunking), she has no history of being bitten by an animal, making rabies extremely unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"West Nile virus","explanation":"\nWest Nile virus infection is usually asymptomatic, but can cause a nonspecific flu-like syndrome involving mild fever, fatigue, and myalgia.

She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she got lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas oven on after cooking a meal. She becomes agitated when asked questions directly but is unconcerned when her son reports her history and says he is overprotective of her. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, enalapril, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. She is alert and oriented to place and person but not to time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present.

Finally, these hereditary conditions almost exclusively manifest in childhood or early adulthood.","bool":false},{"option":"Invasion","explanation":"Invasion of a lung carcinoma into the cervical sympathetic chain can lead to Pancoast syndrome, presenting with upper extremity weakness and loss of deep tendon reflexes, as seen in this patient. However, muscle weakness in Pancoast syndrome is typically unilateral. In addition, further symptoms caused by the compression or infiltration of local structures by the tumor would be expected (e.g., shoulder pain, muscle atrophy, sensory deficits, Horner syndrome, hoarseness, and superior vena cava syndrome). An increase in reflex activity noted after repeated stimulation is inconsistent with this diagnosis. Moreover, the patient's CT revealed a mass in the center of the right lung, whereas Pancoast tumors are always located in the superior sulcus.","bool":false}]},{"id":368,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 2-day-old male newborn is brought to the physician because he became somnolent and felt cold after breastfeeding. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. He was born at 40 weeks' gestation and weighed 3538 g (7 lb 13 oz); he currently weighs 3311 g (7 lb 5 oz). Examination shows generalized hypotonia. Serum studies show an ammonia concentration of 150 μmol/L (N &lt; 50). Fasting serum glucose concentration is normal. Accumulation of which of the following substances is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's neurological symptoms?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This neonate's hyperammonemia after feeding is most likely due to a urea cycle disorder. Ammonia is metabolized through the actions of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase.","answers":[{"option":"Glutamine","explanation":"\nHyperammonemia results in the accumulation of glutamine, which plays an important role in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Upon activation, neurons in the brain release neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate, GABA) that are normally taken up from the synaptic cleft and recycled by astrocytes. In states of hyperammonemia, excess ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters into astrocytes. The astrocytes detoxify excess ammonia through the actions of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase. The consequent production of excess glutamine creates an osmotic effect that draws water into astrocytes and causes cellular swelling and dysfunction, resulting in cerebral edema that manifests with neurological symptoms such as those seen here.\nWhile the accumulation of glutamine is one component of the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, the process is multifactorial and remains an area of ongoing study. In addition to the osmotic damage to astrocytes induced by the accumulation of glutamine, the metabolism of other neurotransmitters, including glutamate and GABA, is also disturbed in states of hyperammonemia. It is thought that these changes in metabolism lead to inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission and activation of inhibitory neurotransmission.","bool":true},{"option":"α-Ketoglutarate","explanation":"Under physiological conditions, α-ketoglutarate and ammonia act in equilibrium with glutamate in the central nervous system. When there is excess ammonia, however, this equilibrium shifts toward glutamate, reducing levels of α-ketoglutarate. Thus, hyperammonemia causes depletion rather than accumulation of α-ketoglutarate. Because α-ketoglutarate is also an important substrate of the citric acid cycle, its depletion can cause impairment of cerebral energy metabolism and subsequent neurologic dysfunction.","bool":false},{"option":"Urea","explanation":"Increased urea concentration is seen in uremic encephalopathy, which can manifest with somnolence and muscle weakness (e.g., hypotonia). However, uremic encephalopathy is caused by advanced renal failure, which would not explain this patient's elevated blood ammonia level. This patient most likely has a urea cycle disorder, which would cause an impaired ability to convert amino acids to urea, not an elevation in urea levels.","bool":false},{"option":"Acylcarnitine","explanation":"Acylcarnitines accumulate in CPT II deficiency, a disorder caused by impaired long-chain fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria. Possible manifestations include somnolence, hypotonia, and hyperammonemia, all of which are seen here. However, in CPT II deficiency, fatty acids are not able to be used as substrates for gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoketotic fasting hypoglycemia. Conversely, this patient's serum glucose concentration is normal.","bool":false},{"option":"Succinyl-CoA","explanation":"Accumulation of succinyl-CoA, an intermediate of the citric acid cycle synthesized from α-ketoglutarate, is not associated with any disorder presenting with hyperammonemia. In rare cases, neonatal hyperammonemia is due to methylmalonic acidemia, which is caused by impaired metabolism of methylmalonic acid and characteristically leads to decreased rather than increased succinyl-CoA concentrations.","bool":false}]},{"id":369,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 24-year-old man comes to the physician because of back pain after being severely sunburned on his upper back 3 days ago.

Sensitization of which of the following structures would best explain this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient's symptoms are consistent with allodynia.","answers":[{"option":"Nociceptors of dorsal root","explanation":"The nociceptors of the dorsal root are involved in the pathophysiology of dysfunctional perceptions of pain, such as allodynia. Although incompletely understood, allodynia is thought to result from both peripheral and central sensitization. After an injury (e.g., sunburn), cytokines, nerve growth factors, and other chemical mediators are released in the injured area, leading to a constant, increased input to the nociceptors. This causes an up-regulation of the ion channels in the nociceptors, making them more sensitive to chemical mediators and lowering the threshold to stimulus, consequently causing more action potentials to form. This phenomenon is known as peripheral sensitization. The constant increased peripheral output is likely a significant driver to the sensitization of central nociceptive neurons, which likely contributes to the persistence of allodynia long after the initial injury (e.g., in postherpetic neuralgia).","bool":true},{"option":"Glycinergic receptors of thalamic neurons","explanation":"Glycinergic receptors on thalamic neurons play a role in the modulation of a painful stimulus. However, glycinergic receptors are inhibitory receptors and their sensitization would not contribute to allodynia.","bool":false},{"option":"Glutaminergic receptors of ventral horn neurons","explanation":"The ventral horn contains the bodies of the lower motor neurons, for which the glutaminergic receptors provide excitatory stimulus. Because these neurons are involved with movement, not sensation, they do not contribute to allodynia.","bool":false},{"option":"Ruffini corpuscles of sensory neurons","explanation":"\nRuffini corpuscles are slow-adapting mechanoreceptors that are sensitive to mechanical pressure, skin stretching, and joint-angle changes. These receptors are not involved in the modulation of painful stimuli and would therefore not contribute to allodynia. Moreover, Ruffini corpuscles are located in the fingertips and joints rather than the upper back.","bool":false},{"option":"Opioid synapses of interneurons","explanation":"Interneurons located in the dorsal horn release endogenous opioids at their synapses to modulate painful stimuli.

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, prompt treatment with agents to lower intraocular pressure (e.g., beta blockers, α2 agonists, and/or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) is necessary to prevent permanent vision loss, with definitive surgical treatment (e.g., peripheral iridotomy) indicated after the acute attack is controlled.\nIncreased age, female sex, and the intake of certain drugs (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) are all risk factors for acute angle-closure glaucoma.","bool":true},{"option":"Administer topical atropine","explanation":"Topical atropine is often administered for anterior uveitis to help prevent scarring and relieve pain. While anterior uveitis usually presents with eye pain, redness, and photophobia, it would not present with corneal edema or a fixed dilated pupil (unless the patient has had multiple previous bouts of uveitis causing iris scarring). These features suggest angle-closure glaucoma, in which mydriasis (i.e., relaxation of the iris) worsens the blockage of the trabecular meshwork and further reduces the drainage of aqueous humor from the eye. Therefore, the administration of atropine or other mydriatic drugs, as well as covering the eye (darkness induces mydriasis), can worsen the condition and must be avoided.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform retinal photocoagulation","explanation":"\nRetinal photocoagulation is commonly used for diabetic retinopathy or central retinal vein occlusion, as ischemic areas of the retina are coagulated to prevent the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and subsequent neovascularization of healthy retinal tissue.

One week ago, he was entirely unable to move for about a minute when he wanted to exit an elevator. The physician prescribes a drug that increases the bioavailability of levodopa by preferentially preventing its peripheral methylation. This patient was most likely prescribed which of the following drugs by the physician?","difficulty":4,"hint":"The patient is experiencing typical symptoms of long-term treatment with levodopa including a wearing-off effect and increasing motor fluctuations (known as on-off phenomenon and freezing). The drug prescribed by the physician inhibits the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase, which may reduce these symptoms by keeping the bioavailability of levodopa more stable.","answers":[{"option":"Entacapone","explanation":"\nEntacapone is a peripherally acting COMT inhibitor that reduces the methylation of levodopa and dopamine, thus allowing a more stable and long-lasting plasma concentration of the drug. This results in fewer periods of end-of-dose akinesia and less variability of symptoms during the day. Tolcapone is a centrally acting COMT inhibitor that is used for refractory Parkinson disease.\nMotor fluctuations increase during long-term therapy with levodopa because the neurons gradually lose their capacity to store and release dopamine. The severity of symptoms is directly related to the drug dose.","bool":true},{"option":"Carbidopa","explanation":"\nCarbidopa is a decarboxylase inhibitor that is often given as a combined levodopa/carbidopa formulation. Although carbidopa increases the bioavailability of levodopa like the drug prescribed by the physician, it acts by decreasing the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine. Additionally, this reduces the peripheral side effects of levodopa (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, nausea, and vomiting). Carbidopa cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, so it does not negatively affect dopamine production in the brain. Since levodopa/carbidopa is typically the first-line treatment of Parkinson disease in patients &gt; 65 years of age, this patient is likely already receiving this medication.","bool":false},{"option":"Rasagiline","explanation":"\nRasagiline, as well as selegiline, are selective MAO-B inhibitors that decrease dopamine degradation in the brain, thus prolonging the effect of dopamine. Rasagiline also appears to have a neuroprotective effect by preventing the free radical damage caused by oxidative metabolism of dopamine. MAO-B inhibitors do not increase the bioavailability of levodopa but can be used as monotherapy in patients with Parkinson under the age of 65 with no significant comorbidities.","bool":false},{"option":"Ropinirole","explanation":"\nRopinirole is a non-ergot dopamine agonist that acts directly at the striatal dopamine receptors.

Lowering ACh levels proportionately to dopamine levels improves Parkinson symptoms by reestablishing the balance of ACh sensitivity in the basal ganglia. Trihexyphenidyl does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa but is used as monotherapy in patients under the age of 65 with tremor as the main complaint.","bool":false},{"option":"Amantadine","explanation":"\nAmantadine is an NMDA antagonist whose mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. However, it is known to increase the bioavailability of dopamine, not levodopa, by increasing its release and decreasing its reuptake in central presynaptic terminals.

In surgeries that require the patient to be in a prone position (e.g., spinal surgery), improper positioning of the arms can compress and injure this nerve. This injury leads to paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle, which manifests with medial winging of the scapula and weakened abduction of the shoulder above 90° (manifesting, e.g., during hair combing), as seen here. Further common causes of long thoracic nerve injury include invasive procedures (e.g., axillary lymph node dissection), direct trauma to the shoulder, and prolonged nerve compression (e.g., carrying a heavy backpack).\nThe musculocutaneous nerve also receives nerve fibers from C5–C7 spinal roots, but it arises as a branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus rather than directly from the spinal roots. Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve (e.g., a gunshot wound in the arm) manifests with loss of sensation over the lateral forearm and impaired flexion and supination of the forearm.","bool":true},{"option":"C3-C5","explanation":"The phrenic nerve arises from the C3–C5 spinal roots and innervates the diaphragm and pericardium.

In surgeries that require the patient to be in a prone position (e.g., spinal surgery), improper positioning of the arms can injure the lower trunk (due to arm hyperabduction) or the ulnar nerve (due to pressure on the cubital tunnel). However, lower brachial plexus palsy (Klumpke palsy) would manifest with weakness of all the intrinsic muscles of the hand and sensory deficits on the medial side of the corresponding upper limb.

Patients develop a symmetric cape-like distribution of pain and temperature sensory loss around the upper trunk, shoulders and upper limbs. Vibration and position sense are selectively spared because fibers of the posterior columns decussate higher up in the medulla. As syringomyelia progresses, lower motor neuron weakness develops symmetrically in the upper limbs (evident by areflexia and fasciculations in this patient) because the fluid-filled cavity begins to compress the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord at the level of the lesion. Syringomyelia is commonly associated with Chiari type I malformation.\nAs the lesion expands, the patient will develop an upper motor neuron palsy of the lower extremities and lower half of the trunk (due to involvement of the corticospinal tracts), as well as complete sensory loss below the level of the lesion (including loss of vibration and position sense).

However, neurological symptoms produced by disc prolapse are usually unilateral and localized to the distribution of the compressed nerve root. It is very unlikely that nerve root compression is the cause of this patient's symmetrical distribution of deficits; many nerve roots would have to be compressed simultaneously on both sides.

Abduction of the thumb followed by slow relaxation upon percussion indicates myotonia. Myotonia in a 10-year-old boy with muscle aches and weakness in the distal muscles (hand and/or foot), face, and extraocular muscles is highly suggestive of type 1 myotonic dystrophy. Reduced fetal temporalis and pterygoid muscle growth result in a high-arched palate. About 50% of patients with myotonic dystrophy have some degree of cognitive impairment, which likely explains his poor school performance.

The auriculotemporal nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular nerve, carries the parasympathetic fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve to the parotid gland but neither the trigeminal nerve nor the mandibular nerve carries any parasympathetic fibers. Therefore, an isolated auriculotemporal nerve lesion would decrease parotid gland secretion but it would not affect the muscles of mastication.

This patient's tumor is in the fourth ventricle, which is the most common location for ependymoma in children and the last ventricle along the CSF pathway; as such, all ventricles become dilated with trapped CSF. Ependymomas typically appear as homogeneous enhancing masses on CT neuroimaging, often with cysts and calcifications. Ependymomas have a poor prognosis, especially when located in the posterior fossa. The next step in management for this patient would be a brain MRI to provide better images of the tumor. Treatment would likely involve surgical resection and possibly radiation therapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Cerebrospinal fluid overproduction","explanation":"\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) overproduction is a rare cause of hydrocephalus and only occurs due to choroid plexus tumors.

This condition is typically a result of bilateral damage to the ventral pons.","answers":[{"option":"Basilar","explanation":"The basilar artery is located on the ventral surface of the pons and contributes to the posterior cerebral circulation. A ruptured basilar artery aneurysm can cause locked-in syndrome by causing bilateral damage to the midbrain, which contains cranial nerve III (CN III) and CN IV nuclei, pons (containing CN V, VI, VII, and VIII nuclei), medulla (containing CN IX, X, XI, and XII nuclei), and corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts. Peripheral motor symptoms (e.g., quadriplegia, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, and positive Babinski signs in both legs) are caused by bilateral interruption of the corticospinal tracts. Bulbar palsy and paralysis of the face and neck muscles are caused by bilateral interruption of the corticobulbar tracts and damage to the motoric cranial nerve nuclei of CN V, VII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Horizontal gaze palsy is caused by damage to ocular cranial nerve nuclei (CN VI) and associated visual paths in the paramedian pontine reticular formation. Despite the extensive injury, many vital functions persist due to collateral blood supply to the midbrain tectum (preserved blinking and vertical eye movement), reticular activating system (preserved consciousness), cerebral cortex (preserved language comprehension and cognition), and spinothalamic tracts coursing through the dorsal pons (preserved sensation). See “Clinical features of stroke by affected vessel” table.\nManagement of locked-in syndrome includes physiotherapy, which consists of passive stretching exercises and frequent repositioning to avoid decubitus ulcers.

The junction between the ACom and one of the paired anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) is the most common site of cerebral saccular aneurysms, which can manifest with bitemporal hemianopia (due to compression of the optic chiasm). Aneurysm rupture causes findings characteristic of infarction of the arterial territory of the ACA, including contralateral paralysis and sensory deficits more prominent in the lower than the upper extremity (due to infarction of the motor and sensory cortices of the lower extremity) and urinary incontinence.

TCAs are used in the treatment of fibromyalgia.","answers":[{"option":"Intravenous sodium bicarbonate","explanation":"\nTCAs block the fast sodium channels in the myocardium, which decreases cardiac conduction velocity, resulting in prolonged QRS complexes and cardiac arrhythmias. In cases of TCA overdose involving ventricular arrhythmias or QRS complexes &gt; 100 ms, IV sodium bicarbonate is indicated to alkalinize plasma so that protein binding of TCAs (weak bases) can prevent the drug from binding to the fast sodium channels. Additionally, sodium bicarbonate increases the extracellular sodium concentration, which makes the remaining fast sodium channels more active. In patients with TCA overdose, the duration of QRS complexes correlates with the likelihood of developing ventricular arrhythmias and seizures and can, therefore, be used as an indicator of the severity of intoxication. In patients presenting within 2 hours of TCA ingestion, gastric decontamination with activated charcoal can be performed if the airway is established and circulation is secured.\nAntiarrhythmics that are typically used in the management of ventricular tachycardia (e.g., procainamide, amiodarone) are contraindicated in TCA overdose because of the risk of worsening sodium channel blockade and/or QTc prolongation.","bool":true},{"option":"Intravenous naloxone","explanation":"\nNaloxone is the antidote for opioid intoxication.

Compressive lesions are characterized by pupillary involvement due to injury to the outer parasympathetic layer of CN III (which controls pupil dilation, light reactivity, and accommodation). Additional injury to the deeper somatic fibers of the nerve (which control extraocular muscles) is responsible for this patient's ptosis and “down and out” gaze.

Patients can present with ipsilateral CN III palsy but such an infarct would usually also damage other parts of the midbrain, causing further neurologic features based on the structures involved (e.g., contralateral hemiataxia, cerebellar tremor).

Pregnancy is an important risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome because of physiological fluid retention, which leads to edema of soft tissue in and around the carpal tunnel. The sensory disturbances in CTS are classically worse at night and pain on flexion of the wrist (a positive Phalen test) may be present. Occasionally, the pain may radiate to the shoulder, as seen in this patient. Most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome with an onset during pregnancy can be managed by splinting of the wrist. Surgery and corticosteroid injections are usually not required because symptoms usually resolve after delivery.","bool":true},{"option":"Ulnar nerve compression","explanation":"Compression of the ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon (cubital tunnel syndrome) may result in pain, paresthesia, and numbness in the hand as seen in this patient.

Also, this patient has no history that would suggest a cubital tunnel syndrome (e.g., osteoarthritis or trauma to the elbow).","bool":false},{"option":"Lower trunk palsy of the brachial plexus","explanation":"Paralysis of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (Klumpke palsy) causes deficits along the C8 and T1 myotomes and dermatomes. Although Klumpke palsy may result in pain, paresthesia, and numbness in the hand, these sensory disturbances are usually localized to the medial half of the hand and would also be present on the ulnar aspect of the forearm. Hand and finger weakness is also typically prominent. In addition, this patient lacks a history that would suggest Klumpke paralysis (e.g., upward traction on the arm, thoracic outlet syndrome, Pancoast tumor).","bool":false},{"option":"Demyelinating disease of peripheral nerves","explanation":"Immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathies such as Guillain-Barre syndrome can manifest with pain and paresthesias affecting the distal extremities.

While this patient is at increased risk for MS (woman of childbearing age with a positive family history), the association of her symptoms with sleep, its presence during pregnancy, and exacerbation with wrist flexion are inconsistent with MS. MS should be suspected if there are recurrent neurologic symptoms in different parts of the body (e.g., wrist paresthesia that resolves, followed by diplopia months later). MS exacerbations tend to cause symptoms that are persistent for days to weeks, until the flare resolves.

Diffusion-weighted MRI is the preferred imaging modality because it shows even small ischemic changes within 30 minutes after onset (while a CT scan shows changes only after 6–24 hours) and can differentiate acute from chronic lesions. If MRI is not available, a CT scan of the head can be performed. Besides neuroimaging, antiplatelet therapy should be initiated urgently because TIA is associated with a high risk of subsequent stroke. If TIA is confirmed, further workup to identify the underlying etiology is indicated. This workup includes neurovascular imaging to assess arterial causes (e.g., carotid Doppler ultrasound for carotid artery stenosis) and, in patients with suspected embolic source or unknown TIA etiology, cardiac evaluation (e.g., ECG, transthoracic ultrasonography). In addition, secondary prevention of TIA, including lifestyle modifications (e.g., smoking cessation) and management of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus), should be initiated.\nIn patients with persistent neurologic symptoms (i.e., patients with suspected stroke), the diagnostic workup for stroke should be initiated immediately.

The standard surgical technique is extracapsular cataract extraction. There is no pharmacological therapy available except in galactosemia, in which the cataract is reversible when following a galactose-free diet. Untreated cataracts eventually lead to complete blindness.","bool":true},{"option":"Administration of topical pilocarpine and timolol","explanation":"Topical pilocarpine and timolol are the first-line treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma, which can cause blurred vision associated with halos around lights and manifest with a hard to visualize retina (due to corneal opacification). However, acute angle-closure glaucoma is usually unilateral rather than bilateral, and patients typically present with a red, painful eye with a fixed pupil, which is not seen here. Additionally, the visual impairment has a sudden onset rather than a progressive course. Furthermore, beta blockers should be avoided in this patient with asthma because of the risk of bronchoconstriction.","bool":false},{"option":"Administration of topical latanoprost","explanation":"Topical latanoprost is the preferred first-line treatment for patients with open-angle glaucoma, which also causes bilateral, progressive vision loss that can be associated with halos around lights. Advanced age, diabetes mellitus, and steroid use, all of which are seen in this patient, are known risk factors for open-angle glaucoma. However, a temporary improvement in near vision and a fundoscopy showing darkening of the red reflex and obscuration of ocular fundus are not expected. Additionally, in patients with open-angle glaucoma, the visual field loss progresses from peripheral to central over time, which is not seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Intravitreous injection of bevacizumab","explanation":"Intravitreous injection of bevacizumab is the first-line treatment for patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), which can cause progressive and painless loss of vision. However, wet AMD affects one eye first rather than both eyes, and progresses over weeks to months rather than years. Additionally, this condition does not cause a temporary improvement in near vision, darkening of the red reflex, and obscuration of the ocular fundus. Finally, the visual impairment is usually central or pericentral and patients generally present with metamorphopsia and scotomas, none of which are seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Discontinuation of digoxin therapy","explanation":"Blurred vision is a common side effect of digoxin therapy, affecting 1–10% of patients taking this cardiac glycoside.

Prions, the causative agent of CJD, are resistant to standard sterilization techniques. This patient's history of meningioma that was surgically resected 20 years ago, along with a history of two similar cases at the same hospital, suggests that contamination led to iatrogenic development of CJD for all three of these patients. The latency period for CJD varies greatly, but periods &gt; 20 years have been documented. CJD is rapidly fatal and there is no curative treatment. The condition can only be confirmed by histopathologic examination of brain tissue, which typically shows evidence of spongiform degeneration.","bool":true},{"option":"Genetic","explanation":"Around 10–15% of CJD cases are caused by mutations in the gene that encodes prion protein, PRNP. This patient's father had dementia, which increases the possibility of familial CJD.

By leaning forward, the spinal canal is widened and spinal cord compression is reduced. Therefore, leaning forward will most likely relieve this patient's back pain. Activities that flex the lumbar spine, such as sitting, cycling, or walking uphill, also help widen the spinal canal and alleviate pain in patients with spinal stenosis.\nThe exacerbation of lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms by certain postures that narrow the spinal cord (walking downhill, standing, walking) is called pseudoclaudication. In contrast to vascular claudication, which is a result of arterial vessel narrowing and impaired metabolic demands of muscle tissue, pseudoclaudication is thought to result from increased metabolic demands of a compressed and ischemic spinal cord.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased ankle-brachial index","explanation":"A decreased ankle-brachial index is seen in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which also manifests with lower extremity pain with exertion (i.e., claudication).

Patients with MS typically develop episodic, multifocal neurological deficits due to demyelination at multiple sites of the CNS. Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques are typically seen on MRI in patients with MS as a result of reactive gliosis (reactive hyperplasia of neuroglial cells like astrocytes) following demyelination.\nAcute MS exacerbations are treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone. The treatment of trigeminal neuralgia due to MS is identical to the treatment of classic trigeminal neuralgia (e.g., carbamazepine).","bool":true},{"option":"Jaw claudication and unilateral vision loss","explanation":"\nJaw claudication and unilateral vision loss are seen in giant cell arteritis, which is rarely seen in patients under 50 years of age.

Trochlear nerve damage, therefore, causes hypertropia and vertical diplopia, as seen here. Hypertropia due to left SOM palsy worsens during right lateral gaze because the SOM is the only muscle that can depress an adducted eye. Hypertropia due to SOM palsy also worsens when the head is tilted toward the ipsilateral shoulder because the superior rectus muscle (an elevator) takes over the role of the paralyzed SOM as the primary intortor, resulting in elevation of the eye. To decrease vertical diplopia, patients with SOM ophthalmoplegia tilt their head away from the affected side (compensatory head tilt), like this patient who tilts her head to the right.

An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The MRI shows displacement of both the vermis and the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, which has likely caused an obstruction of the ventricular system. Symptoms like progressive headaches, dizziness, recurrent vomiting, abnormal gait, and papilledema suggest increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This patient's condition is almost always associated with a certain neural tube defect, which would explain the removal of the sac-like protuberance at the lower back soon after birth.","answers":[{"option":"Chiari II malformation","explanation":"\nChiari II malformation is characterized by a caudal displacement of the cerebellar vermis and tonsils (with or without the medulla oblongata and the fourth ventricle) into the upper cervical canal. The displacement can obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cause an accumulation of CSF within the spinal cord (producing a syrinx), or within the cranium (causing hydrocephalus). Patients often present in childhood with symptoms of hydrocephalus and resulting increased ICP. This patient's history of a sac-like protuberance on his lower back suggests spina bifida cystica, which is consistent with frequently associated lumbosacral myelomeningocele. The patient's MRI confirms the diagnosis of Chiari II malformation.","bool":true},{"option":"Vestibular schwannoma","explanation":"\nVestibular schwannoma presents most commonly with sensorineural hearing loss and possibly also tinnitus and balance issues.

While some patients may also develop symptoms of hydrocephalus, as seen in this patient, it typically also manifests with occipital headache, neck pain, lower cranial nerve palsies, a downbeat nystagmus, and radicular pain in the shoulders and arms, all of which are not present here. Moreover, it usually becomes symptomatic in adolescence/young adulthood, and a history of myelomeningocele is atypical for Chiari I malformation.","bool":false},{"option":"Ependymoma","explanation":"\nEpendymoma can present with signs of increased intracranial pressure, as seen in this patient. However, these tumors typically arise from the floor of the fourth ventricle, adapt to the shape of the ventricle, and extend through the foramina of Luschka and Magendi into the cisterns. It would be unusual for the tumor not to invade the ventricles and have cystic components on imaging, as seen in this patient.

However, choroid plexus carcinoma is not associated with meningomyelocele. Additionally, at least in the plane shown, there are no visible tumors in the MRI.","bool":false},{"option":"Dandy-Walker malformation","explanation":"\nDandy-Walker malformation is often associated with hydrocephalus, typically antenatally or early in infancy, which could explain this patient's findings of increased intracranial pressure. Although it is possible for myelomeningocele to occur in patients with Dandy-Walker malformation, such cases are extremely rare.

In cases of mild trauma, SDH can develop slowly and only provoke noticeable symptoms after days to weeks. Both this patient's age and alcohol consumption contribute to brain atrophy and stretching of the bridging veins, making him particularly susceptible to SDH. Management involves CT scan of the head without contrast and urgent surgical evacuation if there is evidence of neurological deterioration, the SDH is ≥ 10 mm, or there is midline shift ≥ 5 mm on brain scan.","bool":true},{"option":"Observation","explanation":"The patient has symptoms of cognitive impairment and neurological decompensation with a hematoma &gt; 10 mm on noncontrast CT scan of the head.

Cardiac examination shows a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur along the left lower sternal border. While the patient fixates on a target, administration of brisk, horizontal head rotations to both sides results in corrective saccades to refixate back to the target. She has an unsteady gait. Muscle strength and sensation are normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient's tinnitus suggests cochlear dysfunction. She also has symptoms of vestibular dysfunction, including oscillopsia, an unsteady gait, and an abnormal head thrust test. The etiology of cochlear and vestibular dysfunction in this patient is the same.","answers":[{"option":"Medication toxicity","explanation":"\nAminoglycosides, especially gentamicin, are ototoxic and cause cochlear dysfunction (e.g., tinnitus, hearing impairment) by damaging cochlear cells, and/or vestibulopathy (e.g., nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, oscillopsia, ataxia) by damaging hair cells of the inner ear. Loop diuretics (like furosemide) also increase the risk of ototoxicity by affecting Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporters present in the inner ear. The vestibular dysfunction of gentamicin toxicity is typically bilateral; accordingly, there is no imbalance between right-sided and left-sided input to the central nervous system, so patients do not typically experience vertigo. However, patients can experience oscillopsia and an abnormal head thrust test in both horizontal directions.\nStrategies to reduce adverse effects of aminoglycosides include once-daily dosing and monitoring of serum concentrations.","bool":true},{"option":"Vertebrobasilar insufficiency","explanation":"\nVertebrobasilar insufficiency can also manifest with an unsteady gait and bilateral tinnitus triggered by postural changes (due to compression of the vertebral artery) and merits consideration in this patient with a history of a cerebrovascular accident. However, symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency are typically episodic and would also include dysarthria, dysphagia, and paresthesias. Additionally, vertebrobasilar insufficiency would not cause an abnormal head thrust test.","bool":false},{"option":"Dislodged otoliths","explanation":"If otoliths become dislodged, the semicircular canal can become sensitive to changes in head position, resulting in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Patients with BPPV have vestibular symptoms, such as episodes of vertigo that are brought on by changes in head position, however, they usually last ≤1 minute. Also, cochlear symptoms are not a feature of BPPV.","bool":false},{"option":"Suppurative labyrinthitis","explanation":"Although suppurative labyrinthitis can also manifest with tinnitus and oscillopsia, it generally occurs following chronic otitis media or surgical procedures such as stapedectomy and typically causes unilateral dysfunction (due to localized inflammation in one ear). This condition is unlikely in this patient with both a bilaterally abnormal head thrust test and bilateral tinnitus.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased endolymph resorption","explanation":"Decreased resorption of endolymph is one of the underlying pathomechanisms of Ménière disease, which can also manifest with tinnitus and oscillopsia (due to horizontal nystagmus). However, symptoms of Ménière disease typically arise episodically for minutes to hours. Although ∼ 30% of patients with Ménière disease eventually develop bilateral involvement, it is unusual at the time of initial presentation.","bool":false},{"option":"Delirium","explanation":"\nDelirium causes acute alteration of awareness and attention and can cause hallucinations that may be interpreted as visual disturbances. Risk factors for delirium include this patient's advanced age and infection, but a key feature of delirium is the fluctuation of symptoms throughout the day. Also, delirium would not cause an abnormal head thrust test.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Septic emboli","explanation":"In patients with infective endocarditis, septic emboli originating from bacterial vegetations can enter the circulation and cause arterial obstruction with subsequent infarction. Arterial obstruction can lead to stroke, blindness, and limb ischemia. While a posterior circulation stroke (e.g., cerebellar stroke) could account for some of this woman's symptoms, such as ataxia, patients with stroke typically manifest with lateralized deficits.

For the past 4 months, she has been more anxious than usual and experienced dizziness on several occasions. She used to exercise regularly but had to give up her exercise routine 3 months ago because of generalized fatigue, and lightheadedness and shortness of breath with exertion. She has a history of hypertension. She takes lisinopril daily and alprazolam as needed. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is a tax accountant and has had increased stress at work recently. On presentation, she is alert and fully oriented; her speech is normal. The patient's pants are soaked with urine.

These features in combination with rapid clinical improvement after symptom onset suggest a specific etiology of stroke, which is further supported by the history of fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and lightheadedness.","answers":[{"option":"Irregularly irregular R-R intervals on electrocardiogram","explanation":"\nIrregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves on ECG are characteristic of atrial fibrillation (Afib). Although the classic signs of Afib include tachycardia and an irregularly irregular pulse, some individuals are asymptomatic or present only with subtle signs of arrhythmia (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, and dyspnea). The uncoordinated atrial contractions lead to blood stasis in the left atrium and atrial appendage, which significantly increases the risk of clot formation and thromboembolic complications. Dislodged emboli can clog several different arteries simultaneously and result in embolic ischemic stroke. Individuals with embolic stroke typically experience maximum severity of symptoms at onset, followed by rapid improvement if the emboli migrate outward allowing arterial recanalization. Embolic stroke from a cardiac source often affects young or middle-aged people with cardiac disease, whereas thrombotic or embolic stroke due to atherosclerosis is more common in older adults with risk factors for atherosclerosis.\nThe CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to calculate the risk of stroke in patients with Afib. This patient's score is 2 points (female sex, history of hypertension), which puts her at intermediate risk for stroke.","bool":true},{"option":"Ruptured saccular aneurysm on CT angiography of the head","explanation":"A ruptured saccular aneurysm resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) leads to hemorrhagic stroke. SAH classically manifests with severe headaches (often described by patients as the worst headache they have ever experienced) with a hyperacute onset, other meningeal signs, and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., nausea, vomiting) in addition to focal neurological deficits. In patients with hemorrhagic stroke, these deficits typically worsen as the hematoma expands. In this patient whose symptoms have rapidly improved, an embolic stroke, not a hemorrhagic stroke, is more likely; therefore, another finding would be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Intraparenchymal hyperdensity on CT scan of the head","explanation":"An intraparenchymal hyperdensity on head CT suggests intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Given this patient's history of hypertension, the index of suspicion for spontaneous ICH should be high. However, ICH causes hemorrhagic stroke typically manifesting with headaches (caused by meningeal irritation/traction) and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., nausea, vomiting) in addition to focal neurological deficits. In patients with hemorrhagic stroke, these deficits typically worsen as the hematoma expands. In this patient whose symptoms have rapidly improved, an embolic stroke, not a hemorrhagic stroke, is more likely; therefore, another finding would be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Valvular vegetations on transthoracic echocardiography","explanation":"Valvular vegetations on transthoracic echocardiography are characteristic of bacterial endocarditis (BE), which can cause septic embolization and result in an embolic stroke. Subacute BE can manifest with lightheadedness and dyspnea on exertion for weeks to months. However, most patients with BE present with constitutional symptoms, as well as extracardiac manifestations, such as petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, and/or Roth spots. In addition, BE typically develops in patients with a history of structural cardiac disease (e.g., rheumatic heart disease, aortic stenosis), prosthetic valves, IV drug use, intravascular devices (e.g., IV catheter), or poor dental hygiene.","bool":false},{"option":"Double lumen of the left-sided carotid artery on duplex ultrasound","explanation":"A double lumen of the left-sided carotid artery on duplex ultrasound is consistent with carotid artery dissection (CAD), which can lead to ischemic stroke.

Often, these seizures begin with an aura that may include feelings of nausea or seeing shiny lights. This patient's initial facial twitching and muscle contractions are characteristic of a focal seizure (repetitive movements on one side). The bilateral tonic-clonic portion of the seizure then manifests with loss of consciousness and rhythmic jerking of the extremities. After tonic-clonic seizures, consciousness usually returns slowly and a postictal phase (in this case, lethargy and confusion) begins. This patient's muscle pain on examination is likely due to the tonic muscle contractions during his seizure.","bool":true},{"option":"Sydenham chorea","explanation":"\nSydenham chorea typically manifests as a symptom of rheumatic fever 1–8 months after group A streptococcal infection and is a common form of acquired chorea in childhood. The rapid, irregular, and non-stereotyped movements of Sydenham chorea are usually generalized (involving the head, neck, and limbs) and continuous while the patient is awake, worsening over hours to days. Motor symptoms may be associated with impaired motor control, muscle weakness, and/or hypotonia. While the patient's history of a sore throat 1 week ago should raise suspicion of a group A streptococcal infection, the timing of the appearance of the motor disturbance (Sydenham chorea usually occurs 1-8 months after the infection) and the lack of other criteria suggestive of rheumatic fever (Jones criteria) make the diagnosis of Sydenham chorea unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Focal seizure with dyscognitive features","explanation":"Patients who have a focal seizure with dyscognitive features (previously termed complex partial seizure) lose consciousness during the course of the seizure.

PML is a demyelinating disease of the CNS caused by the reactivation of JC virus and is mainly seen in patients with severe immunosuppression (e.g., AIDS). PCR-based analysis for JC virus DNA in CSF confirms the diagnosis.

Edaravone, the other FDA-approved drug used in the management of ALS, has been shown to slow functional decline in some patients; however, its effect on life expectancy remains unknown. Another recently approved drug to slow functional decline in ALS is sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol. Patients with ALS require multidisciplinary care, including physiotherapy, speech and occupational therapy, noninvasive ventilatory support, and specialized nutritional support via percutaneous gastrostomy, if indicated. The prognosis of ALS is generally very poor and most patients die within 3–5 years of symptom onset.","bool":true},{"option":"Corticosteroids","explanation":"\nCorticosteroids are used to treat acute exacerbations of demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS).

However, the clinical course of MG is characterized by muscle fatigue that worsens throughout the day and with increased activity, and improves with rest, unlike in this patient with progressively worsening symptoms. Smaller muscles responsible for fine movements (i.e., the eye muscles) tend to be affected first, while larger muscles become affected later.

CVT can cause manifestations of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, altered mental status, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits) as seen in this case. Risk factors for the development of CVT include hypercoagulability (e.g., due to oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, and the puerperium), malignancy, and infection. In particular, local infections of the sinuses, mouth, face, neck, and/or ears (like this patient's recent episode of acute otitis media) can precipitate CVT. An increased serum concentration of D-dimer, which is a fibrin degradation product produced during clot breakdown, supports a diagnosis of CVT.

Which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?","difficulty":1,"hint":"A lumbosacral swelling that is not covered by skin, leaks CSF, and contains neural tissue is suggestive of myelomeningocele.","answers":[{"option":"Failure of posterior neuropore closure","explanation":"\nMyelomeningocele is a disorder of primary neurulation that results from the failure of the posterior (caudal) neuropore to close at 3–4 weeks' gestation. While myelomeningoceles can usually be detected on routine prenatal ultrasound or laboratory studies (i.e., serum α-fetoprotein), this patient's mother did not receive any prenatal care. Moreover, a folate deficiency due to a lack of prenatal vitamins is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects. Symptoms including lower extremity paralysis and sensory deficits, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and cognitive impairment are often present from birth, as seen here. Additional evaluation, including a head MRI, should be performed because approximately 95% of patients with myelomeningocele have an associated Chiari II malformation.\nAnencephaly is also a disorder of primary neurulation, and results from the failure of the anterior (rostral) neuropore closure.","bool":true},{"option":"Nondisjunction of the neural tube and surface ectoderm","explanation":"Nondisjunction of the neural tube and surface ectoderm would result in spina bifida occulta, a disorder of secondary neurulation. This nondisjunction results in failure to form the posterior vertebral arch and may result in lumbosacral swelling, as seen here. However, the cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissue are contained underneath a skin barrier in spinal bifida occulta and may only be noticeable by a dimple or tuft of hair. Moreover, most patients with spina bifida occulta are asymptomatic, and hypotonia would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Defect in neuronal migration","explanation":"Defective neuronal migration at 3–5 months gestation can cause lissencephaly, which results in the underdevelopment of gyri and sulci in the brain. While lissencephaly can result in hypotonia, a lumbosacral swelling containing neural tissue would not be expected. Moreover, additional signs and symptoms, including microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, and craniofacial abnormalities, would be expected in a patient with lissencephaly.","bool":false},{"option":"Proliferation of totipotent germ cells","explanation":"The proliferation of totipotent germ cells can result in the formation of germ cell tumors, which can also manifest with a protrusion. However, the most common germ cell tumors in newborns are sacrococcygeal teratomas, which manifest in the sacrococcygeal region, not the lumbosacral region. Moreover, no neural tissue would be expected to be present in the protrusion.","bool":false},{"option":"Cystic dilation in the central canal","explanation":"A cystic dilation in the central canal suggests syringomyelia, which also causes hypotonia in the lower extremities. However, syringomyelia is most common in the cervical region, where symptoms often present in a cape-like distribution prior to manifesting in the lower extremities. Additionally, syringomyelia is not associated with a lumbosacral swelling containing neural tissue because the syrinx is most often located within the spinal cord and therefore not visible on the skin. Moreover, this condition usually manifests at 30–40 years of age, rather than immediately postnatal.","bool":false},{"option":"Increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure","explanation":"An increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure can cause hydrocephalus, which can occur concomitantly with myelomeningocele with a Chiari II malformation. However, hydrocephalus alone would not explain the swelling containing neural tissue on this patient's lumbosacrum. Additionally, because the fontanelles in infants are open, neurological symptoms associated with hydrocephalus may not manifest at birth.

Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient most likely has common peroneal neuropathy because she presents with a foot drop (high stepping gait, weakness of foot dorsiflexion) and numbness in the distribution of both the superficial and deep peroneal nerves (dorsum of the foot and first web space, respectively).","answers":[{"option":"Normal foot inversion","explanation":"This patient presents with peroneal neuropathy, the most common peripheral nerve lesion of the lower extremity. Patients with this condition have normal foot inversion because the primary muscle responsible for foot inversion (tibialis posterior) is not innervated by the peroneal nerve. Compression of the peroneal nerve usually occurs just distal to the knee as the nerve wraps around the lateral aspect of the head of the fibula. Wearing compression stockings can predispose to peroneal compression (due to increased pressure at the fibular head). The deep peroneal nerve, one branch of the common peroneal nerve, innervates the tibialis anterior, which acts to both dorsiflex and invert the foot. However, it is much less important for foot inversion than the tibialis posterior is, so inversion is typically unaffected.","bool":true},{"option":"Normal foot eversion","explanation":"The superficial branch of the peroneal nerve controls foot eversion. It innervates the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles, which are the primary foot evertors. Because this patient's nerve compression occurs before the branching point of the peroneal nerve, the superficial peroneal nerve is likely affected, resulting in weak foot eversion.","bool":false},{"option":"Weak plantar flexion","explanation":"Weak plantar flexion is most commonly seen with injury of the tibial nerve since it supplies the posterior compartment of the leg, where the most powerful plantar flexors are (e.g., gastrocnemius, soleus).

This nerve root is primarily responsible for foot dorsiflexion and sensation from the distal lateral thigh to the medial lower leg. Though this patient's difficulty in dorsiflexing her left foot is consistent with L4 radiculopathy, her sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot and the web space between the 1st and 2nd digit would only be found with a common peroneal nerve injury.

It is one of the most commonly implicated triggers of SJS. Most cases of SJS develop within 2–8 weeks of initiating the offending medication. The risk of developing SJS induced by lamotrigine therapy is greatest when high doses are used, so the initial dose should be low and increased slowly. In addition, about 10% of patients treated with lamotrigine develop a benign skin rash that is difficult to differentiate from early SJS; accordingly, all patients should be advised to discontinue lamotrigine therapy at the first sign of a rash. Other commonly implicated triggers of SJS include allopurinol, sulfamethoxazole, sulfa drugs, and phenobarbital.

However, ependymomas typically arise infratentorially within the 4th ventricle. The 3rd ventricle, which is located in the suprasellar region, is an unusual location for an ependymoma. Moreover, bitemporal hemianopsia would not be expected. Instead, patients would have evidence of raised intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, vomiting, papilledema) and ventriculomegaly on imaging. Histopathology would show perivascular pseudorosettes and rod-shaped blepharoplasts (basal ciliary bodies).","bool":false},{"option":"Astroglial cells","explanation":"\nAstrocytomas arise from astroglial cells. A pilocytic astrocytoma, which is the most common primary brain tumor in childhood, can cause clumsiness, frequent falls, and urinary symptoms (e.g., frequency, incontinence). However, a pilocytic astrocytoma is typically located in the posterior cranial fossa (e.g., cerebellum), unlike the suprasellar tumor that is seen here. Also, bitemporal hemianopsia would not be expected and patients with urinary symptoms due to a pilocytic astrocytoma would also have evidence of raised intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, vomiting, papilledema) and ventriculomegaly on imaging due to obstructive hydrocephalus.

However, prolactinomas arise within the sella turcica unlike the suprasellar mass that is seen here and this patient does not have any features of hyperprolactinemia (e.g., gynecomastia). Moreover, prolactinomas are usually seen in adults (35–60 years), not in children, and histopathology would show acidophilic lactotrophs displacing the other endocrine pituitary cells, not a cystic mass filled with dark, oily fluid.","bool":false},{"option":"Arachnoid cells","explanation":"Arachnoid cells give rise to meningiomas. A parasagittal meningioma can cause falls and clumsiness (due to spastic lower limb weakness) and urinary symptoms (e.g., frequency, incontinence).

Telangiectasias may also appear on other areas of exposed skin, particularly the face. The decreased serum levels of immunoglobulins predispose to infections, particularly of the respiratory tract. AT is due to an autosomal recessive mutation in the ATM gene, which assists in DNA break repair (nonhomologous end joining).\nThis patient also presents with café-au-lait spots (hyperpigmented skin patches). These are common in AT as well as other neurocutaneous conditions, e.g., neurofibromatosis type 1.","bool":true},{"option":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia","explanation":"\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is typically seen in older patients (usually &gt; 60 years of age). Because many cases remain asymptomatic for a long period, it is often diagnosed late or incidentally.

The disease more typically presents with impaired vision, color blindness, the Lhermitte sign, and signs of upper motor neuron dysfunction (e.g., spasticity, positive Babinski sign), none of which are present in this patient. Furthermore, MS would not involve such a rapid progression within months of symptom onset. Lastly, elevated levels of 14-3-3 protein in CSF are not characteristic of MS.","bool":false},{"option":"Deposits of amyloid beta peptides","explanation":"Extracellular plaques composed of amyloid beta peptides and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (neurofibrillary tangles) are typical histological features of Alzheimer disease (AD). Although AD initially manifests with short-term memory loss, which is seen in this patient, other classic findings are absent here, e.g., impaired naming and language comprehension or temporospatial disorientation. Most importantly, AD has an insidious onset and progresses slowly over several years, whereas this patient's symptoms progressed rapidly within 4 months.

In addition, elevated levels of 14-3-3 protein in CSF would not be expected in PD.","bool":false},{"option":"Atrophy limited to the frontal and temporal lobes","explanation":"Loss of neurons in the frontal and temporal lobes is the defining histological feature of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although FTD can manifest with early changes in personality and behavior (e.g., inappropriate social behavior), which are seen in this patient, memory is typically unaffected. Furthermore, the mean survival of patients with FTD is 6 years after symptom onset, much longer than the 4 months seen in this case.

Treatment should be offered to patients in whom the condition causes intermittent or persistent impairment. Although the severity of essential tremor typically remains stable over time, some patients experience disability from tremor progression.

Its primary active metabolite is phenobarbital, which is responsible for its sedative effects as well as strong cytochrome P450 induction.","bool":true},{"option":"Propranolol","explanation":"\nPropranolol is a first-line drug for the treatment of essential tremor. However, this patient has moderate persistent asthma as indicated by his daily use of albuterol and fluticasone.

Examination shows irregular movements of the extremities and twitching of the face and tongue. Mental status examination shows impaired memory. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following changes on MRI?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient most likely has Huntington disease (HD) based on the presence of chorea (e.g., involuntary limb and trunk movements), behavioral changes (aggression, impulsivity), and cognitive impairments (impaired memory). His father's dementia may have also been associated with HD, which would be consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the condition.","answers":[{"option":"Atrophy of the striatum","explanation":"\nAtrophy of the striatum, specifically the caudate nucleus and putamen, is a classic finding on brain imaging in patients with Huntington disease (HD). HD is caused by CAG trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene, which cause aggregates of abnormal huntingtin protein to accumulate, resulting in neuronal death and gliosis in the striatum. The disorder is diagnosed via genetic testing, with neuroimaging used to rule out other intracranial pathologies.\nThe father, in this case, became ill later and possibly less severely than the son, a fact that can be attributed to the phenomenon of anticipation (genetics), a characteristic of trinucleotide repeat disorders.","bool":true},{"option":"Multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions","explanation":"Multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions on brain imaging are characteristic of vascular dementia, which would manifest with a stepwise deterioration of mental capacity, similar to what this patient is experiencing in that it would be progressive.

Even though familial forms of AD (e.g., with presenilin-1 mutation) can manifest in middle-aged patients such as this man, early symptoms would include impaired short-term memory and depressed mood, not impulsive behavior. Furthermore, AD would not account for the presence of chorea in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Extra-axial tumor with dural attachments","explanation":"An extra-axial tumor with dural attachments is consistent with a meningioma. Though meningiomas are initially asymptomatic in most patients due to their slow growth, a symptomatic meningioma could manifest with a variety of neurological symptoms, including mental status change, due to mass effect of the tumor on the surrounding structures.

Dantrolene is indicated for treating NMS after discontinuation of the offending drug (in this case chlorpromazine) because it decreases muscle rigidity and, consequently, body temperature and the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Benzodiazepines are also usually given to patients with NMS associated with psychomotor agitation. In addition, supportive treatment should be initiated.\nOther drugs used for NMS include bromocriptine and amantadine.

Imaging studies and blood tests are appropriate for atypical presentations, such as a slowly progressive palsy (which may be caused by mass effect from a tumor) or bilateral involvement (which may be caused by Lyme disease). Individuals with risk factors for the development of facial nerve palsy (e.g., history of trauma, travel to a region in which Lyme disease is endemic) should also receive further diagnostic evaluation.

Orbital cellulitis can be distinguished from preseptal cellulitis by the presence of pain with ocular movements and vision changes.","bool":true},{"option":"Suppurative spread of dacrocystitis","explanation":"Rarely, dacryocystitis can spread to adjacent areas, causing orbital cellulitis. However, this patient does not have a history of dacryocystitis and typical clinical features (e.g., localized tenderness in medial canthal region, epiphora, purulent discharge from the punctum) are absent; therefore, her symptoms are likely due to a different underlying disorder.","bool":false},{"option":"Viral infection from sphenoid sinus","explanation":"This patient may have initially had viral sinusitis. However, the persistence of this patient's symptoms for two weeks makes it more likely that she now has bacterial sinusitis. In addition, orbital cellulitis is typically due to bacterial rather than viral pathogens. Lastly, the sphenoid sinuses are located in the sphenoid bones near the optic nerve and pituitary gland. Therefore, spread to the orbit from a sphenoid sinus would be less likely than spread from a sinus that is closer to the orbits.","bool":false},{"option":"Dental abscess","explanation":"Patients who have recently undergone a dental procedure are at risk of developing a dental abscess, which can spread to the orbit and cause orbital cellulitis. However, dental abscesses typically manifest with pain and swelling in the area of the abscess and systemic symptoms, such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing and/or speaking. This patient does not have any symptoms that indicate a tooth infection or dental abscess; therefore, her symptoms are likely due to a different underlying disorder.","bool":false},{"option":"Orbital mucormycosis","explanation":"\nOrbital mucormycosis may occur due to fungal spread in patients with ethmoid or maxillary fungal sinusitis. Patients with fungal sinusitis typically have either poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, HIV, or a history of long-term steroid therapy, and are usually immunocompromised. These patients would present with palatal or nasal mucosal ulceration in addition to the other signs and symptoms of sinusitis. Since this patient is young, healthy, and is not immunocompromised, a fungal source of infection is unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Cavernous sinus thrombosis","explanation":"\nCavernous sinus thrombosis leads to proptosis and swelling of the conjunctiva. However, cavernous sinus thrombosis also manifests with symptoms related to the damage caused to structures that pass through the sinus, such as the cranial nerves responsible for eye movement (oculomotor, CN III; trochlear, CN IV; abducens, CN VI) and the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). This leads to ophthalmoplegia and loss of sensation in the upper two-thirds of the face.

Symptoms can be precipitated by administration of dextrose prior to thiamine.","answers":[{"option":"α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase","explanation":"\nα-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex converts α-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA in the TCA cycle and requires thiamine, in the form of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), as a cofactor. This patient developed Wernicke encephalopathy due to increased metabolic demand for thiamine during pregnancy in combination with increased loss and inadequate intake due to hyperemesis gravidarum. Patients with suspected thiamine deficiency should receive thiamine prior to dextrose to avoid the risk of developing severe lactic acidosis, which can result when pyruvate is unable to enter the TCA cycle and undergoes anaerobic glycolysis to form lactate.\nOther enzymes that require TPP as a cofactor include pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for use in cellular respiration) and transketolase (which converts ribulose-5-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate in the pentose phosphate pathway).

Poorly controlled hypertension is a major risk factor for the underlying cause of this CVA.","answers":[{"option":"Rupture of a small penetrating artery","explanation":"This patient most likely has an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) due to rupture of a small penetrating artery in the subcortical region of the left cerebral hemisphere. Arterial hypertension, as seen in this patient, is the single most important predisposing factor for intracerebral hemorrhage because it causes lipohyalinosis. Acute peaks in blood pressure can then lead to rupture of these weakened vessels, which was the likely mechanism of rupture in this patient. A noncontrast CT scan of the head characteristically shows a solitary hyperdense lesion surrounded by hypodense edema (most commonly within the basal ganglia or internal capsule).","bool":true},{"option":"Rupture of the middle meningeal artery","explanation":"An epidural hematoma results from rupture of the middle meningeal artery and is often caused by trauma. Epidural hematomas may cause headache, nausea, and focal neurological deficits. However, a noncontrast CT scan of the head would characteristically show a biconvex, hyperdense, sharply demarcated lesion located between the brain and the calvarium and limited by suture lines.

The clinical presentation ranges from acute loss of consciousness followed by severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and impaired memory and cognition to chronic, insidious onset of these symptoms over days or weeks following the initial trauma. Increased intracranial pressure may develop, resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion and focal neurologic deficits. However, a CT scan of the head would characteristically show a crescent-shaped, concave hemorrhage that crosses suture lines. In addition, risk factors for subdural hematoma include old age, cerebral atrophy, chronic alcohol consumption, and anticoagulation therapy, none of which are seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Rupture of a saccular aneurysm","explanation":"Ruptured saccular aneurysms (berry aneurysms) located at major branches of large cerebral arteries are the most common cause of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which may manifest with sudden onset of severe headache (often described by patients as the “worst headache of my life”), nausea/vomiting, and/or confusion.

In contrast to this patient's features, it manifests as paralysis of the intrinsic hand muscles (lumbricals, interossei, thenar eminence, and hypothenar muscles) and often forearm muscles (flexors of the wrist and fingers; sometimes also the pronators), which classically presents as “claw hand.” Klumpke palsy is uncommon in adults. It is most commonly seen in newborns following a birth trauma (i.e., hyperabduction of the arm during delivery).","bool":false},{"option":"Radial nerve","explanation":"The radial nerve can be injured by compression within the axilla (e.g., due to crutches), a midshaft fracture of the humerus, or repeated pronation/supination of the forearm. In contrast to the features seen in this patient, radial nerve palsy manifests with impaired elbow, wrist, and finger extension; reduced grip strength; and sensory deficits over the posterior arm, posterior forearm, and dorsal hand.","bool":false},{"option":"Long thoracic nerve","explanation":"\nLong thoracic nerve injury typically occurs secondary to chest wall injuries and axillary node dissection during mastectomy. Injury to this nerve results in paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle, which causes medial winging of the scapula and impaired shoulder abduction beyond 90°. Long thoracic nerve injury would not, however, account for this patient's sensory deficit over the lateral shoulder or the impaired external rotation in her arm.","bool":false},{"option":"Upper trunk of the brachial plexus","explanation":"Injury to the upper trunk of the brachial plexus results in Erb palsy. Paralysis of the deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles results in impaired shoulder abduction and external rotation, which are both seen in this patient. However, the biceps brachii muscle is also affected, resulting in impaired flexion and supination. Patients present with an extended, medially rotated, and pronated arm.

Compressive lesions are characterized by pupillary involvement due to injury to the outer parasympathetic layer of CN III (which controls pupil dilation, light reactivity, and accommodation). Additional injury to the deeper somatic fibers of the nerve (which control extraocular muscles) is responsible for this patient's ptosis and “down and out” gaze.\nAcute CN III palsy due to a cerebral aneurysm is very concerning for imminent rupture. A patient presenting with dilated pupils and a history of recent headaches should undergo an urgent MRI with MR angiography.","bool":true},{"option":"Enlarging pituitary adenoma","explanation":"Enlarging pituitary adenomas typically present with bitemporal hemianopsia due to compression of the optic chiasm. Sufficiently large adenomas can cause headaches and CN III palsy due to compression resulting from lateral extension of the tumor. However, a tumor at the optic chiasm is unlikely to cause an isolated CN III palsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Thrombosis of the cavernous sinus","explanation":"\nThrombosis of the cavernous sinus has a highly variable clinical manifestation because of the number of cranial nerves passing through the region (CN III, IV, V1, V2, VI). Patients with cavernous sinus thrombosis can present with headaches and unilateral CN III palsy. However, this patient does not have the typical signs of fever, unilateral periorbital edema, photophobia, and chemosis seen in cavernous sinus thrombosis. Moreover, isolated involvement of CN III without damage to any of the other cranial nerves that pass through the cavernous sinus would be uncommon.","bool":false},{"option":"Ischemic damage to intraneural arterioles","explanation":"\nIschemia of the intraneural arterioles of CN III is commonly caused by nonenzymatic glycosylation of vasculature, in which prolonged periods of hyperglycemia (due to diabetes mellitus) lead to irreversible damage to small vessels. The inner part of CN III provides motor output to the extraocular muscles and is most sensitive to ischemia because of its reliance on diffusion for oxygen and nutrients. However, ischemic damage to CN III typically manifests with a pupil-sparing palsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus","explanation":"\nDemyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) causes internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). When present bilaterally, INO is often a sign of multiple sclerosis.

However, this patient does not have nystagmus and the diplopia in INO is only present when the patient's gaze moves towards the contralateral side of the lesion, in contrast to this patient's resting diplopia. Moreover, INO would not explain this patient's eyelid droop, lateral and inferior eye deviation at rest, or the dilated pupil.","bool":false},{"option":"Infarction of the midbrain","explanation":"Infarctions of the posterior cerebral artery cause damage to the third cranial nerve nucleus in the midbrain. Patients present with ipsilateral CN III palsy and diplopia, which are seen in this case. However, such an infarct would usually also damage other parts of the midbrain, causing further neurologic features based on the structures involved (e.g., contralateral hemiataxia, cerebellar tremor).

The inconsistent use of protection can be a risk factor for STIs such as syphilis. Although patients with neurosyphilis may present with facial nerve palsy (due to meningeal syphilis), slowly progressive weakness (due to general paresis), or hyporeflexia (due to tabes dorsalis), these forms of neurosyphilis usually do not arise simultaneously and generally do not occur until years to decades after primary infection. Furthermore, the lack of other features of syphilis (chancre, lymphadenopathy, condylomata, syphilitic rash, etc.) in this patient's history makes this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies","explanation":"\nAnti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are seen in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Although generalized MG may present with limb and facial muscle weaknesses, the proximal muscles are more prominently affected.

However, defects in higher mental functions (especially memory deficits), and other general physical findings (e.g., glossitis, cheilitis, anemia) would typically be present by the time motor deficits become apparent. Because this patient regularly consumes multivitamin tablets, vitamin B12 deficiency is unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated TSH and decreased FT4 levels","explanation":"Elevated TSH and decreased FT4 levels are seen in patients with hypothyroidism. Antithyroid drugs such as methimazole, which is used to treat Graves thyrotoxicosis, may inadvertently result in hypothyroidism.

The most common neurological manifestation in patients with diabetes mellitus is a distal symmetrical sensory neuropathy characterized by distal sensory deficits. Although diabetic neuropathy may also result in diminished deep tendon reflexes (due to loss of the afferent pathway in the reflex), the decrease in reflexes would not be equal in all joints, and ankle reflexes would be affected more than patellar reflexes. Also, motor deficits and facial nerve palsy are not characteristic of diabetic neuropathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Positive Campylobacter stool culture","explanation":"20–30% of all cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in the US are preceded by infection with C. jejuni.

On T2-weighted MRI, glioblastoma multiforme typically appears as an expansive hyperintense signal, which represents vasogenic edema involving both the cortex and underlying white matter. The presence of a well-circumscribed, extraaxial mass makes this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Hemangioblastoma","explanation":"\nCranial hemangioblastomas are almost always infratentorial tumors. As a result, they manifest with features of elevated intracranial pressure, cerebellar dysfunction, and/or palsies of cranial nerves that arise from the pons and medulla oblongata. On CT scan, they appear as sharply demarcated, hypodense, intraaxial cystic lesions. The presence of seizures and a hyperdense, extraaxial mass in this patient makes the diagnosis of hemangioblastoma unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Schwannoma","explanation":"\nAcoustic neuroma, the most common type of schwannoma, is especially common in patients 40–60 years of age. However, seizure would be an uncommon symptom of an infratentorial tumor such as an acoustic neuroma.

This process is inhibited e.g., by vesamicol. Botulinum toxin, however, does not affect the vesicular acetylcholine transporter.","bool":false},{"option":"D","explanation":"D shows exocytosis of acetylcholine-filled vesicles into the synaptic cleft. Botulinum toxin inhibits this process by cleaving the SNAP-25 SNARE protein that mediates the fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is caused by neuron depolarization. Without acetylcholine release into the synaptic cleft, muscle cells will not contract, leading to flaccid paralysis.

The early onset of these symptoms suggests Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).","answers":[{"option":"Serum creatine kinase concentration","explanation":"\nDMD is an x-linked recessive disease characterized by progressive muscle paresis and atrophy that typically starts in the pelvic girdle, as seen in this patient. Because DMD results in a deficiency of dystrophin, affected muscle cells die, leading to elevated serum levels of creatine kinase (CK). In almost all cases of DMD, serum CK levels are 20–100 times the upper limit of the reference range by the age of 2 years (i.e., even before the onset of symptoms of DMD) and then decline at the rate of approx. 25% per year due to progressive replacement of muscle tissue by fat and fibrotic tissue. If DMD is suspected, serum CK concentration should be obtained as the first step in diagnosis and genetic analysis for DMD gene mutations should then be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If the CK level is normal or only mildly increased at the time of symptom onset, DMD is unlikely and a different condition (e.g., spinal muscular atrophy) should be considered.","bool":true},{"option":"Genetic analysis","explanation":"\nGenetic analysis is a complex and expensive procedure and is only performed if the results of another initial step are suggestive of DMD.

However, EMG has a relatively high false-negative rate for DMD, especially in the early stages of the disease, and this test requires the patient's active cooperation, which is difficult to achieve in very young children, like this patient. Electrodiagnostic studies such as EMG and nerve conduction studies are only considered in atypical cases to rule out neurogenic disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy.","bool":false},{"option":"Echocardiography","explanation":"\nCardiac arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy caused by cardiac muscle fibrosis are common life-threatening complications of DMD. Therefore, patients with DMD require ECG and echocardiography at the time of diagnosis (to establish baseline findings) and then at least annually for surveillance.

The majority of affected patients also experience an aura, with higher cortical sensations such as déjà vu and fear that precede the focal seizure. This patient experienced violent, jerky arm movements preceded by a “chill down his spine” and followed by temporary focal paresis without residual effects (Todd paralysis) upon presentation to the emergency department, which is consistent with the diagnosis of a focal seizure without impairment of consciousness, previously referred to as a simple partial seizure.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Sporadic transient tic disorder","explanation":"\nSporadic transient tic disorder, a subtype of tic disorder, is relatively common during childhood and can include motor tics, which appear as sudden, brief, and intermittent movements that are usually accompanied by an awareness of the urge to perform the tic.

Hemiplegic migraines specifically are defined by the presence of motor weakness as the manifestation of the aura. Migraines may also be preceded by prodromes occurring 24–48 hours prior to the beginning of the headache, which may include complex experiential symptoms such as depression and euphoria. While this patient did experience a feeling of a “chill down his spine” prior to the episode and subsequent reversible paresis of his arm, he did not experience the headache that is central to the diagnosis of migraine with aura, nor the associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia. Moreover, the timing of the prodrome and the development and duration of his paresis are not consistent with a migraine aura.\nSome patients with migraines may experience aura without an associated headache, also known as a silent migraine, migraine equivalent, or acephalgic migraine.

The rapid, irregular, and nonstereotyped movements of Sydenham chorea are usually generalized (involving the head, neck, and limbs) and continuous while the patient is awake, worsening over hours to days. Motor symptoms may be associated with impaired motor control, muscle weakness, and/or hypotonia. While the patient's history of a sore throat 3 weeks ago should raise suspicion of rheumatic fever, the timing of the appearance of the motor disturbance (&lt; 1 month after sore throat), the cessation of the movement after 2 minutes, its restriction to a single limb, and the lack of other criteria suggestive of rheumatic fever make the diagnosis of Sydenham chorea unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Conversion disorder","explanation":"\nConversion disorder is characterized by an unconscious response to psychological stress, either acute or remote, that manifests as a neurological disorder and is distressing for the patient.

Unlike other cerebral herniation syndromes, patients with subfalcine herniation have no pupillary changes and, in the early stages, can have a normal mental status. Severe subfalcine herniation will cause obstruction of the contralateral foramen of Monro leading to noncommunicating hydrocephalus from dilation of the contralateral lateral ventricle.\nThis patient's subfalcine herniation is most likely due to traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subdural hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage), given her recent fall involving head trauma. Without emergent diagnosis and treatment, expanding intracranial hemorrhage can cause rapid progression of subfalcine herniation to brainstem herniation and death. Emergency noncontrast head CT confirms the diagnosis and neurosurgical consultation is necessary for likely craniectomy.","bool":true},{"option":"Uncal herniation","explanation":"\nUncal herniation leads to compression of the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (causing a fixed and dilated pupil), the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery (causing cortical blindness with contralateral homonymous hemianopia), and the contralateral cerebral peduncle (causing ipsilateral paralysis).

RBD most commonly occurs in the second half of the sleep cycle, when the proportion of REM sleep increases. Affected individuals are typically alert and orientated after awakening and remember their dreams. This condition often affects persons over the age of 50 and is more common in men. A diagnosis of RBD is made based on clinical history (i.e., dream enactment together with complex motor behaviors and/or vocalization) and is confirmed by polysomnography.\nRBD can be idiopathic or due to psychiatric medications (e.g., antidepressants) or narcolepsy, but in older patients, it is most commonly a manifestation of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia).

This patient should be counseled that she is at greatest risk for which of the following?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Hearing loss and impaired balance in combination with tumors in the cerebellopontine angles raise concern for acoustic neuromas. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).","answers":[{"option":"Meningioma","explanation":"In addition to bilateral acoustic neuromas, which occur in almost all individuals with NF2 by the age of 30 years, NF2 can cause multiple tumors of the nervous system, such as intracranial and spinal meningiomas, schwannomas of other cranial nerves, and ependymomas. Most meningiomas are slow-growing and patients may therefore be asymptomatic for a prolonged period of time. If symptoms do occur, they usually include general symptoms of CNS tumors (e.g., seizures) or more specific symptoms that are determined by the location of the tumor (e.g., paraparesis and/or uncontrolled micturition if the tumor arises from the falx cerebri). Other typical clinical findings of NF2 include early-onset bilateral cataracts, seizures, skin nodules, and café au lait spots (see “Overview of neurocutaneous syndromes” table).\nThe clinical features of acoustic neuromas are caused by compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) as a result of the tumor expanding into the internal acoustic meatus. Sensorineural hearing loss, which is the most common presenting symptom, and tinnitus are due to cochlear nerve involvement, whereas dizziness, unsteady gait, and disequilibrium indicate vestibular nerve involvement.","bool":true},{"option":"Optic glioma","explanation":"\nOptic gliomas are often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Other tumors that may occur in patients with NF1 include benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors originating from neural crest cells (neurofibromas), pheochromocytomas, and nephroblastomas. The presence of bilateral acoustic neuromas, however, is not associated with NF1. Moreover, patients with NF1 usually present with typical skin findings (due to melanocyte dysfunction) such as café au lait spots and axillary/inguinal freckling, as well as musculoskeletal findings (e.g., scoliosis, tall stature, and bone involvement) and Lisch nodules of the iris, none of which are seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Telangiectasias","explanation":"\nTelangiectasias on the face and conjunctivae are typical findings in patients with ataxia telangiectasia.

Late symptoms include cognitive impairment as well as life-threatening conditions such as respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle paralysis and aspiration pneumonia due to bulbar weakness.\nThere is no definitive treatment for ALS. By blocking sodium channels, riluzole inhibits the excitotoxic effects of glutamate in the CNS and this effect slows down the deterioration of motor function in patients with ALS and thus increases life expectancy. Other medications used to slow the progression of ALS include edaravone (a free radical scavenger) and sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol (possibly an antiapoptotic drug).

In addition, polio is extremely rare since it has been eradicated from the U.S. and most other countries. Rabies usually presents first with flu-like symptoms and then progresses to encephalopathy, which can lead to respiratory failure if the respiratory center in the brainstem is involved.

CT scan of the head has a high sensitivity for SAH (&gt; 90%) especially if performed within 6 hours of symptom onset, but small bleeds may not be detected. Even though this patient has negative head imaging, his sudden-onset headache with nausea and vomiting is highly concerning for SAH and warrants further diagnostic work-up. Expected LP findings in SAH include elevated RBCs, high protein, xanthochromia (after 6–12 hours), and possibly elevated opening pressure. CT angiography is an alternative second-line test to diagnose SAH.\nIt is important to distinguish SAH from a traumatic spinal tap. In SAH, the amount of RBCs remains the same in a series of collection tubes, whereas in a traumatic LP the RBC count decreases (until reaching zero) over successive collection tubes.","bool":true},{"option":"Obtain an MRI scan of the head","explanation":"Once a subarachnoid hemorrhage is confirmed, MRI may be used for further surgical planning (e.g., aneurysm clipping vs. endovascular coiling). It is not, however, more sensitive than CT scan for the diagnosis of SAH, and is therefore not the most appropriate test following a negative CT scan. MRI is particularly useful for evaluating mass lesions, ischemic areas, and other interstitial brain pathologies, but involves more time and expense than CT scan in the acute setting.","bool":false},{"option":"Administer 100% oxygen and intranasal sumatriptan","explanation":"Oxygen and intranasal sumatriptan are the preferred treatment for cluster headache. Cluster headache typically manifests as a severe, strictly unilateral pain associated with ipsilateral physical findings such as lacrimation and rhinorrhea, which are absent in this patient.

Since phenytoin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome-P450 system (CYP450), the toxicity is likely due to the addition of a CYP450 inhibitor.","answers":[{"option":"Cimetidine","explanation":"\nCimetidine is an inhibitor of CYP450 and a commonly prescribed drug for relief of GERD symptoms. Concurrent intake of cimetidine and phenytoin will lead to increased serum levels of phenytoin that are causing the toxicity seen in this patient. There are numerous drugs that affect CYP450 and careful revision of a patient's medication list is imperative prior to any changes. See “Cytochrome P450 substrates, inhibitors, and inducers” table.\nSince phenytoin itself is an inducer of CYP450, half-life of this drug is dependent upon its own serum concentration. In therapeutic doses, a fixed percentage of phenytoin is eliminated over a given time. However, at higher concentrations, CYP450 reaches saturation, leading to elimination of only a fixed amount of phenytoin over a given time. This results in a longer half-life of phenytoin and contributes to drug toxicity.","bool":true},{"option":"Rifampin","explanation":"\nRifampin is a strong inducer of CYP450.

During his stay in the hospital, he suddenly develops confusion and agitation. Neurologic examination shows horizontal nystagmus and a broad-based gait. Laboratory studies show decreased erythrocyte transketolase activity. Administration of which of the following most likely caused this patient's current condition?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia suggests Wernicke encephalopathy, which is due to deficiency of thiamine (most commonly seen in patients with alcohol use disorder). Decreased activity of the enzyme erythrocyte transketolase, which uses thiamine as a cofactor, is diagnostic of Wernicke encephalopathy.","answers":[{"option":"Glucose","explanation":"The active form of thiamine, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), serves as a cofactor for dehydrogenases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, both enzymes that are essential for ATP generation. Thiamine deficiency (e.g., due to malnutrition or chronic heavy drinking) leads to ATP depletion, which primarily damages highly aerobic tissues such as CNS neurons. Infusing glucose in a patient with thiamine deficiency without administering thiamine beforehand precipitates Wernicke encephalopathy. The presence of glucose drives glycolysis, which leads to the production of pyruvate, and the lack of thiamine results in an impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The pyruvate cannot be metabolized into acetyl-CoA and enter the citric acid cycle, so the excess pyruvate is instead reduced into cytotoxic amounts of lactate. In addition, as a cofactor for the transketolase reaction of the NADPH-producing pentose phosphate pathway, TPP is also essential for the regeneration of the antioxidant glutathione. Decreased glutathione regeneration due to thiamine deficiency impairs free radical neutralization, causing further cell damage.","bool":true},{"option":"Disulfiram","explanation":"\nDisulfiram can be used to treat patients with alcohol use disorder. This drug increases the negative side effects of alcohol ingestion by inhibiting acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Rapid accumulation of acetaldehyde after alcohol consumption results in intoxication symptoms such as nausea, vertigo, and confusion. However, nystagmus or gait disturbances would not be expected. Administration of disulfiram is not known to precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Haloperidol","explanation":"\nHaloperidol is occasionally used in the management of severe agitation during alcohol withdrawal. Extrapyramidal symptoms, including gait disturbances, are common side effects. However, confusion, agitation, and horizontal nystagmus would not be seen. Haloperidol is not a known precipitant of Wernicke encephalopathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Cobalamin","explanation":"\nCobalamin (vitamin B12) serves as a cofactor in enzymatic reactions responsible for red blood cell formation and myelination of the nervous system. Deficiency is seen in malnourished patients (e.g., due to chronic alcoholism) and manifests with chronic neurologic symptoms, including gait abnormalities. However, supplementation of cobalamin would improve symptoms, not worsen them. Moreover, cobalamin is not known to precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy.

Typical early manifestations include vomiting, lethargy, and signs of hepatic failure. Agitation, horizontal nystagmus, or gait disorders would not be expected. Moreover, this condition is generally considered a childhood disease, and laboratory studies would not show decreased erythrocyte transketolase activity. Finally, aspirin is not known to cause Wernicke encephalopathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypertonic saline","explanation":"Overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia with hypertonic saline infusions can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome.

This patient has an internal hordeolum, which typically arises at the palpebral conjunctiva. External hordeolum is more common and typically arises at the lid margin. For both types of hordeolum, the first step in management is the application of warm compresses and gentle massage to promote drainage of the blocked gland. Additionally, eyelid margin hygiene (i.e., debris removal with a clean cotton swab) should be maintained. If the patient has severe symptoms or does not respond to conservative treatment after 1–2 weeks, an ophthalmologist should be consulted for incision and curettage and antibiotic treatment (e.g., topical gentamicin, systemic cephalexin).","bool":true},{"option":"Application of topical gentamicin","explanation":"Topical antibiotics, such as gentamicin, can be considered in patients with frequent hordeola or severe symptoms (e.g., concurrent blepharoconjunctivitis), neither of which are reported here.

Although chalazia can resemble hordeola in appearance, they are slow-growing and not associated with signs of inflammation (e.g., erythema, pain). This patient's clinical presentation is diagnostic of a hordeolum; therefore, there is no indication for an excisional biopsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Administration of intravenous ceftriaxone","explanation":"Intravenous ceftriaxone is used in the treatment of conjunctivitis caused by Neisseria gonorrhea. Although neisserial conjunctivitis is seen in young, sexually active adults, like this patient, the presentation is usually more severe with marked eyelid swelling, profuse purulent discharge, and hyperemic conjunctiva, none of which are seen here.

The boy states he was wearing his prescription glasses when the accident occurred and that, immediately after the accident, his eye was irrigated thoroughly with cold tap water for approximately 5 minutes by the teacher. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/78 mm Hg. Ophthalmologic examination of the right eye shows erythema and blistering of the skin over the eyelid, with conjunctival congestion and excessive tearing in the eye.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient's clinical features (ocular pain, conjunctival congestion, excessive tearing, marked blepharospasm), which appeared after exposure to a caustic chemical, indicate a chemical ocular burn.","answers":[{"option":"Continue irrigation with normal saline","explanation":"\nImmediate and thorough irrigation with sterile normal saline (e.g, via a plastic scleral lens) following an ocular chemical burn is the most important step to prevent permanent vision loss. Immediate irrigation initiated by first responders should continue for at least 30–60 minutes or until the pH of the eye has normalized. This process can sometimes take 2–3 hours for alkaline compounds such as potassium hydroxide because they are lipophilic and thus penetrate tissue more quickly. This patient has ongoing symptoms after just 5 minutes of irrigation. Continued irrigation in the emergency department should therefore begin immediately. Once irrigation is completed and the pH has normalized, broad-spectrum topical antibiotics should be administered.","bool":true},{"option":"Instill erythromycin ointment","explanation":"Broad-spectrum topical antibiotics such as erythromycin ointment should be given to all patients with severe chemical ocular burns and should also be administered to this patient.

The latter has likely occurred in this case as a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage.","answers":[{"option":"Preoptic nucleus","explanation":"The preoptic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus is the body's primary thermoregulator. It receives afferent impulses from thermoreceptors in the skin and, in turn, modulates the activity of the organs involved in thermal regulation (e.g., heart, blood vessels) to maintain a normal core body temperature. Other regions of the hypothalamus assist in thermoregulation: The anterior hypothalamic nucleus controls the cooling response (e.g., vasodilation, sweating), while the posterior hypothalamic nucleus controls the warming response (e.g., vasoconstriction, shivering). Damage to the preoptic nucleus can result in either hypothermia or hyperthermia.

Which of the following interventions is most likely to result in a decrease in this patient's intracranial pressure?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Patients with large strokes are at increased risk of developing cerebral edema in the early post-stroke period. An increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema can cause impaired consciousness, papilledema, and an increase in blood pressure with a reduction in heart rate (Cushing reflex).","answers":[{"option":"Increase the respiratory rate","explanation":"Cerebral perfusion is regulated by pCO2  and patients with raised intracranial pressure who are mechanically ventilated can be managed with therapeutic hyperventilation. Hyperventilation leads to a reduction in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) which leads to vasoconstriction with subsequent reduction in cerebral blood flow and fall in intracranial pressure. Current guidelines recommend titrating the respiratory rate to achieve a target pCO2 of between 28–32 mm Hg.","bool":true},{"option":"Decrease the blood pressure","explanation":"The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), depends on the ICP and the mean arterial pressure (CPP = MAP – ICP).

Absent sacral sparing in the spinal shock phase correlates with a high degree of autonomic dysfunction.","answers":[{"option":"Placement of Foley catheter","explanation":"Patients with spinal shock and absent sacral sparing will have impaired micturition reflexes (often with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia) and no bladder-filling sensation. This may result in acute urinary retention with painless bladder distension and subsequent complications (e.g., hydronephrosis, worsening bradycardia from bladder distention, bladder rupture). Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is the placement of a Foley catheter. Urinary catheterization also enables the assessment of fluid balance in patients who require careful intravenous fluid therapy for the management of neurogenic shock. When fluid therapy is no longer necessary, the indwelling catheter should be replaced by an intermittent catheter (ideally 3–4 days after the injury) to decrease the risk of urinary tract infection. Intermittent catheterization to decompress the bladder also prevents autonomic dysreflexia, a late complication of SCI above T6.\nOther important management steps in the management of SCI include venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, decubitus ulcer prophylaxis, pain control, and bowel care. Patients with SCI should undergo repeated, thorough neurological examinations with documentation of the findings. The return of any neurological function in the sacral segments after spinal shock resolves indicates an incomplete SCI and predicts the return of some degree of bowel and bladder control. The persistence of complete neurological impairment in the sacral segments after spinal shock resolves indicates complete SCI and a poor prognosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Surgical stabilization of the spine","explanation":"There is no consensus on the timing of surgical spine stabilization for a patient with vertebral column injury and SCI. Urgent surgical stabilization of the spine is typically performed if the patient has unstable injuries (e.g., bilateral facet dislocation), especially if the injury cannot be treated with closed reduction, or if the patient has progressively worsening neurological deficits.

This patient's findings of downbeat nystagmus, head bobbing, and truncal ataxia (evidenced by her inability to sit upright without propping herself up on her hands) indicate that the site of injury is the cerebellar vermis. Lesions of the medial parts of the cerebellum (vermis, flocculonodular lobe, and corresponding deep nuclei) affect medial structures of the body (e.g., axial and proximal limb musculature), resulting in truncal ataxia and nystagmus. Lesions of the lateral parts of cerebellum (hemispheres) affect lateral structures of the body (e.g., distal limb musculature), resulting in ipsilateral limb ataxia.","bool":true},{"option":"Cerebellar hemisphere","explanation":"The right and left cerebellar hemispheres are involved in complex motor functions that involve the limbs. Cerebellar hemisphere injury can cause loss of balance but does not typically result in downbeat nystagmus, head bobbing, or truncal ataxia (e.g., inability to sit upright without propping oneself up on the hands).

Midline cerebellar injury can cause head bobbing, truncal ataxia (e.g., inability to sit upright without propping oneself up on the hands), and nystagmus. However, flocculonodular lobe injury is typically associated with upbeat or rebound nystagmus, not the downbeat nystagmus seen in this patient, and usually manifests with vertigo.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Pyramidal tract","explanation":"The pyramidal tracts control voluntary muscular movement to the face via the corticobulbar tract and to the body via the corticospinal tract. Injury to the corticobulbar tract typically results in manifestations of pseudobulbar palsy (e.g., dysarthria, dysphagia, lack of facial expression). Injury to the corticospinal tract classically manifests with upper motor neuron signs (e.g., spasticity, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, clonus, Babinski sign) on the contralateral side. This patient's neurologic examination is not consistent with injury to either pyramidal tract.","bool":false},{"option":"Frontal lobe","explanation":"The frontal lobe is involved in several processes, including motor function, memory, and attention. Injury to the bilateral parts of the frontal lobe can result in a frontal gait, which manifests with a broad-based gait and difficulty with balance. However, a frontal lobe injury also typically causes problems with initiating gait, slow steps, and inappropriate compensatory mechanisms for changes in posture while walking. In addition, frontal lobe injury is also associated with the reemergence of primitive reflexes and deficits in concentration and judgment. Moreover, conditions that cause bilateral frontal lobe injury, such as Alzheimer dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and normal pressure hydrocephalus, commonly manifest in a more chronic to subacute timeframe.","bool":false},{"option":"Posterior spinal cord","explanation":"The posterior spinal cord carries the dorsal column, which is responsible for proprioception and sensation of pressure, vibration, and fine touch. Injury to the posterior spinal cord can, therefore, cause sensory ataxia that is worse in dimly lit settings, where a patient's proprioception cannot compensate for the loss of visual bearings. However, this patient's broad-based gait and inability to perform a Romberg test are not environment-dependent. In addition, there is no indication that she has other sensory deficits. Moreover, posterior spinal cord injury is not associated with nystagmus, head bobbing, or truncal ataxia (e.g., inability to sit upright without propping oneself up on the hands).","bool":false}]},{"id":585,"info":"Nervous System and Special Senses","question":"A 64-year-old homeless man comes to the emergency department with right ear pain and difficulty hearing for 2 weeks.

The specific connection between diabetes mellitus and malignant otitis externa is not fully understood, but may be related to increased pH in diabetic cerumen. Given the strong association between the two conditions, this patient most likely has diabetes. Also, the patient's lack of primary care access puts him at increased risk for the development of chronic diseases, like diabetes mellitus, and their complications.\nMalignant otitis externa is a severe infection with significant mortality that is most commonly caused by P. aeruginosa. This patient should undergo imaging studies (CT scan and/or MRI) to identify bone destruction and to determine the extent of intracranial involvement.

Since the middle ear communicates with the mastoid process, otitis media can result in opacification of these air cells. However, this patient likely has an infection of the external ear, which does not communicate directly with the mastoid process and is therefore not commonly associated with opacified mastoid air cells. The mastoid can be affected if the infection spreads from the temporal bone to adjacent bones, but a different finding is much more likely in malignant otitis externa.","bool":false},{"option":"Streptococcus pneumoniae infection","explanation":"\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of acute otitis media. Acute otitis media typically manifests with ear pain and fever, but more serious complications, such as osteomyelitis of the skull and cranial nerve palsies, are rare.

Normal blood tests, a negative toxicology screen, and the absence of findings on cranial imaging suggest that the patient has a primary seizure disorder.","answers":[{"option":"Electroencephalography","explanation":"In patients with a new-onset seizure, electroencephalography (EEG) is indicated if an epileptic disorder is suspected. Characteristic EEG findings – bursts of epileptiform discharges featuring spikes and/or sharp waves with an abrupt onset and termination – establish the diagnosis of epilepsy. An EEG may be normal during the postictal phase in up to 60% of patients, so a normal EEG cannot rule out epilepsy. In such cases, prolonged video EEG recording over 12–24 hours may be required. Certain procedures such as hyperventilation for 3–4 minutes, flashing lights, auditory stimuli, or sleep deprivation may be used to provoke epileptiform discharges.

Electrodiagnostic studies usually show signs of demyelination (e.g., conduction blocks, temporal dispersion), while CSF analysis shows albuminocytologic dissociation. Most patients have an acute upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection prior to the onset of GBS.

Consequently, a serum GQ1b antibody assay is used to diagnose GBS variants that manifest with ophthalmoplegia (e.g., postoperative GBS, Miller-Fisher syndrome). As this patient does not present with ophthalmoplegia, GCQ1b antibodies are unlikely to be present.","bool":false},{"option":"MRI of the spine","explanation":"An urgent MRI of the spine with contrast is indicated for patients with acute lower back pain and bilateral flaccid paralysis to identify emergencies such as compressive myelopathies (e.g., epidural abscess, hemorrhage, malignancies), spinal cord inflammation, or spinal cord infarcts. However, the combination of ascending bilateral peripheral weakness and cranial nerve deficits seen in this patient is consistent with GBS and would not be explained by a spinal cord lesion. While an MRI of the spine may show intrathecal spinal nerve root thickening and enhancement in patients with GBS, these findings are nonspecific, and therefore, nondiagnostic.","bool":false},{"option":"Cerebrospinal fluid culture","explanation":"\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for protein levels and cell counts is performed to support the diagnosis of GBS, but CSF cultures are not required. CSF cultures are used to identify the pathogen when fungal or bacterial meningitis is suspected.

There are multiple vesicles with an erythematous base located on the upper and lower eyelids. Visual acuity test shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause?\n","difficulty":3,"hint":"What infection associated with multiple vesicles are patients with atopic dermatitis prone to?","answers":[{"option":"Herpes simplex virus","explanation":"\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause nonpurulent conjunctivitis, which manifests with photophobia, pruritus on the periocular area, crusts over the eyelashes, conjunctival injection, redness, and watery discharge from the eye. HSV-1 conjunctivitis is more common in children and adults, while HSV-2 often affects neonates. HSV conjunctivitis is usually unilateral and often manifests with a vesicular rash and corneal involvement (e.g., dendritic keratitis). Additionally, patients with a history of atopic dermatitis are particularly susceptible to HSV conjunctivitis.\nHSV conjunctivitis is usually self-limited and resolves within 2 weeks, although neonatal forms can be fatal. The gold standard for diagnosis of HSV conjunctivitis is cell culture. However, typical cases in neonates or immunosuppressed patients should be treated without laboratory confirmation, as testing may delay treatment. In adults, treatment is only indicated in corneal involvement. Therapy usually consists of topical, oral, and/or IV acyclovir, depending on the severity of the disease, the age of the patient, and underlying conditions (e.g., immunosuppression).","bool":true},{"option":"Adenovirus","explanation":"\nAdenoviruses are the most common cause of viral (nonpurulent) conjunctivitis. The disease is highly contagious and commonly occurs in small outbreaks. Typical symptoms include itching, serous discharge, severe foreign body sensation, and conjunctival hyperemia, as mentioned in this case. However, adenovirus conjunctivitis typically affects both eyes, either simultaneously or in sequence. Most importantly, although it often presents with signs of systemic infection, such as pharyngitis, fever, and lymphadenopathy, it is not associated with a vesicular rash.","bool":false},{"option":"Allergens","explanation":"\nAllergic conjunctivitis manifests with itchiness, chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva), and serous secretion. Despite its association with atopic conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are usually milder than those of infectious conjunctivitis and do not include a vesicular rash.","bool":false},{"option":"Varicella-zoster virus","explanation":"Acute infection with varicella-zoster virus sometimes causes conjunctivitis. Patients are usually children and present with additional symptoms such as fever and a generalized vesiculopustular rash. The conjunctiva can also be affected in reactivation of the latent virus in the trigeminal ganglion (herpes zoster ophthalmicus). These patients are often older or immunosuppressed and present with a headache, fever, and a vesicular rash along the trigeminal dermatome. None of these features are present in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Staphylococcus aureus","explanation":"\nBacterial conjunctivitis is the most common form of infectious conjunctivitis in children.

Bulbar palsy can cause a symptom that increases the morbidity of patients with ALS and should therefore be assessed.","answers":[{"option":"Perform a bedside swallowing test","explanation":"\nALS is characterized by concomitant upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron dysfunction and can manifest with pseudobulbar palsy and bulbar palsy, both of which result in dysphagia. Dysphagia increases the risk for aspiration and/or insufficient fluid and food intake, leading to complications in patients with ALS (e.g., aspiration pneumonia, weight loss). A bedside swallowing test should therefore be performed in all patients with ALS to screen for dysphagia. If the test is positive, a formal swallowing study (e.g., videofluoroscopic swallowing examination) is required to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with ALS who have swallowing difficulties may need specialized nutritional support (e.g., pureed food, thickened liquids, nasogastric tube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). Bedside swallowing test is also performed for other neurological conditions that manifest with dysphagia, such as Parkinson disease, acute stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.\nIn addition to the bedside swallowing test, this patient should be asked about their wishes regarding resuscitation.

The patient presents with involuntary contractions of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle (head turns to the left) in the absence of other neurological signs. This is typical of spasmodic torticollis, the most common form of focal dystonia. Spasmodic torticollis is often idiopathic and typically manifests for the first time after the age of 30. Focal dystonia responds well to botulinum toxin injections.","bool":true},{"option":"Akathisia","explanation":"\nAkathisia is a movement disorder characterized by an intense urge to move. Affected individuals have difficulty sitting still and typically exhibit fidgety behavior (e.g., pacing, rocking). Movements are characteristically voluntary, repetitive, and driven by a subjective sense of restlessness, unlike this patient's involuntary, nonrepetitive head movement. Akathisia is most commonly seen as a side-effect of antipsychotic medications and antiparkinson medications, which this patient is not taking.","bool":false},{"option":"Athetosis","explanation":"\nAthetosis is an involuntary movement disorder characterized by continuous, nonrhythmic, low-amplitude, slow, writhing movements. It can develop secondary to basal ganglia and/or thalamic damage (e.g., Huntington disease in adults; cerebral palsy and kernicterus in children).

In addition to the classic findings seen in this patient, an overdose of anticholinergic drugs can also cause urinary retention, decreased bowel sounds, and erythematous skin (due to compensatory cutaneous vasodilation from hyperthermia). Use of physostigmine is usually only warranted in cases in which pure anticholinergic poisoning (e.g., overdose with atropine, benztropine) is suspected but can also be considered in patients with anticholinergic poisoning due to other agents (e.g., antihistamines) if they present with features of severe central anticholinergic poisoning (e.g., delirium). Physostigmine should be avoided in patients with tricyclic antidepressant overdose (TCA overdose) because of the risk of cardiac arrest. Ingestion of TCAs is unlikely in this patient as EKG findings are normal. Physostigmine should be administered carefully and patients should be monitored for cholinergic toxicity.","bool":true},{"option":"Naloxone","explanation":"\nNaloxone is used for the rapid reversal of an opioid overdose.

In some cases, genetic analysis shows a deletion in chromosome 1p that amplifies the N-myc oncogene. Neuroblastomas can occur anywhere along the sympathetic chain, the majority being located in the abdomen, as seen in this patient. They become symptomatic due to the mass effect of the tumor or due to metastases (e.g., orbits, bones). This patient's opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with neuroblastoma.\nHomer-Wright rosettes are also a histopathologic feature of medulloblastomas, a primary brain tumor that most commonly develops in children.
