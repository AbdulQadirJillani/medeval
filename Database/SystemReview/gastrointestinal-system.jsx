Also, α1-antitrypsin deficiency is inherited and would not be caused by long-term alcohol use.","bool":false},{"option":"Accumulation of iron in hepatocytes","explanation":"\nIron accumulation in hepatocytes is seen in patients with hemochromatosis, which can cause liver cirrhosis, as seen here. However, features of hemochromatosis also include diabetes mellitus, arthralgia, and bronze skin pigmentation, which have not been reported in this patient. Additionally, hemochromatosis is inherited or secondary to repeated blood transfusions in patients with hemolytic anemia. It is not a result of long-term alcohol use.","bool":false},{"option":"Hepatocyte swelling with Councilman bodies and monocyte infiltration","explanation":"The constellation of hepatocyte swelling with Councilman bodies and monocyte infiltration is characteristic of acute viral hepatitis, which would present with fever, jaundice, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and, rarely, features of acute hepatic failure (e.g., confusion, ascites, hypoalbuminemia, increased INR). Diarrhea is also a common prodromal symptom in patients with acute viral hepatitis due to HAV infection.

She has also vomited twice in the past 2 hours. Her musculoskeletal pain due to the motor vehicle collision had been well controlled with acetaminophen every 6 hours but the medication provides no relief for the flank pain. She underwent umbilical hernia repair surgery 2 years ago. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 99/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 102/72 mm Hg.

Mechanical bowel obstruction presents with acute obstructive symptoms (bloating, nausea, vomiting) as in this patient, but hyperactive bowel sounds and air-fluid levels (possibly with a transition point) would be expected in mechanical obstruction. Sigmoid volvulus also has coffee bean sign on x-ray in 60% of patients.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Effect of pain medication","explanation":"\nPain medications (especially opioids) can cause paralytic ileus. Opioids bind the μ receptor in the gut, which directly inhibits gut motility. However, this patient's pain was controlled with acetaminophen only, which does not cause paralytic ileus.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute mesenteric ischemia","explanation":"\nAcute mesenteric ischemia frequently presents as acute abdominal pain, distention, nausea, and vomiting. Acute mesenteric ischemia can occur as a complication of abdominal trauma and can cause paralytic ileus.

This patient suffered whiplash injury from her accident, which can be associated with mild neurologic injury and signs such as numbness and weakness. However, neurologic injury from whiplash is not significant enough to cause ileus and this patient has had no other evidence of severe neurologic injury (e.g., significant weakness). Significant spinal cord damage is, therefore, unlikely.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Small bowel perforation","explanation":"\nSmall bowel perforation causes acute abdominal pain and may be associated with paralytic ileus.

Although jaundice is one of the first symptoms, patients usually also present with pale stool and dark urine, which this patient did not have. Moreover, biliary atresia shows elevated conjugated bilirubin, whereas this patient has elevated unconjugated bilirubin but normal conjugated bilirubin.

However, patients with UC would also have symptoms such as tenesmus and mucoid or bloody stools (hematochezia), which are not reported in this patient. Fat malabsorption and steatorrhea are unusual in UC because the small intestine, which is the site of fat absorption, is usually spared.\nFat malabsorption and steatorrhea are more common with Crohn disease, which often affects the small intestine.

Which of the following changes is most likely to be observed in this patient? ","difficulty":2,"hint":"Abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea that occur after ingesting dairy products suggest lactose intolerance. Symptoms are caused by malabsorption of lactose in the small bowel, which leads to increased intestinal filling and bacterial fermentation of undigested lactose in the colon.","answers":[{"option":"Increased stool osmotic gap","explanation":"Calculation of the stool osmotic gap relies on the assumption that total stool osmolality stays constant and comes mainly from stool electrolyte concentrations. The remaining contribution to stool osmolality (i.e., the stool osmotic gap) depends on nonelectrolyte substances. In lactose intolerance, unabsorbed lactose and its fermented metabolites contribute significantly to stool osmolality, meaning an increased stool osmotic gap.\nAn increased stool osmotic gap is not specific to lactose intolerance and occurs in all forms of osmotic diarrhea (e.g., laxative abuse).","bool":true},{"option":"Increased stool pH","explanation":"An increased stool pH would not be expected in this patient, as those with lactose intolerance present with acidic stool (pH &lt; 6). Lactose reaches the large intestine due to insufficient hydrolysis by lactase. There, it serves as a fermentation substrate for colonic bacterial flora. Hydrogen and fatty acids are generated during fermentation, resulting in a decreased stool pH.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased breath hydrogen content","explanation":"Unabsorbed lactose undergoes fermentation by bacteria in the colon, a process that produces fatty acids and hydrogen. Hydrogen is then absorbed into the bloodstream, transported to the lungs, and exhaled. Therefore, increased, rather than decreased, breath hydrogen content would be expected in this patient. The hydrogen breath test is routinely used for patients with suspected lactose intolerance.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased serum glucose concentration","explanation":"In individuals with lactose intolerance, lactose is not sufficiently cleaved into the absorbable monosaccharides (galactose and glucose) that would raise serum glucose concentration in tolerant individuals. Instead, lactose is transferred to the colon without being absorbed. Therefore, serum glucose levels fail to rise after administration of lactose.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased urinary D-xylose concentration","explanation":"A decreased urinary D-xylose concentration would be expected in patients with malabsorptive disorders because xylose is absorbed in the proximal small intestine and excreted through the kidneys. Diminished absorption (e.g., in the setting of celiac disease, which can underlie lactose intolerance) would lead to decreased urinary D-xylose levels. However, this patient was given oral lactose, not xylose. A statement cannot yet be made regarding urinary D-xylose excretion.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased fecal fat content","explanation":"\nLactose intolerance does not affect fat absorption, though it can occur in the setting of other malabsorption disorders with elevated fecal fat content.

Although PBC is not directly associated with the formation of solitary liver lesions, it could be the cause of this patient's condition. However, PBC is much more common in women than in men. Additionally, the patient's history of hepatitis C makes another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Bacteremia","explanation":"In a patient with a solitary liver lesion on ultrasonography, bacteremia, as indicated by positive blood cultures, is indicative of a pyogenic liver abscess. Pyogenic liver abscesses most commonly develop secondary to biliary tract obstructions but may also be caused by bacteremia (e.g., in IV drug users). However, since this patient no longer actively uses IV drugs, he is not at increased risk of bacteremia. While an abscess can be both the first manifestation or a complication of this patient's condition, in the absence of fever, malaise, RUQ pain, and leukocytosis, this diagnosis is less likely. Ultrasound findings would consist of a fluid-filled, hypoechoic lesion, unlike the solid, isoechoic lesion seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Bile duct strictures alternating with dilation","explanation":"Multifocal strictures alternating with dilation on cholangiography is seen in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

As portal hypertension worsens in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, vasodilatory mediators are produced, leading to vasodilation of the splanchnic circulation. The altered hemodynamics result in renal hypoperfusion, which in turn causes a decrease in GFR.

ATN typically manifests with signs of AKI, so oliguria and elevated creatinine and BUN levels are consistent with this diagnosis. However, these findings generally develop much more rapidly than in this patient, and urinalysis would show granular epithelial cell casts and renal tubular epithelial cells. Lastly, as the most common form of intrinsic AKI, ATN can be distinguished from prerenal AKI and this patient's condition using the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). Intrinsic AKI is associated with FENa &gt; 1% because the damaged tubules are unable to reabsorb sodium sufficiently.","bool":false},{"option":"Renal interstitial inflammation","explanation":"Inflammation of the renal interstitium is seen in tubulointerstitial diseases, including allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN), which is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs, such as penicillins, cephalosporins, NSAIDs, and allopurinol.

Patients are otherwise asymptomatic. Defective organic anion transport proteins (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 within hepatocytes are responsible for the inability of the liver to store conjugated bilirubin in RS, which then leaks into the serum. Liver function tests are characteristically normal, except for predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Urinary bilirubin and urinary coproporphyrin I and III levels are elevated. Because RS is generally a benign condition, treatment is not required.\nLiver biopsy in RS, while not always necessary, would show no pigmentation of the liver parenchyma, which helps differentiate it from Dubin-Johnson syndrome.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Defective bilirubin conjugation","explanation":"Defective bilirubin conjugation occurs in Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Both conditions manifest with recurrent jaundice due to the absence or abnormal functioning of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme required for the conjugation of indirect bilirubin after hepatic uptake. Patients with Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II have mildly decreased enzymatic activity and may remain asymptomatic until adulthood (Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I manifests in the neonatal period due to a complete absence of the enzyme). As the defect lies in bilirubin conjugation, jaundice is due to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in both diseases. This patient's labs show conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia and increased urine bilirubin, ruling out these conditions.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Excess cellular bilirubin release","explanation":"Excess bilirubin release from cells is the pathomechanism of jaundice due to hemolytic anemia. Excessive hemolysis causes the release of large amounts of bilirubin, which cannot be broken down by the enzymes required for the conjugation process, resulting in unconjugated bilirubin entering the bloodstream. Hemolytic anemia therefore causes unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not the conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia seen in this patient. In unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, urine bilirubin would be normal.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Viral hepatic infection","explanation":"Viral hepatitis is a differential diagnosis of jaundice due to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Acute hepatitis A should be considered in a patient with a travel history to Mexico, where HAV is endemic. However, HAV usually manifests with symptomatic acute viral hepatitis and elevated serum transaminases. Chronic viral hepatitis due to HBV and HCV, both of which can be transmitted sexually, can manifest with recurrent jaundice due to cirrhosis, even in the absence of a past history of acute hepatitis. However, there would be other signs of chronic liver disease and/or serology would show elevated HbsAg titers (chronic HBV infection) or be positive for HCV RNA (chronic HCV infection).

Although the typical RUQ pain of choledocholithiasis is not always present, jaundice would not typically be recurrent and liver serology would show elevated ALP levels as evidence of cholestasis. As this patient's ALP is normal, it is unlikely that his jaundice is secondary to cholestasis. In addition, because less bilirubin reaches the bowel in patients with obstructive jaundice, the conversion of bilirubin to urobilinogen and, consequently, reabsorption of urobilinogen from the intestine would be decreased; therefore, urinary urobilinogen would likely be decreased.","bool":false},{"option":"Destruction of the intralobular bile ducts","explanation":"Progressive destruction of the intralobular bile ducts is seen in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a rare autoimmune disease.

While stones can form in any of the larger salivary glands, approx. 80% of cases occur in the Wharton duct, which is located in the submandibular gland. The diagnosis is usually clinical; imaging may be considered in patients with an unclear diagnosis or suspected salivary gland tumor. Treatment is usually conservative and includes NSAIDs for pain relief as well as salivary gland massage, warm compresses, and hard sour candies for salivary flow stimulation.

This patient has had episodic epigastric pain and heartburn for only one week, suggesting acute PUD, which can cause obstruction via inflammation-induced edema and tissue deformation of the gastroduodenal junction. In patients with chronic PUD, which is most commonly seen in individuals with long-term NSAID use or those with Helicobacter pylori infection, GOO can result from scarring and tissue fibrosis. Other causes of GOO include malignancy (most common) and strictures in the pyloric channel (e.g., due to Crohn disease, ingestion of a caustic substance, or chronic pancreatitis).\nIn patients with GOO, persistent vomiting can lead to hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and decreased fluid uptake, the latter of which can result in prerenal acute kidney injury evidenced in this patient by elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine. In cases of suspected GOO, upper endoscopy is used to confirm the diagnosis. Initial management includes nasogastric suction, electrolyte and fluid replacement, and parenteral nutrition.

Red signs on endoscopy (i.e., red patches on the variceal surface), as seen in this patient, indicate an increased risk for bleeding. Nonselective beta blockers (e.g., nadolol, propranolol) are the first-line pharmacotherapy for primary prophylaxis in patients with nonbleeding varices. These agents cause splanchnic vasoconstriction, which decreases portal blood flow and portal pressure, thereby preventing further enlargement of varices and reducing the risk of hemorrhage. Endoscopic band ligation is an alternative measure for primary prophylaxis that can be considered in individuals with medium or large varices and/or in those who do not respond well to treatment with beta blockers.\nBeta blockers should not be used in patients with acute variceal bleeding, as these drugs decrease blood pressure and suppress the physiological increase in heart rate.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Metoprolol therapy","explanation":"\nMetoprolol is a selective beta-1 receptor antagonist that primarily acts on the beta receptors in the heart and is therefore ineffective in the management of esophageal varices.","bool":false},{"option":"Octreotide therapy","explanation":"Intravenous octreotide is used in the management of acute esophageal variceal bleeding as it rapidly reduces portal pressure and helps achieve hemostasis, thus enabling endoscopic therapy of a bleeding varix.

This patient's visits to Mexico, which is endemic for Chagas disease, increase her risk for this condition. However, megaesophagus typically occurs in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (approx. after 10–20 years), which is inconsistent with her travel history. Moreover, the chronic phase of Chagas disease would usually manifest with other symptoms including arrhythmias due to cardiomyopathy (ECG shows no abnormalities) and/or abdominal complaints due to involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, neither of which is the case here.","bool":false},{"option":"Esophageal manometry","explanation":"\nEsophageal manometry is useful to identify esophageal motility disorders, such as achalasia. This patient presents with some typical features of achalasia including dysphagia and regurgitation. However, achalasia often causes weight loss, which is not the case here, and it would not explain the bubbling sounds while eating. Esophageal manometry is also useful for detecting esophageal involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc), which often manifests with Raynaud disease, as seen here.

Gastrointestinal bleeding provides gut bacteria with nitrogenous compounds (e.g., hemoglobin) that are degraded to ammonia, which is in turn absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Since the elimination of metabolic products is already impaired in patients with advanced liver disease, any subsequent accumulation of neurotoxins (such as ammonia) can trigger an episode of hepatic encephalopathy. Other precipitants include factors that increase ammonium production (infection, excessive protein consumption, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, hypoxemia) and factors that impair ammonium metabolism and excretion (e.g., renal failure, portal vein thrombosis, portosystemic shunt).\nTreatment of patients with hepatic encephalopathy includes rifaximin to reduce the number of ammonia-producing intestinal bacteria, and lactulose to decrease the amount of ammonia absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (lactulose provides H+ for the conversion of ammonia, NH3, to ammonium, NH4+, which is charged and not absorbed).","bool":true},{"option":"Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery","explanation":"\nMiddle cerebral artery occlusion typically manifests with sudden onset focal neurologic deficits, such as hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, hemianopia, and aphasia, none of which are seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Bleeding into the subdural space","explanation":"Patients with liver cirrhosis commonly have a decreased platelet count and elevated INR, increasing the risk for traumatic and/or nontraumatic subdural hematoma.

Moreover, ABO incompatibility would not explain her significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase.","bool":false},{"option":"Breast milk jaundice","explanation":"\nBreast milk jaundice is an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It is caused by an increased concentration of β-glucuronidase in breast milk leading to increased deconjugation and reabsorption of bilirubin from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal circulation (i.e., enterohepatic circulation). This condition is generally mild and tends to resolve after several weeks. In contrast, this patient has conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, breast milk jaundice would not explain this patient's significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase level.","bool":false},{"option":"Physiologic jaundice","explanation":"\nPhysiologic jaundice is caused by a transient unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that lasts for about ten days and is due to a relative deficiency of the conjugating enzyme glucuronyl transferase.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histological type of anal canal cancer and typically arises below the dentate line (see “Characteristics of the anal canal above and below the dentate line” table). Patients must undergo a biopsy of the tumor to confirm the diagnosis. Women diagnosed with anal canal squamous cell carcinoma should also undergo a gynecological examination for cervical cancer screening.","bool":true},{"option":"Internal hemorrhoid disease","explanation":"\nInternal hemorrhoids can manifest with anal pruritus, hematochezia, and a palpable mass on digital rectal examination. Furthermore, in a patient with irritable bowel syndrome, constipation is a common feature and a risk factor for developing hemorrhoids. However, internal hemorrhoids more commonly appear as dilated, purple or blue veins on anoscopy rather than an exophytic ulcerated mass, and, because they arise from the superior hemorrhoidal plexus, they are located above the dentate line rather than the anocutaneous line. Moreover, defecation is usually painless and weight loss is not expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Paget disease of the anus","explanation":"\nPaget disease of the anus can manifest with anal pruritus, pain with defecation, and hematochezia, all of which are seen here.

Although transabdominal ultrasound only directly visualizes stones in the bile duct in 25–55% of cases, the diagnosis can often be inferred indirectly from a dilation of the bile duct. It is a low-risk, noninvasive, low-cost, and easily accessible diagnostic tool that is readily available in most hospital settings and can help with risk stratification of patients with choledocholithiasis. Therefore, it is the next best step for patients with suggestive clinical features (acute intermittent RUQ pain), risk factors for cholelithiasis, and cholestatic labs, as in this case.\nThe next step following transabdominal ultrasonography depends on the overall risk of choledocholithiasis based on clinical presentation, labs, and ultrasound results. High-risk patients proceed to ERCP followed by interval cholecystectomy. Intermediate risk patients may undergo further diagnostic testing (MRCP or endoscopic ultrasound) or laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography.

Photoisomerization is the primary mechanism for the elimination of unconjugated bilirubin during phototherapy. Phototherapy is indicated for newborns with severe unconjugated bilirubinemia because unconjugated bilirubin is lipophilic and can cross the immature blood-brain barrier of newborns, leading to kernicterus.

Intestinal ischemia caused by transient hypoperfusion may be seen in patients with acute hypovolemia (e.g., due to severe blood loss, as seen here) or vascular occlusion. The splenic flexure and the rectosigmoid colon are at highest risk of ischemia because of the watershed nature of the arterial supplies to these tissues (i.e., watershed area). Affected patients commonly report cramping abdominal pain (usually left-sided), bloody stools, and tenesmus.

Moreover, transmission-based precautions (e.g., airborne precautions) are not indicated when caring for patients with LD because person-to-person transmission of LD is extremely rare.","bool":false}]},{"id":96,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of difficulty swallowing solids and liquids.

Other common findings include heartburn unresponsive to proton pump inhibitors, and weight loss. In most patients with achalasia, the etiology is unknown (primary achalasia). Secondary achalasia is caused by conditions that compromise esophageal motility, such as esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, Chagas disease, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis.

In patients with a pancreatic lesion on imaging, serum CA 19-9 levels may help differentiate between a malignant (CA 19-9 would be elevated) and a benign lesion. However, CA 19-9 is not an appropriate initial test because it is neither sensitive (may be normal in small pancreatic cancers) nor specific (is elevated in other abdominal malignancies and a few benign conditions) for pancreatic cancer.\nAlthough pancreatic carcinoma may manifest with chronic, recurrent, upper abdominal pain, and weight loss, such as in this patient, steatorrhea is not typically seen.","bool":false},{"option":"Endoscopic ultrasonography","explanation":"An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can identify early parenchymal changes in the pancreas in patients with suspected CP. The EUS probe is in close proximity to the pancreas, enabling better visualization of the organ.

Vitamin E deficiency can manifest as ataxia.","answers":[{"option":"Inactivation of pancreatic enzymes","explanation":"A gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) causes a large volume of gastric acid to be produced, which decreases intestinal pH. Pancreatic lipases, which require an alkaline environment to function, are inactivated and can no longer emulsify fats. This may result in a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (e.g., vitamin E), causing neuromuscular disorders, such as ataxia. In addition, increased gastric acid leads to the development of PUD. Finally, gastrin acts directly on the intestine and prevents sodium and water reabsorption, resulting in secretory diarrhea. Treatment of gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) includes proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) and H2 antagonists (e.g., ranitidine) in order to reduce acid production.

Hepatic tumors are a contraindication for this procedure.","bool":false},{"option":"Hepatic encephalopathy","explanation":"\nHepatic encephalopathy (HE) is caused by a buildup of neurotoxic metabolic products (e.g., ammonia) that occurs in patients with hepatic dysfunction. TIPS impairs ammonia clearance because serum-containing ammonia bypasses the liver; TIPS placement can, therefore, exacerbate HE and is contraindicated in this condition. However, serum ammonia levels are not always reliable and poorly correlate with the clinical manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy.

Accordingly, it is strongly associated with the use of oral contraceptives. Even though plasma estrogen levels are elevated in women with chronic, heavy drinking, like this patient, steatohepatitis is caused by a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Intracellular accumulation of lactate","explanation":"\nIntracellular accumulation of lactate and lactate acidosis can occur with increased activity of alcohol dehydrogenase, which breaks down ethanol by reducing NAD+ to NADH. An increased concentration of NADH within cells favors the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in an attempt to recycle NAD+. Increased NADH concentrations play an important role in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced steatohepatitis. However, intracellular accumulation of lactate is not the mechanism underlying steatohepatitis, which is seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased clearance of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine","explanation":"Decreased clearance of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) is the pathomechanism of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.

Loperamide does not act on acetylcholine receptors.","bool":false},{"option":"D2 receptor antagonism","explanation":"\nMetoclopramide is an antiemetic and prokinetic agent that acts via serotonin receptor antagonism and dopamine receptor antagonism. It functions primarily by blocking D2 receptors in the CNS but also blocks 5-HT3 receptors at higher doses.

The risk of gallstone disease is about 10 times greater among multiparous women than nulliparous women. Higher estrogen levels during pregnancy increase the secretion of cholesterol into bile, while higher progesterone levels decrease the production of hydrophilic bile acids, resulting in a decreased ability of bile to sequester cholesterol.

One to four percent of cases of mechanical bowel obstruction are caused by a large gallstone within the small intestine (gallstone ileus), in which case frequent, high-pitched bowel sounds would be present. However, gallstone ileus is a rare complication of gallstone disease (0.5% of cases). Moreover, an abdominal x-ray in patients with gallstone ileus would show air within the biliary tree.

The reduced acid production in AMAG leads to loss of negative feedback on G cells, which subsequently causes G cell hyperplasia in the gastric antrum and hypergastrinemia. Parietal cell destruction also impairs intrinsic factor production and causes decreased vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum, leading to vitamin B12 deficiency anemia (pernicious anemia). However, iron deficiency anemia may be present earlier in the disease course, due to the decreased solubility of iron in the setting of hypochlorhydria.\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can also cause G cell hyperplasia by inhibiting gastric acid secretion. However, elevated gastrin levels are usually not found.","bool":true},{"option":"Chief cell destruction","explanation":"\nChief cell destruction is seen in chronic gastritis with mucosal atrophy and would lead to impaired protein digestion due to decreased production of pepsinogen (which is converted to pepsin).

This patient should be advised to continue diligently with anti-retroviral therapy, which should improve her immune status.","bool":true},{"option":"Giardia lamblia","explanation":"\nGiardia lamblia is an enteric protozoan and the causative agent of giardiasis. Symptoms include fever, weight loss, and diarrhea. The recent history of hiking and drinking from potentially contaminated spring water (feco-oral transmission) and the immunocompromised status of this patient are risk factors for the development of giardiasis. However, the diarrhea of giardiasis is characteristically soft, voluminous, frothy, foul-smelling, and greasy (as opposed to the watery diarrhea in this patient). Also, the cysts of Giardia lamblia are not acid-fast like those seen in this patient's stool, making another causative organism more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Entamoeba histolytica","explanation":"\nEntamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis, is an enteric protozoan that is usually asymptomatic but can cause fever, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and weight loss in immunocompromised individuals. In addition, this patient's recent travel to Mexico is a risk factor for contracting E. histolytica as the protozoan is endemic in Mexico and is feco-orally transmitted.

It is the drug of choice for the treatment of both symptomatic intestinal amebiasis (amebic dysentery) and extraintestinal amebiasis (e.g., amebic liver abscess). Tinidazole is an effective alternative to metronidazole. Following treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole, all patients with amebiasis should also receive an intraluminal amebicide such as paromomycin or iodoquinol in order to eliminate intestinal carriage of E. histolytica.","bool":true},{"option":"Ciprofloxacin","explanation":"\nCiprofloxacin can be used to treat severe dysentery caused by Campylobacter jejuni or Yersinia enterocolitica, which can present similarly with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.

The results of a complete blood count show no abnormalities and a test of the stool for occult blood is negative. A lateral x-ray of the abdomen with oral contrast is shown. Additional workup rules out malignancy and confirms the cause of his symptoms to be an anatomical abnormality. The most likely cause of his condition is due to a defect in which of the following embryologic processes?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The upper GI series reveals oral contrast in the stomach and the duodenal bulb, with minimal contrast in the descending part of the duodenum (L1–L3 level) indicating obstruction in this region. This finding resembles the double bubble sign seen on a plain anterior-view abdominal radiograph. Some oral contrast reaches the distal small intestine indicating incomplete obstruction. Duodenal obstruction can be due to an intrinsic cause (e.g., duodenal atresia) or an extrinsic one (e.g., compression).","answers":[{"option":"Rotation of the ventral pancreatic bud","explanation":"During embryologic development of the pancreas, the endoderm forms two buds: a ventral and a dorsal one. In the process of foregut rotation, the ventral pancreatic bud normally fuses with the dorsal pancreatic bud. A defect in this process can lead to the fusion of abnormally rotated buds, resulting in a ring of pancreatic tissue (annular pancreas), which surrounds and compresses the second part of the duodenum. The manifestations of an annular pancreas vary depending on the severity of duodenal obstruction and the age of symptom onset has a bimodal distribution. Most patients have incomplete obstruction and remain asymptomatic until adulthood when they may experience features of chronic proximal small bowel obstruction and acute or chronic pancreatitis. Complete obstruction causes maternal polyhydramnios and neonatal feeding intolerance and vomiting (typically non-bilious, but can be bilious if the obstruction is distal to the major duodenal papilla).","bool":true},{"option":"Recanalization of the duodenum","explanation":"Incomplete duodenal recanalization during weeks eight to ten of embryonic development leads to duodenal atresia, which would cause features of proximal small bowel obstruction and narrowing of the second part of the duodenum on upper GI series, as seen here. However, duodenal atresia manifests acutely in the neonatal period, not with chronic symptoms during adulthood. This patient has a cause of duodenal obstruction that can manifest in adulthood despite being an embryological abnormality.","bool":false},{"option":"Closure of the umbilical ring","explanation":"Incomplete umbilical ring closure after physiologic herniation of the intestines during embryological development leads to a congenital umbilical hernia. Although incarceration or strangulation of bowel loops in a hernial sac can cause intestinal obstruction, these complications are extremely uncommon with a congenital umbilical hernia. This adult patient's chronic presentation and upper GI series findings indicate a different underlying cause of bowel obstruction.","bool":false},{"option":"Migration of neural crest cells","explanation":"Failure of migration of neural crest cells to the distal colon during embryonic development causes Hirschsprung disease.

Liquefaction is due to the release of neutrophilic enzymes that degrade tissue into a liquid, viscous mass. Liquefactive necrosis is commonly seen in bacterial abscesses and brain infarcts. However, it rarely occurs in the liver and in conjunction with a viral infection such as hepatitis A.","bool":false},{"option":"Acellular debris surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages","explanation":"Acellular debris with encapsulating inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and macrophages, is characteristic of caseous necrosis. This process is typically seen in tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and coccidioidomycosis, each of which could cause focal necrosis in the liver. However, hepatitis A is not associated with the formation of caseous necrosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Basophilic adipocyte remnants, filled with calcifications","explanation":"Remnants of basophilic adipocytes with calcification are characteristic of fat necrosis. Fat necrosis occurs due to the release of lipases that degrade triglycerides, causing saponification.

Additionally, B. cereus produces two different enterotoxins that can cause two distinct food poisoning syndromes: the emetic form and the diarrheal form. The emetic form is caused by heat-stable cereulide toxin. Because the toxin survives reheating, this form is commonly associated with reheated starch-containing foods (e.g., rice) and manifests shortly after ingestion predominantly with nausea and vomiting, not diarrhea. The diarrheal form is caused by heat-labile enterotoxin II and is associated with a broad range of improperly refrigerated food (e.g., meat, vegetables).

As both result in lifelong immunity, this laboratory constellation rules out acute infection. Additionally, if the patient had an acute HAV infection, the serology would be positive for HAV-IgM antibodies.","bool":false},{"option":"Inactive chronic hepatitis B infection","explanation":"The largest group of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are inactive carriers. In these patients, the immune system's response slows viral replication, which is why HBeAg (an indicator of viral replication) would be undetectable, whereas it is positive in this patient. Additionally, due to the low number of viral particles in inactive HBV infection, the disease burden would be very low and this patient's findings (e.g., elevated transaminases, icterus) would be unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Resolved acute hepatitis B infection","explanation":"For hepatitis B virus (HBV) to be considered resolved, all viral particles must be cleared from the host. In contrast to this patient, in a patient with a resolved HBV infection, viral antigens (HBsAg, HBeAg) would be undetectable, but antibodies against the viral antigens would remain detectable (anti-HBs, anti-HBc).","bool":false},{"option":"Alcoholic hepatitis","explanation":"\nAlcoholic hepatitis can resemble viral hepatitis, as it also manifests with fatigue, jaundice, and tender hepatomegaly. However, the two conditions can be differentiated based on the AST to ALT ratio, which estimates liver damage. AST is mostly found in the mitochondria, whereas ALT is found mostly in the cytosol. A high ratio means that more AST is released from mitochondria than ALT from the cytosol, which correlates with a higher degree of tissue damage. Alcoholic hepatitis is known to cause the most severe increase in the ratio, with AST commonly exceeding ALT by a factor of 2.5. Liver damage in viral hepatitis is often mild and as such, the AST to ALT ratio remains below 1 as it does in this case (488 to 798).","bool":false},{"option":"Acute hepatitis B infection","explanation":"Because the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is positive, the possible differentials are limited to acute, active chronic, and inactive chronic hepatitis B. HBsAg is only negative in an infected patient during the window period or if the virus is successfully cleared from circulation. In acute infection, IgM antibodies against the core antigen would be expected, however, as opposed to IgG antibodies.","bool":false}]},{"id":147,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of blood in his stool for the past week.

There is no clear cut-off value because the diagnosis of a chronic versus acute transplant rejection is based on biopsy findings; 6 months is an approximation. The pathophysiology of chronic graft rejection is not completely understood, but a host T cell-mediated response is believed to play a role. Chronic hepatic allograft rejection manifests with progressive hepatic dysfunction and cholestasis. On a liver biopsy, fibrosis and hepatic ductopenia are the most common findings. Obliterative arteriopathy, which is characteristic of chronic rejection of other allografts, is usually less evident because it mainly affects larger perihilar arteries.

However, FCH is characterized by periportal fibrosis and/or pericellular fibrosis rather than perivenular fibrosis, and other findings such as hepatocyte swelling would be seen. Moreover, this patient was treated with the direct-acting antiviral glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, which has a very high rate of sustained virologic response. Hepatic CMV, EBV, or HHV-6 infection does not cause fibrosis or ductopenia in the liver graft. CMV infection is also less likely because the patient received ganciclovir prophylaxis.","bool":false},{"option":"Recurrence of primary disease","explanation":"The primary disease for which liver transplantation was performed (i.e., alcoholic cirrhosis) would not recur in this patient because he completely abstains from drinking alcohol. His other primary disease, hepatitis C, could progress more rapidly following transplantation because of immunosuppressive therapy.

However, this patient was treated with the direct-acting antiviral glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, which has a very high rate of sustained virologic response. Moreover, de-novo HCC typically arises several years after transplantation rather than within a few months, and this patient's liver biopsy does not show any evidence of malignancy.

Moreover, IBD would not explain this patient's cutaneous flushing, telangiectasia, and wheezing.","bool":false},{"option":"Chronic appendicitis","explanation":"Chronic appendicitis typically manifests with right lower quadrant pain persisting for more than three weeks. The diagnosis is usually made by postoperative relief of symptoms and histopathological confirmation of appendicitis. Chronic appendicitis can manifest with abdominal tenderness, along with normal markers of inflammation (CRP, leukocyte count). However, it is not associated with cutaneous flushing, telangiectasia, or pulmonary symptoms, making another diagnosis more likely.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Bronchogenic carcinoma","explanation":"\nBronchogenic carcinoma (especially small cell lung carcinoma) is associated with various paraneoplastic syndromes.

Meckel diverticulum is a true diverticulum that may contain ectopic gastric mucosa and/or pancreatic tissue. Acid-secretion by gastric mucosa within the diverticulum results in ileal ulceration and subsequent bleeding. Consequently, chronic blood loss can lead to iron deficiency anemia, and thus a low MCV, as seen in this patient.\nThe sensitivity of technetium-99m pertechnetate scan is lower in adults because the adult population tends to have a higher percentage of Meckel diverticulum that lacks ectopic gastric mucosa. False positives may be seen in intussusception and inflammatory bowel disease.","bool":true},{"option":"Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray","explanation":"Plain abdominal x-ray showing double bubble sign is suggestive of duodenal atresia.

This disease can manifest with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and subsequent microcytic anemia, as seen in this patient. However, UC is also associated with abdominal pain, tenesmus, failure to thrive, and extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., uveitis, arthritis, erythema nodosum). Furthermore, the peak incidence of UC is 15–35 years; and therefore, it is unlikely in this 15-month-old patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Cobblestone mucosa on colonoscopy","explanation":"Cobblestone mucosa (due to linear ulcerations of the mucosa) is a classical colonoscopic finding of Crohn disease (CD). Although intestinal blood loss in CD can cause iron deficiency anemia and a low MCV, as seen in this patient, this condition is associated with further symptoms such as nonbloody chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and failure to thrive. Moreover, since the peak incidence of CD is 15–35 years, it is unlikely in this 15-month old patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Absent ganglionic cells on rectal suction biopsy","explanation":"\nRectal suction biopsy showing absent ganglionic cells is diagnostic of Hirschsprung's disease.

In the case of fulminant hepatic failure, the probability of spontaneous recovery must be weighed against the benefit of emergent liver transplantation. Patient age, the underlying cause of liver failure, degree of encephalopathy, and evidence of liver dysfunction are the most important deciding factors. Because this patient is over 40 years old, tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, has a high grade of encephalopathy (asterixis, marked confusion), and continues to show significant liver dysfunction (elevated PT, INR, and total bilirubin), she should be referred for liver transplantation, given the lower probability of spontaneous hepatic recovery.","bool":true},{"option":"Glucocorticoid therapy","explanation":"While glucocorticoids may be considered in severe alcoholic and autoimmune hepatitis, they should be avoided in patients with acute liver failure because they further increase the already increased risk of infection and sepsis.","bool":false},{"option":"N-acetylcysteine therapy","explanation":"\nN-acetylcysteine (NAC) is indicated for the treatment of acetaminophen toxicity, which can result in irreversible liver injury due to the accumulation of the highly reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI).

However, endometriosis is associated with dyschezia (i.e., painful defecation) rather than pain that is relieved after defecation.","bool":false},{"option":"Celiac disease","explanation":"\nCeliac disease can manifest with chronic episodes of abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. However, celiac disease is typically associated with nausea, vomiting, steatorrhea, and symptoms of malabsorption (fatigue, weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiencies), none of which is seen in this patient. In addition, the autoimmune reaction within the small intestine seen in celiac disease is caused by exposure to gliadin. Moreover, IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibodies are usually positive in symptomatic patients (i.e., on a gluten-containing diet) unless the patient has IgA deficiency.","bool":false},{"option":"Colon cancer","explanation":"\nColon cancer can manifest with abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. However, colon cancer is rare before 30 years of age in the absence of inherited disorders (e.g., familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome) and is usually associated with weight loss. Moreover, right-sided colon cancers tend to manifest with iron deficiency anemia, while left-sided cancers tend to manifest with progressively worsening bowel obstruction and decreased stool caliber (i.e., pencil-shaped stool), which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.","bool":false},{"option":"Uterine leiomyoma","explanation":"\nUterine leiomyoma can manifest with constipation, dysmenorrhea, and recurrent pain. However, the pain tends to be localized to the pelvis and back and patients often have menorrhagia and/or metrorrhagia with/without iron deficiency anemia, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.

Since every episode of variceal bleeding carries a 20–30% mortality rate, secondary prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding should be initiated as soon as there has been no evidence of variceal bleeding for 24 hours.","answers":[{"option":"Ligation of remaining varices","explanation":"\nEndoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) should be performed every 1–2 weeks until all remaining varices have been obliterated, after which endoscopic examination should be performed every 3–6 months. In addition to EVL, medical therapy with nonselective beta blockers (e.g., propranolol) should be initiated. Nonselective beta blockers inhibit β2-adrenoreceptors in the gastrointestinal tract, causing splanchnic vasoconstriction, which decreases the volume of blood in the portal veins and therefore decreases portal venous pressure. The rebleeding rate is 15% with a combination of propranolol and EVL, as propranolol prevents variceal bleeding until the varices are obliterated by EVL, compared to 20–30% with EVL alone and 40–45% with propranolol alone.","bool":true},{"option":"Isosorbide mononitrate therapy","explanation":"\nNitrates, such as isosorbide mononitrate, can reduce portal pressure synergistically with beta blockers. However, studies have not found a decreased overall mortality or risk of rebleeding of combination therapy compared to beta blocker monotherapy. Adding isosorbide mononitrate can be considered if there is no reduction in portal pressure in response to beta blocker therapy, but, given the risk of adverse effects (e.g., hypotension, dizziness) combination therapy is not the initial treatment of choice.","bool":false},{"option":"Placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt","explanation":"\nTransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), while extremely effective in decreasing portal venous pressure and preventing variceal rebleeding, carries a significant risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to diversion of blood away from the liver.

His history of alcohol use suggests an underlying condition that is often caused by chronic alcohol use.","answers":[{"option":"Pancreatic pseudocyst","explanation":"A pancreatic pseudocyst, which is a complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis, is caused by leakage of pancreatic exocrine secretions from damaged ducts. This patient's history of recurrent epigastric pain, vomiting, and chronic alcohol consumption makes a diagnosis of pancreatitis highly likely. Patients with chronic pancreatitis and heavy alcohol use are often cachectic due to malnutrition. Pancreatic pseudocysts, when large enough, can manifest with a palpable epigastric mass and bilious vomiting (due to extrinsic compression of the distal duodenum) or nonbilious vomiting (due to gastric outlet obstruction). The diagnosis can be confirmed by imaging; a well-defined fluid collection would be seen in the vicinity of the pancreas.","bool":true},{"option":"Chronic cholecystitis","explanation":"\nChronic cholecystitis is the consequence of recurrent acute cholecystitis. Recurrent episodes of acute cholecystitis, which manifest with upper abdominal pain and bilious or nonbilious vomiting, could explain this patient's findings.

The rcDNA is converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) primarily by host enzymes in a process that is not entirely understood. The viral cccDNA is then transcribed to mRNA by host RNA polymerase II, after which it enters the cytoplasm and after forming a capsid, is reverse transcribed into new rcDNA genomes. These genomes are either enveloped and packaged as new virions to be released from the cell, or used for further DNA amplification of the virus. HBV differs from retroviruses (e.g., HIV), in that the reverse transcription is a capsid-mediated process.","bool":true},{"option":"Transcription of viral DNA to RNA in the cytoplasm","explanation":"Most viruses with double-stranded DNA require the host-cell RNA polymerase for transcription. Since this enzyme is located in the host cell nucleus, this part of viral replication cycle also typically takes place there. Poxviruses are the only type of DNA virus that code for their own RNA polymerase and can, therefore, execute transcription in the cytoplasm. HBV, which this patient has, is not capable of this.","bool":false},{"option":"Cleavage of gp160 to form envelope glycoprotein","explanation":"Cleavage of gp160 into gp120 and gp41 subunits occurs in the replication cycle of HIV.

This patient's abdominal findings are most likely caused by increased blood flow in which of the following vessels?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Ascites (shifting dullness), edema, jaundice, and dilated veins in the periumbilical region suggest liver cirrhosis. His history of ulcerative colitis makes primary sclerosing cholangitis a likely cause. The dilated periumbilical veins (caput medusae) are formed by portosystemic shunts.","answers":[{"option":"Superior epigastric vein","explanation":"The abdominal wall veins (e.g., inferior epigastric vein, superior epigastric vein) drain into the systemic circulation inferiorly via the iliofemoral system and superiorly via the veins of the thoracic wall and axilla. The umbilical vein drains venous blood from the paraumbilical veins into the portal system. Portal hypertension is associated with an impedance to flow in the hepatic portal venous system. This results in a retrograde flow of blood from the portal vein via the umbilical vein into the epigastric veins so that blood can be shunted into systemic circulation (portocaval anastomoses). This shunting of blood causes the paraumbilical abdominal wall veins to dilate, resulting in caput medusae. Other manifestations of portocaval shunting include esophageal varices (shunting between the left gastric vein and esophageal veins) and rectal varices (shunting between the superior rectal vein and middle or inferior rectal veins).\nIn patients with cirrhosis, ascites is partly caused by the increased hydrostatic pressures present in portal hypertension. Impaired hepatic protein synthesis (especially albumin) also leads to reduced intravascular oncotic pressure that exacerbates ascites. Additionally, splanchnic vasodilation in patients with cirrhosis results in underfilling of the systemic arterial system, which activates the RAAS. Activation of RAAS leads to Na+ and water retention, which aggravates ascites and peripheral edema.","bool":true},{"option":"Left gastric vein","explanation":"Increased flow in the left gastric vein is not responsible for this patient's abdominal findings.

X-ray of the abdomen shows megacolon with an area of distal narrowing. These findings are highly suggestive of Hirschsprung disease.","answers":[{"option":"Impaired migration of neural crest cells","explanation":"\nImpaired migration of neural crest cells is the underlying cause of Hirschsprung disease. Parasympathetic neural crest cells migrate in a rostral to caudal direction, from the foregut to the midgut to the hindgut. Failure of the neural crest cells to complete this migration typically results in an aganglionic distal sigmoid and rectum (i.e., without the myenteric and submucosal plexus). As a result, there is hypertonicity in the walls of the rectum and sigmoid, and the internal anal sphincter fails to relax in response to rectal distention. The net effect is intestinal obstruction and dilation of the colon (megacolon). The diagnosis is confirmed via rectal biopsy, which would show aganglionosis, increased acetylcholinesterase activity, and/or hyperplasia of parasympathetic fibers.","bool":true},{"option":"Failure to restore patency to fetal duodenum","explanation":"Failure to restore patency to fetal duodenum results in duodenal atresia, which would also present with bilious vomiting and delayed passage of meconium. However, abdominal distention is typically not as prominent, and symptoms are usually evident on the first day after birth with the initiation of feeds. Additionally, the prenatal period is often complicated by polyhydramnios, and an x-ray of the abdomen would show a double bubble sign and absence of gas in the small and large intestine.","bool":false},{"option":"Jejunal vascular accident in utero","explanation":"Disruption of blood flow to the fetal jejunum is responsible for jejunal atresia, which can also present with bilious vomiting, abdominal distention, and delayed passage of meconium. However, symptoms usually appear in feeding infants within 24 hours of birth, and x-ray of the abdomen would show a triple bubble sign.","bool":false},{"option":"Mutation in the CFTR gene","explanation":"A mutation in the CFTR gene is the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, which may result in abdominal distention and bilious vomiting due to intestinal obstruction caused by thickened, inspissated meconium within the distal ileum (meconium ileus). However, x-ray in meconium ileus would typically show small bowel distention or a soap-bubble appearance (Neuhauser sign) rather than the distention of the descending colon seen here. A meconium plug in the rectum (meconium plug syndrome), which is seen with increased frequency in patients with cystic fibrosis, may manifest with distention of the descending colon and symptoms of functional intestinal obstruction. However, the sigmoid colon would usually be distended (unlike the narrow-caliber sigmoid colon seen here, and inspissated meconium would be palpable in the rectal cavity on digital examination.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter","explanation":"\nHypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which is more common in males, may result in vomiting in the neonatal period. However, the vomiting is nonbilious, projectile, occurs following feeds, and usually begins 3–6 weeks after birth. An x-ray of the abdomen would show a distended stomach with minimal distention of the bowels. Other clinical features include decreased soiling of diapers (due to decreased urine output), as well as a hypertrophic “olive” in the epigastric region and/or a gastric peristaltic wave on examination.","bool":false},{"option":"Telescoping of intestinal segment into itself","explanation":"\nIntussusception, or telescoping of the proximal intestinal segment into the distal segment, is more common in males and may result in abdominal distention, bilious vomiting, and dilated bowel loops on x-ray due to intestinal obstruction. However, the small bowel would be distended (not the large bowel), since intussusception typically occurs at the ileocolic junction. Moreover, intussusception usually occurs between 5 months and 3 years of age; it is extremely rare in the neonatal period. Finally, blood in the rectum is often found on digital rectal examination, which was not the case here.","bool":false},{"option":"Incomplete coiling of the intestine","explanation":"\nIntestinal malrotation can manifest within the first month of life with bilious vomiting and abdominal distention due to intestinal obstruction caused by Ladd bands or a midgut volvulus.

Also, patients typically have a history of bloody diarrhea (unlike this neonate, who has delayed passage of meconium), and the child would appear seriously ill with tachypnea and tachycardia. Moreover, this patient lacks the risk factors commonly associated with necrotizing enterocolitis, such as preterm birth and neonatal asphyxia.","bool":false},{"option":"Low serum T4 concentration","explanation":"Low free T4 and high TSH concentrations indicate congenital hypothyroidism, which may in rare cases result in abdominal distention, a delay in passing meconium, bilious vomiting, and dilated bowel loops due to an adynamic ileus (pseudo-obstruction).

HHs are most common in women between the ages of 30–50 years and may enlarge in response to elevated estrogen levels (e.g., due to pregnancy, hormonal therapy). Most HHs are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally on imaging. Because the tumor is highly vascular, biopsy carries a high risk of severe hemorrhage in patients with HHs and is not recommended unless the diagnosis is uncertain.","bool":true},{"option":"Anaphylactic shock","explanation":"\nBiopsy of a hepatic hydatid cyst can result in anaphylaxis due to the release of the highly antigenic hydatid fluid. In an unruptured cyst, the echinococcal antigens evade the host's immune system; sudden exposure to hydatid fluid triggers a hyperacute immune reaction. Hepatic hydatid cyst can manifest as nonspecific abdominal pain, as seen in this patient, but ultrasonography would typically show a unilocular, anechoic, well-defined cyst with internal septa (spoke-wheel pattern), usually with daughter cysts floating within. Furthermore, this patient does not have any stated risk factors for Echinococcus infection (e.g., ingestion of contaminated food, travel to endemic region).","bool":false},{"option":"Metastatic spread","explanation":"\nBiopsy of a malignant hepatic lesion (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma) can seed tumor cells throughout the track of the biopsy needle, risking metastatic spread.

These protrusions are pseudodiverticula because not all layers of the intestinal wall are affected. Diverticulosis is the presence of these protrusions (identified as air-filled pouches on CT). Risk factors for diverticulosis include a low-fiber diet and smoking. The prevalence of diverticulosis also increases with age, which is thought to be because of structural changes in collagen associated with aging. Patients with connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan syndrome, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease may present with diverticula prematurely because they develop these structural changes earlier in life.\nDiverticulitis, which is an inflammation of one or more of these protrusions, typically manifests with fever, left-sided lower abdominal pain, change in bowel habits (e.g., diarrhea), and bowel wall thickening on CT scan. Affected individuals may also have a tender, palpable mass if there is a peridiverticular abscess.","bool":true},{"option":"Thrombosis of the inferior mesenteric vein","explanation":"\nThrombosis of the inferior mesenteric vein can lead to acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI), which may manifest with abdominal pain and diarrhea.

Fever and leukocytes in stool would also not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Reheated rice","explanation":"Reheated rice is commonly associated with infection with Bacillus cereus, which produces two different enterotoxins that can cause two distinct food poisoning syndromes: the emetic form and the diarrheal form. The emetic form is the one most commonly associated with reheated rice and manifests predominantly with nausea and vomiting rather than diarrhea. The diarrheal form is associated with a broad range of improperly refrigerated food (e.g., meat, vegetables) and typically manifests with watery rather than inflammatory diarrhea.","bool":false},{"option":"Home-canned vegetables","explanation":"Improperly canned foods are often the source of Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic, gram-positive rod that forms spores and produces a heat-labile neurotoxin. Ingestion of the toxin may cause gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting), but it would also not cause inflammatory diarrhea. Instead, dramatic neurological impairment that includes descending paralysis, dysarthria, dysphagia, and diplopia would be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Toxic mushrooms","explanation":"Several mushrooms cause symptoms in humans when ingested and some, like Amanita phalloides, are potentially lethal. A. phalloides produces a toxin that blocks RNA polymerase, which inhibits transcription and protein synthesis, leading to apoptosis. Patients typically present with gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps) 12 hours after ingestion and subsequently develop toxic renal and liver failure after 3–10 days. However, this patient has no signs of organ damage, presenting instead with fever, bloody diarrhea, and leukocytes in the stool, which is indicative of inflammatory diarrhea caused by direct interaction between bacteria and mucosal lining.","bool":false}]},{"id":202,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 57-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fatigue and palpitations for several weeks. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography shows thrombus formation in the left atrium. Which of the following organs is most likely to continue to function in the case of an embolic event?","difficulty":2,"hint":"In the case of arterial emboli, most organs will infarct and cease to function. However, a dual blood supply may allow tissue to remain oxygenated and preserve function.","answers":[{"option":"Liver","explanation":"The liver benefits from dual blood supply. The hepatic portal vein supplies ∼ 75% of the liver's blood, and the hepatic artery proper contributes the rest. The hepatic portal vein carries venous blood from the spleen and lower gastrointestinal tract, while the hepatic arteries are branches of the common hepatic artery arising from the celiac trunk. Oxygen is provided from both sources with about half of the liver's oxygen demand met by the hepatic portal vein. The dual blood and oxygen supply protects the liver against potential infarct.","bool":true},{"option":"Brain","explanation":"The central nervous system is especially vulnerable to ischemia, from embolic occlusion or otherwise. This is due to its high metabolic rate and glucose consumption. In total, ∼ 80% of embolism-related deaths in atrial fibrillation are from stroke.","bool":false},{"option":"Kidney","explanation":"Each kidney has a single blood supply (e.g., respective renal artery). This makes the kidneys more susceptible to infarction than an organ with dual blood supply, particularly in the straight portion of the proximal convoluted tubule and ascending loop of Henle (due to their high energy demand and proximity to the corticomedullary junction, which has low blood flow). While A-fib is associated with a low incidence (0.01%) of renal thromboembolism, 25% of patients who experienced an event had persistent renal failure.","bool":false},{"option":"Spleen","explanation":"The spleen primarily receives blood via the splenic artery. Though splenic emboli are rare and usually quiescent clinically, the spleen is more susceptible to infarction and loss of function from emboli than an organ with dual blood supply.","bool":false},{"option":"Colon","explanation":"While thrombosis in the bowel is usually less acute due to collateral circulation, embolic obstruction of the superior or inferior mesenteric arteries can still cause acute ischemia of the colon, particularly in watershed areas.

A diagnosis of LI is then confirmed using a validated symptom questionnaire and if symptoms subside within 5–7 days without consumption of lactose-containing products. A hydrogen breath test can also be used in the diagnostic workup; this test is considered positive if breath hydrogen levels increase to &gt; 20 ppm following the ingestion of a lactose-loaded drink. Other conditions with a similar manifestation (celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteritis, other food intolerances) should be considered in patients with severe gastrointestinal symptoms or in those who show no improvement despite a lactose-free diet.

Which of the following would have been most likely to prevent this patient's weight loss?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient has xeroderma and keratin deposits on the conjunctivae (Bitot spots), which are features suggestive of vitamin A deficiency. The physiologic increase in D-xylose excretion seen in this patient indicates that the integrity of the intestinal mucosa is intact.","answers":[{"option":"Pancreatic enzyme replacement","explanation":"This patient's hard, immobile neck mass in the anterior midline is suggestive of Riedel thyroiditis, which is associated with other IgG4-related systemic diseases. Vitamin A deficiency along with her weight loss, diarrhea, and physiologic increase in urinary D-xylose excretion indicate exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, most likely due to autoimmune pancreatitis. Pancreatic enzyme replacement would be the preventative treatment.\nBecause absorption of D-xylose in the intestine does not rely on the breakdown by pancreatic enzymes, a normal increase in urinary D-xylose excretion indicates a healthy intestinal mucosa. In conditions associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, oral administration of D-xylose will result in increased fecal D-xylose excretion.","bool":true},{"option":"Gluten-free diet","explanation":"A gluten-free diet is the treatment of celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder involving hypersensitivity to gliadin in gluten. Celiac disease can also present with weight loss, diarrhea, bloating, and cutaneous manifestations, as in this patient. However, instead of xeroderma, skin manifestations include papules and vesicles on the extensor surfaces (dermatitis herpetiformis).

Histologic examination of the lesions is most likely to show which of the following findings?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This HIV-positive patient with a very low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (&lt; 200/mm3) presents with HHV-8-positive lesions, making Kaposi sarcoma the most likely diagnosis.","answers":[{"option":"Spindle-shaped cells with lymphocytic infiltration","explanation":"\nVascular lesions showing spindle-shaped cells with lymphocytic infiltration are consistent with Kaposi sarcoma, an AIDS-defining condition that is caused by HHV-8 infection. Kaposi sarcomas originate from endothelial cells and usually manifest with asymptomatic vascular tumors of the skin. These tumors can also involve the lymph nodes and gastrointestinal tract, potentially causing diarrhea and abdominal pain. Additional histologic features of Kaposi sarcoma include slit-like vascular spaces and extravasated erythrocytes.\nKaposi sarcoma of the skin appears similar to bacillary angiomatosis, which can also occur in HIV patients. However, bacillary angiomatosis is caused by Bartonella species, not HHV-8, and a skin biopsy of bacillary angiomatosis shows a neutrophilic rather than a lymphocytic infiltrate.","bool":true},{"option":"Polygonal cells with racket-shaped organelles","explanation":"Polygonal cells with tennis racket-shaped organelles describe Birbeck granules, which are seen in Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Unlike this patient's condition, Langerhans cell histiocytosis rarely involves the gastrointestinal tract.

Patients with CMV colitis can present with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. However, endoscopy of CMV colitis usually shows linear ulcers rather than the hemorrhagic nodules seen in this patient. Furthermore, CMV infections (e.g., colitis, retinitis, esophagitis) in patients with HIV typically present when the CD4+ count is &lt; 50 cells/mm3 and would be unlikely in this patient with a CD4+ count of 180/mm3.","bool":false}]},{"id":206,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of anal pain that occurs during defecation and lasts for several hours.

The etiology is usually benign and primary in nature, with the most common cause being local trauma (e.g., passing of hard stools due to constipation), persistent diarrhea, vaginal delivery, or anal sex. This predilection for the posterior midline is likely due to poor perfusion to this area. Often, a skin tag (sentinel pile) formed by hypertrophied papillae would be visible in the perianal region at the site of the fissure.","bool":true},{"option":"Anterior midline of the anal canal, distal to the pectinate line","explanation":"Only 10% of anal fissures occur at the anterior midline of the anal canal, distal to the pectinate line.

Serum studies show increased levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen. Which of the following is the most likely additional laboratory finding?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This newborn's inability to pass her first stool (most likely caused by meconium ileus) and increased serum immunoreactive trypsinogen are indicative of cystic fibrosis as the underlying disease.","answers":[{"option":"Increased sodium concentration in sweat","explanation":"Increased sodium concentration in sweat is a result of impaired chloride ion transport; chloride transport is mediated by the CFTR channel and the gene for this channel is mutated in cystic fibrosis. In the most common CFTR gene mutation, the membrane transporter misfolds, causing it to be retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, chloride is not properly reabsorbed and remains in the lumen of the apocrine sweat gland. Positively charged sodium ions are also pathologically trapped in sweat by the negatively charged chloride ions in order to balance the net electric charge, resulting in hypertonic sweat.\nLevels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) are measured as part of neonatal screening for cystic fibrosis. Elevated levels of IRT in heel-prick blood indicate that it has not been converted to its active form (trypsin), as a result of impaired release of pancreatic enzymes.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased chloride concentration in alveolar fluid","explanation":"Increased chloride concentration in alveolar fluid is not expected in cases of cystic fibrosis. Chloride concentration in the alveolar fluid is established through the action of CFTR channels, which actively transport chloride ions into the alveoli. A defect of the CFTR protein in cystic fibrosis impairs the transport of chloride ions into the alveoli and leads to a decrease (not an increase) in alveolar chloride concentration. As a result of the diminished chloride transport, water molecules are not secreted and the resulting mucus is hyperviscous, leading to mucus plug formation.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased bicarbonate concentration in pancreatic secretions","explanation":"An increase in bicarbonate concentration in pancreatic secretions occurs as a normal response to food intake; it would not be expected in cystic fibrosis. The defective CFTR protein in cystic fibrosis impairs the secretion of chloride, sodium, and bicarbonate ions from the pancreas, decreasing the water content of pancreatic secretions. In newborns with cystic fibrosis, decreased water content of pancreatic secretions contributes to the development of recalcitrant meconium. As patients with this condition age, the hyperviscous pancreatic secretions lead to sclerosis of the pancreatic ducts and, ultimately, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased hydrogen ion concentration in renal collecting duct","explanation":"Decreased hydrogen ion concentration in the renal collecting duct would not be expected in this patient. As a result of this neonate's vomiting, she is most likely hypovolemic with a contraction alkalosis. In cases of contraction alkalosis, aldosterone acts on the distal tubule to increase secretion of hydrogen and potassium ions in exchange for increased reabsorption of sodium ions. Therefore, she would be expected to have an increased, not decreased hydrogen ion concentration. Cystic fibrosis itself does not affect renal electrolyte concentrations because the CFTR protein is not expressed in the kidneys.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased serum calcium concentration","explanation":"\nIncreased serum calcium concentration is not expected in cystic fibrosis. Instead, patients with (advanced) cystic fibrosis often present with signs and symptoms of malabsorption, including impaired absorption of vitamin D. Because vitamin D is essential for renal and intestinal reabsorption of calcium, vitamin D deficiency results in decreased serum calcium concentrations.

Norovirus is transmitted fecal‑orally; the patient might have contracted the illness from consuming contaminated food or water or from contact with contaminated surfaces. Person-to-person or airborne-droplet transmission is also possible. Because the virus is highly virulent, infected individuals are highly contagious during the acute phase and up to 72 hours following the onset of symptoms.\nDiagnosis of a suspected norovirus infection should be confirmed with reverse transcription PCR to determine isolation measures and whether the condition needs to be reported. Treatment is supportive because symptoms typically resolve spontaneously within 48–72 hours.","bool":true},{"option":"Salmonella enteritidis","explanation":"\nSalmonella enteritidis can invade the intestinal mucosa in infected individuals and cause salmonellosis, which may also manifest with watery stools, nausea, and vomiting after an incubation period of about 6–48 hours. However, salmonellosis is usually associated with high-grade fever and inflammatory (watery-bloody) diarrhea, which are absent in this patient. Because S. enteritidis is typically transmitted via ingestion of poultry, poorly pasteurized eggs, and milk, infection with this organism is unlikely in this vegan patient who does not consume animal products.","bool":false},{"option":"Rotavirus","explanation":"While rotavirus gastroenteritis may also manifest with vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise after an incubation period of 1–3 days, it is usually associated with fever, more severe watery diarrhea (&gt; 10 watery stools within 24 hours), and dehydration.

Constipation can be a precipitating factor for HE.","answers":[{"option":"Administer lactulose","explanation":"In addition to supportive care and correction of precipitating causes, the first-line treatment for acute HE consists of lactulose because of its efficacy, availability, and relatively low cost. Lactulose improves HE by decreasing the absorption of ammonia in the bowel. This effect occurs via multiple mechanisms, including a laxative effect that may help resolve constipation (a trigger for HE, as seen in this patient), reduction of the pH in the lumen of the bowel, which decreases the amount of ammonia absorbed into the plasma, and displacement of ammonia-producing bacteria. Rifaximin is used as a second-line or adjunct treatment for HE that has not improved after 48 hours on first-line therapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Administer IV ceftriaxone","explanation":"In a cirrhotic patient, ceftriaxone would be the appropriate treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which may manifest clinically with abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and fever.

The pain is dull, nonradiating, worse after eating, and occasionally associated with bloating and diarrhea. His symptoms have not improved despite 4 weeks of treatment with omeprazole. He attributes his weight loss to recently eating very small portions and avoiding fatty foods. He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft operation for coronary artery disease 8 years ago. Current medications include lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and aspirin. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years and drinks 1–2 beers daily. His pulse is 79/min and blood pressure is 138/89 mm Hg.

In CMI, segments of the splanchnic circulation are stenosed due to atherosclerosis. These segments inhibit the normal postprandial increase in splanchnic circulation that is required for digestion, resulting in postprandial pain (intestinal angina), as seen here. Patients with CMI often develop an aversion to certain foods that trigger the pain (food fear) and lose weight. An abdominal bruit may be auscultated in some patients with CMI due to turbulent blood flow through the stenosed arterial segment. This patient has many risk factors for CMI, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic smoking, and coronary artery disease. As there is a high index of suspicion for CMI in this patient, a CT angiography is most likely to confirm the diagnosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Colonoscopy","explanation":"\nColonoscopy is the preferred diagnostic test when a colonic disease (e.g., colon cancer, diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel diseases) is suspected. Colonic pathologies typically cause colicky abdominal pain that is unrelated to food intake and is associated with a significant alteration in bowel habits. This patient's upper abdominal pain, which becomes worse after meals, and occasional diarrhea is more consistent with an upper gastrointestinal pathology.","bool":false},{"option":"Right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound","explanation":"\nRight upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic test for gallbladder diseases. Symptomatic cholelithiasis can manifest with intermittent postprandial upper abdominal pain (biliary colic) that is not relieved with acid suppression therapy. However, as biliary colic does not typically occur after each meal, patients do not develop food aversion or lose weight. Gallbladder malignancy can manifest with significant weight loss and can be detected on a RUQ ultrasound, but it typically does not cause postprandial abdominal pain.","bool":false},{"option":"Urea breath test","explanation":"\nUrea breath test is a noninvasive method of confirming a diagnosis of H. pylori infection in patients with suspected peptic ulcer disease (PUD). PUD can manifest with postprandial epigastric pain, food aversion, and weight loss, and may also be resistant to PPI treatment in severe cases. However, a urea breath test is only indicated in patients &lt; 60 years without the presence of alarm symptoms. In addition, this patient's history of cardiovascular disease, coronary artery bypass surgery, and smoking makes another diagnosis more likely.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient's bilirubinuria suggests an underlying conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, as unconjugated bilirubin is tightly bound to albumin and cannot be filtered and excreted in the urine.","answers":[{"option":"Defective hepatic bile excretion","explanation":"Normally, unconjugated bilirubin is absorbed by the liver and conjugated with glucuronic acid. It is then secreted via the bile and converted to urobilinogen by intestinal bacteria. In cases of defective hepatic bile excretion (i.e., due to a bile duct stenosis or choledocholithiasis), conjugation continues to take place (i.e., unconjugated bilirubin concentration remains normal) but conjugated bilirubin cannot be secreted. Conjugated bilirubin accumulates in the blood (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia) and is excreted by the kidneys (increased bilirubin in urinalysis).","bool":true},{"option":"Increased hemoglobin breakdown","explanation":"\nHemolysis can also cause jaundice and pruritus, which are seen here. In hemolysis, destruction of RBCs leads to excess unconjugated bilirubin in the serum and other laboratory signs of hemolysis, as well as increased excretion of conjugated bilirubin by the intestines. Urinalysis would be expected to show increased urobilinogen (due to increased conversion from conjugated bilirubin to urobilinogen in the gut, intestinal reabsorption, and renal excretion) and normal bilirubin, unlike with this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity","explanation":"Decreased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is seen in Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome. While affected patients may present with jaundice and pruritus, bilirubin would not be detected in the urine. Moreover, the relatively acute course of this patient's symptoms makes this unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption","explanation":"Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption would result in increased levels of conjugated bilirubin (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia). While this excess of bilirubin can lead to acute jaundice and pruritus, urinalysis would show both increased bilirubin and urobilinogen excretion. This patient's urinalysis shows a low concentration of urobilinogen, which implies his conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is due to a different cause.","bool":false},{"option":"Malignant growth in the pancreatic body","explanation":"\nPancreatic head tumors commonly present with jaundice, given their proximity to the biliary tree and subsequent potential for biliary duct obstruction. However, pancreatic body tumors are uncommon and much less likely to affect the liver or cause bile duct obstruction. This pathology is therefore an unlikely cause of this patient's features.","bool":false},{"option":"Presence of stones within the gallbladder","explanation":"\nGallstones located in the gallbladder do not lead to hyperbilirubinemia.

Iron deficiency, in turn, can lead to microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Treatment of iron deficiency anemia following duodenal resection consists of intravenous iron supplementation.","bool":true},{"option":"Calcium oxalate kidney stones","explanation":"\nCalcium absorption is mediated through active transport and passive diffusion with the greatest amount being absorbed in the duodenum. When this patient's duodenum is removed, she will have diminished intestinal calcium uptake, which leads to increased reabsorption of calcium in the kidney to maintain normal serum levels. As a result, urinary calcium is low, which decreases the likelihood of calcium oxalate stone formation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","bool":false},{"option":"Wide-based gait","explanation":"The finding of wide-based gait is commonly associated with long-standing vitamin B12 deficiency, which leads to diminished proprioception in the lower extremities. Common causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include pernicious anemia, malnutrition, or gastrectomy. Whipple procedure does not alter vitamin B12 absorption as this vitamin is absorbed in the terminal ileum. Moreover, the function of intrinsic factor (IF), which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12, is also unaffected following this procedure since IF is produced in the gastric cardia and fundus rather than the distal stomach.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased bile production","explanation":"\nBile acids play a pivotal role in the metabolism of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins as well as cholesterol excretion. Bile excretion into the duodenum is stimulated by food intake, which is followed by reabsorption of up to 95% of bile acids in the ileum, not the duodenum. This cycle is known as enterohepatic circulation. Thus, bile synthesis remains unaffected by pancreaticoduodenectomy.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypercoagulable state","explanation":"A hypercoagulable state may either result from inherited gene mutations or insufficient inhibitors of the coagulation cascade, neither of which this patient has. However, Whipple procedure involves resection of the proximal part of the jejunum, which is responsible for the absorption of vitamin K, and it may therefore lead to coagulopathy and increased bleeding risk due to a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.","bool":false}]},{"id":220,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"\nA 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after a suicide attempt.

If serum acetaminophen levels are above a defined treatment line, N-acetylcysteine should be administered. Acetaminophen toxicity is often asymptomatic in the first 24 hours after ingestion; however, it may manifest with nausea, vomiting, and lethargy.

However, as Boerhaave syndrome is a transmural rupture of the esophagus, patients classically present with mediastinal crepitus on exam, and a crunching heard over the precordium as the heart beats against air-filled tissues (Hamman's sign). Furthermore, Boerhaave syndrome would not account for this patient’s elevated serum amylase and lipase levels.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute mesenteric ischemia","explanation":"\nAcute mesenteric ischemia typically manifests in older patients with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as in this patient. It can also cause acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and hemodynamic instability. However, abdominal pain is often out of proportion to examination findings rather than patients exhibiting guarding and tenderness. Furthermore, this patient has no additional risk factors for thromboembolism such as atrial fibrillation, and mesenteric ischemia would manifest with an elevated lactate and LDH rather than elevated lipase and amylase.","bool":false},{"option":"Peptic ulcer disease","explanation":"\nPeptic ulcer disease (PUD) can also present with epigastric pain and nausea. Smoking and alcohol are risk factors for PUD. However, the onset of symptoms would likely be less acute than in this patient and the pain does not typically radiate to the back.

Halothane hepatitis commonly leads to elevated serum aminotransferases, elevated bilirubin, eosinophilia, and slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase, as seen in this patient. This patient's symptoms began 13 days following surgery, which is consistent with the timeframe for postoperative onset of halothane hepatitis (2 days to 3 weeks). Liver biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis but typically shows massive centrilobular hepatic necrosis.\nHalothane is not commonly used as an anesthetic in the United States (and most other industrialized countries) because of its side effects. Instead, it has been replaced with other inhalational anesthetics, such as desflurane, sevoflurane, or isoflurane. However, halothane is still frequently used in developing countries because it is less expensive than other substances.","bool":true},{"option":"Trauma to the bile duct","explanation":"Trauma to the bile duct is a common complication of upper-abdominal surgery, especially cholecystectomy, and can manifest with acute hepatitis, which is seen in this patient. Subsequent scarring of the bile duct may lead to stricture formation, which in turn causes cholestasis. However, this complication is rare after appendectomy. Moreover, liver biopsy would show intraparenchymal cholestasis (not centrilobular necrosis), manifesting as bile pigment accumulation.","bool":false},{"option":"Excessive lysis of red blood cells","explanation":"Excessive lysis of red blood cells can occur postoperatively due to hemolytic transfusion reactions. This patient's transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells during surgery may have caused a hemolytic transfusion reaction.

Examination shows yellow discoloration of the sclera. Abdominal examination shows a nontender, enlarged gallbladder. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a total bilirubin of 9.8 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 8.6 mg/dL, and an alkaline phosphatase of 560 IU/L.

A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT is the investigation of choice to confirm pancreatic carcinoma and determine its resectability. On contrast CT, a pancreatic carcinoma typically appears as an ill-defined, hypodense mass (because it is poorly vascularized). If abdominal CT is inconclusive or shows a borderline resectable or unresectable tumor, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and EUS-guided biopsy should be performed to histologically confirm the diagnosis. If metastases are absent and the tumor is resectable, surgical resection should be performed (e.g., Whipple procedure for pancreatic head tumors), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Borderline resectable tumors are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by resection. Most often, though, metastases are discovered and/or the tumor is unresectable. Such patients are typically treated palliatively or can join a clinical trial.\nThis question is especially challenging because the patient's presentation resembles gallstone disease, which can also cause epigastric pain, obstructive jaundice, and dilation of both the biliary and pancreatic ducts if the stone is located near the ampulla of Vater. Also, such a stone may not be evident on ultrasound because ultrasonographic visualization of the most distal portions of the biliary tree is often not feasible. However, it is important to keep in mind that patients with gallstone disease will invariably have one or more of the following features on ultrasonography (especially in an exam question): thickening of walls of the biliary tree or gallbladder, pericystic fluid accumulation, scarring or shrinking of the gallbladder, and/or biliary sludge. Additionally, the epigastric pain is often worse after meals and does not radiate to the back. Lastly, Courvoisier sign usually makes gallstones an unlikely cause of biliary obstruction.","bool":true},{"option":"Colonoscopy","explanation":"\nColonoscopy is used to diagnose colon cancer, which would cause weight loss and abdominal pain. Smoking is a risk factor for colon cancer, and obstructive jaundice can occur in patients with liver metastasis.

Instead, evidence of liver metastases would be present on abdominal ultrasound.","bool":false},{"option":"Plain abdominal CT","explanation":"\nPancreatic carcinoma is typically ill-defined and often has the same tissue density as the surrounding normal pancreatic tissue. Plain abdominal CT scans, therefore, have poor sensitivity and specificity for pancreatic carcinoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","explanation":"Although ERCP is not the most appropriate next step for this case, this was a good option to consider for two reasons:\n• First, duct brushing cytology performed during ERCP has a high sensitivity for pancreatic head tumors and was performed in the past to confirm the diagnosis. However, ERCP is invasive and cannot define the extent of the tumor, which is important for determining its resectability. ERCP is therefore no longer performed in the initial diagnostic workup of pancreatic carcinoma.\n• Second, after ultrasonography, some centers perform ERCP as the next step without obtaining any additional imaging if gallstone disease is suspected to be the underlying cause of biliary tract obstruction because the procedure is simultaneously diagnostic and therapeutic. Gallstone disease can cause epigastric pain, obstructive jaundice, and dilation of both the biliary and pancreatic ducts if the stone is located near the ampulla of Vater.

Following treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole, patients should also receive an intraluminal amebicide (e.g., paromomycin) to eradicate intestinal cysts and prevent relapse.\nIn travelers with asymptomatic infection, treatment with luminal agents is usually sufficient. Individuals from endemic areas with asymptomatic infection do not require treatment.","bool":true},{"option":"Serological tests","explanation":"Serological tests are useful in the diagnosis of certain infections. In the case of amebiasis, seroconversion occurs in up to 90% of patients with intestinal amebiasis and up to 99% of patients with an amebic liver abscess. However, serology cannot differentiate between a past and newly acquired infection. This test is not useful in this patient because the diagnosis of intestinal amebiasis has already been confirmed by stool analysis. Serology may be used in the diagnosis of extraintestinal amebiasis (e.g., amebic liver disease), especially when stool microscopy is negative. However, the patient does not have symptoms suggestive of amebic liver disease such as right upper quadrant pain.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Abdominal ultrasound of the right upper quadrant","explanation":"An amebic liver abscess occurs in about 5% of patients with intestinal amebiasis, and abdominal ultrasound typically shows a hypoechoic cystic lesion. This patient currently has no features that suggest amebic liver abscess (e.g., right upper quadrant pain) and, therefore, further evaluation with abdominal ultrasound is not indicated at this time. Moreover, an abscess usually takes months to years to develop after the initial intestinal infection; this patient's travel history suggests a recent infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Praziquantel","explanation":"\nPraziquantel is used to treat most trematode infections (e.g., schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis) and certain cestode infections (e.g., taeniasis). Intestinal taeniasis, clonorchiasis, and certain forms of schistosomiasis (Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni) are diagnosed by the presence of eggs in feces. However, the finding of hematophagous trophozoites in stool indicates that the patient has amebiasis, a protozoal disease for which praziquantel is ineffective.","bool":false},{"option":"Stop iron supplements","explanation":"\nIron supplementation can result in dark stools, which may be mistaken for melena. Melena (black, tarry stools) occurs as a result of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Since this patient has stools that are blood-tinged rather than tar-like, the site of blood loss is most likely the lower GI tract. Although this patient should be cautious using iron supplementation, stopping supplements will neither eliminate the blood-tinged stools nor treat amebiasis.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Doxycycline","explanation":"\nDoxycycline is the treatment of choice for diarrhea due to cholera. However, patients with cholera have frequent, voluminous “rice water” stools, are often severely dehydrated, and are usually febrile.

Pregnancy was uncomplicated and the mother received adequate prenatal care. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 132/min, and respirations are 50/min. Examination shows a distended abdomen. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Digital rectal examination shows increased anal sphincter tone and an empty rectal vault. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the underlying cause of these findings?\n\n\n\n\n","difficulty":2,"hint":"Abdominal distention, multiple episodes of bilious vomiting, and a dilated large bowel loop suggest lower intestinal obstruction. The delayed passage of meconium, absence of air in the rectum, and a narrow sigmoid colon with a dilated segment on x-ray support the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. This disease commonly manifests with squirt sign, although it is not seen in this newborn patient who has an empty rectal vault.","answers":[{"option":"Defective migration of neural crest cells","explanation":"\nDefective migration of neural crest cells from the proximal to the distal bowel is the underlying mechanism of Hirschsprung disease. This phenomenon typically results in an aganglionic rectum and distal sigmoid, which prevents the internal anal sphincter from relaxing in response to rectal distension, leading to intestinal obstruction and megacolon. The diagnosis is confirmed with a rectal biopsy, which usually shows aganglionosis and/or hypertrophy of parasympathetic fibers.\nSee “Differential diagnosis of intestinal obstruction in neonates” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Failed recanalization of the fetal duodenum","explanation":"Failed recanalization of the fetal duodenum results in duodenal atresia, which would also manifest with bilious vomiting and delayed meconium passage. However, abdominal distention is typically not as prominent, and symptoms are usually evident on the first day after birth with the initiation of feeds. Additionally, the prenatal period is often complicated by polyhydramnios, and an x-ray of the abdomen would show a double bubble sign and absence of gas in the small and large intestine.","bool":false},{"option":"Disruption of blood flow to the fetal jejunum","explanation":"Disruption of blood flow to the fetal jejunum is responsible for jejunal atresia, which can also manifest with bilious vomiting, abdominal distention, and delayed meconium passage. However, symptoms usually appear in feeding infants within 24 hours of birth and an x-ray of the abdomen would show a triple bubble sign.","bool":false},{"option":"Mutation in the CFTR gene","explanation":"A mutation in the CFTR gene is the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, which may result in abdominal distention and bilious vomiting due to intestinal obstruction as a result of thickened, inspissated meconium within the distal ileum (meconium ileus). However, although delayed (3 days after delivery), this patient already passed meconium, and bowel sounds would typically be hyperactive in mechanical bowel obstruction. Furthermore, an x-ray in meconium ileus would typically show small bowel distention or a soap-bubble appearance (Neuhauser sign), rather than a distended descending colon, as seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter","explanation":"\nHypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which is more common in males, may result in vomiting in the neonatal period. However, the vomiting is nonbilious, projectile, occurs following feeds, and usually begins 2 weeks after birth. An x-ray of the abdomen would show a distended stomach with minimal distention of the bowels. Other clinical features include decreased soiling of diapers (due to decreased urine output), as well as a hypertrophic “olive” in the epigastric region and/or a gastric peristaltic wave on examination.","bool":false},{"option":"Invagination of bowel loop into adjacent bowel loop","explanation":"\nIntussusception is more common in males and may result in abdominal distention, bilious vomiting, and dilated bowel loops on x-ray due to intestinal obstruction. However, the small bowel would be distended (not the large bowel), since intussusception typically occurs at the ileocolic junction, and bowel sounds would be increased. Moreover, intussusception usually occurs between 5 months and 3 years of age; it is extremely rare in the neonatal period. Finally, blood in the rectum is often found on digital rectal examination, which was not the case here.","bool":false},{"option":"Abnormal rotation of the intestine","explanation":"\nIntestinal malrotation may manifest within the first month of life with bilious vomiting and abdominal distention due to intestinal obstruction caused by Ladd bands or by a midgut volvulus. However, bowel sounds would likely be increased and an x-ray would show a double bubble sign, or multiple air-fluid levels proximal to the site of obstruction, in contrast to the distended descending colon in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Hemmorrhagic inflammation of the intestinal wall","explanation":"Hemorrhagic inflammation of the intestinal wall is seen in necrotizing enterocolitis, which may manifest with abdominal distention and bilious vomiting shortly after birth, However, an x-ray would typically show bowel wall edema, pneumatosis intestinalis, and/or free air within the abdomen (due to perforation of a viscus). Also, patients typically have a history of bloody diarrhea (unlike this neonate, who had delayed meconium passage) and the child would appear seriously ill with tachypnea and tachycardia.

Esophageal injury may result in epigastric pain and hematemesis, both of which this patient is experiencing. Heavy alcohol use is the most important predisposing condition for Mallory-Weiss syndrome.","bool":true},{"option":"Ulcerative damage to the posterior wall of the duodenum","explanation":"Although patients with bleeding from a duodenal ulcer may present with epigastric pain and hematemesis, the bleeding usually occurs spontaneously and is not preceded by multiple episodes of nonbloody vomiting.

However, hematemesis is not characteristic of this condition. In addition, patients with Boerhaave syndrome typically present with excruciating retrosternal chest pain rather than epigastric pain and can develop dyspnea, crepitus on palpation of the chest wall (due to mediastinal emphysema), and signs of mediastinitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Dilated submucosal veins in the lower esophagus","explanation":"\nEsophageal varices are the most common cause of esophageal bleeding. Heavy drinking increases the risk of alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis, which may eventually lead to the formation of esophageal varices and subsequent variceal bleeding. Variceal bleeding usually manifests with sudden onset of hematemesis. However, this patient had multiple episodes of nonbloody vomiting before the bleeding started and has only been vomiting a small amount of blood, whereas variceal bleeding would typically manifest with severe hemorrhage. Because his physical examination did not show any signs of liver disease or portal hypertension, a different diagnosis is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Neoplastic growth at the gastroesophageal junction","explanation":"\nHematemesis and abdominal pain in a patient with a history of heavy alcohol use could be explained by bleeding of a gastric tumor. Gastric cancer often progresses slowly and is associated with constitutional symptoms (e.g., weight loss) and symptoms of upper gastrointestinal malignancy (e.g., prolonged course of abdominal pain, early satiety).

Typical symptoms include painless groin swelling. They manifest as a palpable mass below the inguinal ligament, medial to the femoral vein; an expansive cough impulse is a common finding. In addition to obesity, chronic cough resulting from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increases intraabdominal pressure, consequently increasing the risk of developing a femoral hernia.","bool":true},{"option":"Incomplete obliteration of the processus vaginalis","explanation":"Incomplete obliteration of the processus vaginalis during fetal development is the most common cause of indirect inguinal hernia. Although indirect inguinal hernias can extend below the inguinal ligament into the genital region, inguinal hernias arise above the inguinal ligament, not below as seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Weakness of the transversalis fascia","explanation":"Weakness of the transversalis fascia can lead to the development of a direct inguinal hernia. This weakening is commonly secondary to conditions that increase intraabdominal pressure (e.g., obesity or coughing in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). However, inguinal hernias arise above the inguinal ligament, not below as seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Dilation of the femoral artery","explanation":"Dilation of the femoral artery leads to a femoral artery aneurysm, which can manifest with a painless groin swelling below the inguinal ligament.

The current symptoms of poor feeding and bilious vomiting, physical findings of abdominal distention and explosive stool release upon rectal examination, and the presence of a dilated colonic segment proximal to an empty segment on x-ray further support this diagnosis.","answers":[{"option":"Rectal suction biopsy","explanation":"\nRectal biopsy is the gold standard confirmatory test for suspected HD. It can be performed either as a full-thickness biopsy, carried out under general anesthesia, or as a rectal suction biopsy, directly at the bedside, sparing the patient the need to undergo general anesthesia. If the biopsy shows an absence of ganglion cells in an adequate tissue sample, HD is confirmed. A normal biopsy result taken from a correct site (i.e., 2 cm proximal to the dentate line) virtually rules out HD.\nIf HD is confirmed, the aganglionic segment of the colon is resected and anastomosed, either in a one-stage operation or, less commonly, as a two-stage surgery in which a diverting colostomy is performed to decompress the dilated bowel, followed by definitive anastomosis of the bowel loops.","bool":true},{"option":"Anorectal manometry","explanation":"\nAnorectal manometry is a useful screening test in children &gt; 1 month of age with suspected HD. However, because the developing anorectal sphincter does not reach a stable resting pressure until approx. 1 month of age, anorectal manometry is not the best diagnostic test for this 3-week-old patient.

A gallstone that has become lodged in the common bile duct (CBD) can cause colicky pain and biliary obstruction. Patients with choledocholithiasis develop dark urine and pale stool because bilirubin cannot pass through the occluded biliary tract into the intestine, and is excreted with the urine instead. However, these changes are not always apparent in early stage biliary obstruction (e.g., acholic stool may not have passed through the bowel yet). CBD dilation is used as a proxy for suspected obstruction because CBD stones are rarely seen on ultrasound. This patient should undergo an ERCP to confirm the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and remove the stone. Otherwise, she is at risk of developing ascending cholangitis or biliary pancreatitis (if the stone becomes stuck in the ampulla of Vater and obstructs the pancreatic duct). Also, this patient should undergo gallbladder removal to prevent any future passing of stones.","bool":true},{"option":"Cholecystitis","explanation":"This patient's colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may be consistent with cholecystitis. The gallstones in her gallbladder put her at risk of developing this complication. However, the patient does not show any signs of infection (e.g., fever, leukocytosis), which would typically be present in cholecystitis. Also, neither a thickened gallbladder wall nor pericholecystic fluid are seen on ultrasound, and these are often (but not always) seen in cholecystitis. Also, cholecystitis would not account for this patient's elevated bilirubin level and dilated common bile duct.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute cholangitis","explanation":"The patient's right upper quadrant pain and jaundice may be consistent with acute cholangitis. She has gallstones, which put her at risk of developing cholangitis. But she lacks signs of infection, such as fever and leukocytosis, making acute cholangitis unlikely. Her current condition does, however, put her at risk of developing acute cholangitis as a complication in the future.","bool":false},{"option":"Pancreatitis","explanation":"\nPain caused by pancreatitis is usually constant, severe, epigastric, and typically radiates to the back. This patient's colicky right upper quadrant pain would be atypical of pancreatitis and makes this diagnosis less likely.

Although some studies suggest an increased risk of colorectal cancer in hemochromatosis, this association is not well established and other complications are more likely to occur.","bool":false},{"option":"Parkinsonism","explanation":"\nParkinsonism is a complication of Wilson disease, which can manifest with hepatomegaly and elevated transaminases (AST and ALT), as seen in this patient. However, this patient lacks other typical features of Wilson disease, such as behavioral changes, neurological symptoms (e.g., tremor, dysarthria), and Kayser-Fleischer rings.","bool":false},{"option":"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma","explanation":"\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in association with infections (e.g., EBV, HCV, Helicobacter pylori), autoimmune diseases (e.g., Hashimoto thyroiditis), and dermatomyositis. However, an association between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and hemochromatosis is less likely.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Adrenal crisis","explanation":"\nAdrenal crisis can occur in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, which causes hyperpigmentation, fatigue, and joint pain, as seen in this patient. However, the hyperpigmentation generally only occurs in areas that are not normally exposed to sunlight (e.g., palm creases, mucous membrane of the oral cavity). Also, in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, decreased libido generally only occurs in women, and other signs, such as weight loss, intestinal complaints, hypotension, and/or hypoglycemia, would be present.","bool":false},{"option":"Rheumatoid arthritis","explanation":"Although symmetric arthralgias and stiffness of metacarpophalangeal joints and fatigue are common findings in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this condition would typically also affect wrist joints and proximal interphalangeal joints, and present with joint deformities (e.g., swan neck deformity). Moreover, RA would not explain this patient's skin hyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus, and reduced libido, making a different diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Pancreatic carcinoma","explanation":"\nPancreatic cancer is associated with several inherited genetic syndromes, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Lynch syndrome, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. However, the link between pancreatic cancer and hemochromatosis is not well established.","bool":false},{"option":"Progressive central obesity","explanation":"Progressive central obesity is associated with Cushing syndrome, which could also cause fatigue, hyperpigmentation, and hyperglycemia. However, hyperpigmentation generally only occurs in areas that are not normally exposed to the sun (e.g., palm creases, oral cavity). Furthermore, proximal muscle weakness, thinning skin, weight gain, and sleep disturbances would be expected. Cushing syndrome would also not explain this patient's hepatomegaly, testicular atrophy, or elevated transaminases and ferritin levels.","bool":false}]},{"id":256,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"\nA 42-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of several episodes of rectal bleeding over the past 2 weeks. He has had pain around the anal area for the past month. Six months ago, he was diagnosed with esophageal candidiasis and was treated with oral fluconazole. He has had 9 male sexual partners over his lifetime and uses condoms inconsistently. The patient's current medications include dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine. He is 179 cm (5 ft 10 in) and weighs 66 kg (146 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Digital rectal examination and anoscopy show a hard 2-cm mass palpable 0.5 cm above the anal verge that bleeds on contact. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy. The abdomen is soft and nontender.

The combination of chemotherapy and radiation is the treatment of choice for patients with anal canal SCC; it has been shown to be superior to surgery, with a 5-year survival rate of ∼ 80%. Subsequent surgery is only indicated if a residual tumor is confirmed with biopsy after the completion of radiochemotherapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Abdominoperineal resection","explanation":"\nAbdominoperineal resection (APR) was formerly the treatment of choice in patients with anal canal SCC. However, a less radical treatment option has been established that has been shown to have higher survival rates than APR.

However, condylomata acuminata are usually asymptomatic. They are painful only in a small percentage of cases and rectal bleeding is a rare sequela. Local 5-FU therapy is insufficient for the treatment of anal canal cancer.","bool":false},{"option":"Submucosal hemorrhoidectomy","explanation":"\nSubmucosal hemorrhoidectomy is indicated for the treatment of grade IV internal hemorrhoids and lower-grade internal hemorrhoids that are resistant to initial treatment. While internal hemorrhoids may present as an anal mass with bright red bleeding, digital rectal examination and anoscopy would reveal a mass arising above the dentate line rather than just above the anal verge.","bool":false},{"option":"Injection sclerotherapy","explanation":"Injection sclerotherapy is used in the treatment of patients with rectal prolapse. Rectal prolapse may present with an anal mass and possibly with bleeding, but the mass tends to be painless and typically exhibits radial (partial prolapse) or concentric (full-thickness prolapse) mucosal folds. Furthermore, the patient does not have fecal incontinence, which does occur in most patients with rectal prolapse, nor does he have predisposing factors for this condition such as elevated intraabdominal pressure (e.g., due to constipation or chronic cough) or weakness of the pelvic floor muscles (e.g., due to advanced age or previous perineal surgery).","bool":false}]},{"id":257,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 73-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss over the last month.

Upper endoscopy is not the initial test of choice for this patient with suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia.","bool":false},{"option":"Esophageal manometry","explanation":"\nEsophageal manometry is indicated in patients with esophageal dysphagia who are believed to have an esophageal motility disorder. Because this patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with oropharyngeal dysphagia than esophageal dysphagia, esophageal manometry is not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Esophagram","explanation":"\nEsophagram via barium swallow classically involves ingestion of barium contrast and acquisition of a single static x-ray image as contrast enters the stomach. Barium swallow is indicated in patients with esophageal dysphagia, most commonly after an upper endoscopy is unrevealing. This patient presents with oropharyngeal, rather than esophageal, dysphagia. A standard barium swallow does not evaluate the oropharynx and is therefore not the preferred initial diagnostic test for this patient.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Transnasal laryngoscopy","explanation":"Transnasal laryngoscopy can be used to visualize the oropharynx, to assess pharyngeal swallowing, and especially to assess possible aspiration and retention of food in the pharynx after swallowing (fiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing). However, it is not the preferred initial test as it does not allow visualization of the food bolus beyond the oropharynx.","bool":false},{"option":"CT scan of the neck","explanation":"\nCT scan of the neck is used as part of the staging process for esophageal cancer. While esophageal cancer can also present with weight loss and dysphagia, this patient developed dysphagia early in the swallowing process, coughing, and nasal regurgitation after a recent stroke, which is indicative of a neuromuscular cause of his symptoms. Furthermore, a staging CT is only indicated after confirmation of esophageal cancer.","bool":false}]},{"id":258,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 61-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of fatigue, diarrhea, and cramping abdominal pain.

It is most often diagnosed in patients 15–35 years of age, but 10% of cases are diagnosed at approx. 60 years of age.","answers":[{"option":"Crohn disease","explanation":"\nCrohn disease has a bimodal distribution of age of onset and can develop in older patients approx. 60 years of age, and smoking is a strong risk factor. This condition typically manifests with chronic, watery, nonbloody diarrhea and abdominal pain (mainly in the right lower quadrant). Common laboratory findings include microcytic anemia and leukocytosis, both of which are seen here. Extraintestinal manifestations, such as the oral aphthae in this patient, are often also present. Biopsy results showing granulomatous inflammation of the colonic mucosa are diagnostic of Crohn disease.","bool":true},{"option":"Ulcerative colitis","explanation":"\nUlcerative colitis (UC) can develop in individuals approx. 60 years of age and manifests with chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. While neutrophilic cryptitis is a common finding in patients with UC, the granulomas seen on this patient's biopsy are not consistent with this diagnosis. Moreover, oral ulcers are not associated with UC, and the diarrhea associated with this condition is typically bloody and occurs with greater frequency (often &gt; 10 times daily).","bool":false},{"option":"Tropical sprue","explanation":"\nTropical sprue is most commonly seen in the tropics and in travelers returning from tropical destinations. Although this patient recently traveled to the Dominican Republic, where tropical sprue is endemic, this condition is usually only seen in patients who have lived in an endemic area for longer than 1 month. Moreover, tropical sprue manifests with malabsorption, steatorrhea, and megaloblastic anemia (due to deficiency of vitamin B12 and folate), which is not consistent with this patient's presentation. Biopsy of the small bowel typically shows villous atrophy and elongated crypts, in contrast to this patient's granulomatous inflammation of the colon.","bool":false},{"option":"Celiac disease","explanation":"\nCeliac disease can also manifest with diarrhea and abdominal pain. This condition classically develops during infancy but can also result in symptoms in the third or fourth decades of life; it is an unlikely diagnosis in this 61-year-old patient. In addition, villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration of the small intestine would be seen on histopathologic examination instead of granulomatous inflammation and neutrophilic cryptitis of the colon.","bool":false},{"option":"Diverticulitis","explanation":"\nDiverticulitis can manifest with fever, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits. Smoking is also a known risk factor for diverticulitis. The pain associated with this condition is, however, usually localized to the left lower quadrant. In addition, diverticulitis more commonly causes constipation rather than diarrhea. Colonoscopy is contraindicated in patients with suspected acute diverticulitis because of the high risk of perforation. Moreover, colon biopsy and histopathological studies are not routinely performed in patients with diverticulitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Behcet disease","explanation":"\nBehcet disease can manifest with painful oral ulcers, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. However, this patient does not have other typical findings of Behcet disease, including genital ulcers and lesions of the skin (e.g., erythema nodosum), eye (e.g., anterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis), and vasculature (e.g., phlebitis, deep vein thrombosis). Moreover, granulomatous inflammation is not a histopathologic finding of this condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Ischemic colitis","explanation":"\nIschemic colitis develops as a result of decreased blood flow to the bowel (e.g., due to thromboembolism, atherosclerosis, severe hypotension). This patient's history of atrial fibrillation puts him at increased risk for ischemic colitis.

The primary etiology of appendicitis in children is lymphatic tissue hyperplasia; the most common etiology in adults is fecalith obstruction. Less common etiologies include obstruction due to foreign bodies, worm infestations, and tumors (e.g., carcinoid tumor). Obstruction within the appendix results in mucus and fluid stasis, allowing bacterial overgrowth and ultimately causing inflammation of the organ.","bool":true},{"option":"Congenital anomaly of the omphalomesenteric duct","explanation":"A congenital anomaly of the omphalomesenteric duct is the underlying cause of Meckel diverticulum. This true diverticulum may contain gastric and/or pancreatic tissue. The ectopic activity of these tissues can result in abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and loss of appetite. However, most cases of Meckel diverticula remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic Meckel diverticula most commonly present with painless gastrointestinal bleeding, which this patient does not have. Moreover, patients with Meckel diverticula are most likely to present with symptoms in the first two years of life.","bool":false},{"option":"Gestation in the fallopian tube","explanation":"\nGestation in the fallopian tube results in ectopic pregnancy. Patients with ectopic pregnancy often experience lower unilateral abdominal pain resulting in guarding, vomiting, and a loss of appetite.

In general, IgG immunoglobulins are not the first antibodies produced by the immune system in response to an acute infection, and in HEV infections, they reach their peak 4 weeks after initial infection. This patient likely developed an acute hepatitis infection one week ago, making the detection of anti-HEV IgG antibodies unlikely at this stage. Additionally, hepatitis E is less common than other types of viral hepatitis.","bool":false},{"option":"HBsAg","explanation":"\nHBsAg is a surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that indicates active hepatitis B infection. Patients with an acute hepatitis B infection may present with acute hepatitis similarly to this case, but it is often subclinical. In many cases, infection persists and leads to chronic hepatitis years later. HBV may be transmitted sexually, parenterally (e.g., needlestick injury), or perinatally. This patient does not have risk factors (e.g., multiple sex partners, exposure to HBV-infected persons, or IV drug use) for any of these modes of transmission, making hepatitis B an unlikely diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Anti-HAV IgM antibodies","explanation":"This patient has acute viral hepatitis, most likely caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). The virus is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, usually as a result of ingestion of undercooked contaminated food (especially raw shellfish). HAV is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions, which the patient may have visited through her job as a flight attendant. After an incubation period of 2–6 weeks, patients develop a prodrome of fever, nausea, vomiting, and tender hepatomegaly (weeks 1–2), which typically resolves with the onset of the icteric phase, characterized by signs and symptoms of cholestasis (week 2). The presence of anti-HAV IgM antibodies, which usually develop within 5–10 days of exposure and are the first immunoglobulins produced by the immune system in response to the HAV, confirms the diagnosis of an active HAV infection. Anti-HAV IgG antibodies usually develop 2–3 weeks after the start of an active infection and persist indefinitely. HAV infection is generally self-limited and most patients only require supportive care.","bool":true},{"option":"Antimitochondrial antibodies","explanation":"\nAnti-mitochondrial antibodies are highly suggestive of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which typically affects women aged 35–60 years and manifests with fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, and dark urine with pale stools.

Histopathological examination of bile ducts would typically show periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis that are consistent with the characteristic onion-skin appearance. PSC, which is classically seen in middle-aged men, increases the risk of development of cancer of the gallbladder and cholangiocarcinoma (10–15% of cases).

Alcohol consumption and obesity are other risk factors for diverticulosis. Diverticular bleeding can occur as a result of erosions of the vasa recta (intestines) around the diverticular edges and manifests with intermittent painless hematochezia, which if recurrent can cause micro- or normocytic anemia.\nThe diagnostic method of choice for diverticulosis is colonoscopy, which visualizes diverticula as outpouchings in the colon.

In a patient with a history of autoimmune disease (Hashimoto thyroiditis), this constellation of findings is consistent with autoimmune atrophic gastritis.","answers":[{"option":"Gastric adenocarcinoma","explanation":"\nAutoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG) can lead to intestinal metaplasia, which increases the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. Patients with AMAG are also at increased risk for carcinoid tumors because of the presence of autoantibodies against parietal cells, which normally produce gastric acid. The resulting achlorhydria stimulates the release of gastrin and antral G-cell hyperplasia, resulting in hypergastrinemia. Hypergastrinemia, in turn, is associated with enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia, which may progress to gastric carcinoid tumor.","bool":true},{"option":"Duodenal perforation","explanation":"\nDuodenal perforation is a complication of environmental atrophic gastritis, which is due to increased production of gastric acids in H. pylori infection and resulting mucosal inflammation and thinning.

In H. pylori infection, ulceration is caused not by gastric acid reflux but by altered secretion and tissue injury. Duodenal ulcers may manifest with epigastric pain occurring several hours after a meal, which is not consistent with this patient's immediate postprandial pain. While a gastric ulcer could be consistent with this patient's nausea and postprandial epigastric pain, gastric (and duodenal) ulcers were not found on upper endoscopy.

The initial diagnosis is made with urinalysis and urine culture and confirmed on abdominal CT enterography or MR enterography. Alternatively, enteroclysis may be used, but this method is more invasive than CT enterography or MR enterography. Typical imaging findings include air and/or contrast medium within the bladder and thickening of the adjacent bladder and intestinal walls.

Cirrhosis can result in a hyperestrogenic state in which there is an increased estrogen/androgen ratio. This is likely due to increased peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens and decreased hepatic breakdown of estrogen in men with cirrhosis, as well as increased binding and thus inactivation of free testosterone caused by increased amounts of sex-hormone-binding globulin. Other features of hyperestrogenism seen in this patient are spider angiomata and loss of pubic hair.","bool":true},{"option":"Testicular atrophy and abdominal distension","explanation":"Although testicular atrophy and abdominal distension are both associated with cirrhosis, they have different underlying pathophysiologies. Hypogonadism in cirrhosis, manifesting as testicular atrophy, is thought to be due to multiple factors, including primary gonadal injury, suppression of hypothalamic or pituitary function, as well as binding and inactivation of free testosterone caused by increased amounts of sex-hormone-binding globulin. Abdominal distension, on the other hand, is caused by ascites, a complication of both portal hypertension and decreased hepatic albumin synthesis.","bool":false},{"option":"Jaundice and flapping tremor","explanation":"Although jaundice and flapping tremor are both associated with cirrhosis, they have different underlying pathophysiologies. Jaundice results from the inability of the liver to conjugate bilirubin, which leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Consequently, neurotransmission of joint position sense to the brain is impaired.","bool":false},{"option":"Caput medusae and spider angiomata","explanation":"Although both caput medusae and spider angiomata are caused by an abnormal dilation of blood vessels and are both associated with cirrhosis, they have different underlying pathophysiologies. Spider angiomata are thought to be caused by hyperestrogenism resulting from an increase in the estradiol/free testosterone ratio. Caput medusae, on the other hand, is a pathognomonic sign of portal hypertension that is caused by portosystemic shunting of blood between the portal paraumbilical veins and the systemic superficial epigastric veins due to increased resistance to portal venous flow in liver cirrhosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Splenomegaly and Dupuytren contracture","explanation":"Although splenomegaly and Dupuytren contracture are both associated with cirrhosis, they have different underlying pathophysiologies. Splenomegaly in cirrhosis is caused by increased pressure within the splenic vein due to portal hypertension. Even though the reason for the thickening of the palmar fascia seen in Dupuytren contracture is still incompletely understood, it is unlikely that portal hypertension would directly cause fibroblastic proliferation and disorderly collagen deposition associated with the contracture.","bool":false},{"option":"Esophageal varices and pedal edema","explanation":"Although esophageal varices and pedal edemas are both associated with cirrhosis, they have different underlying pathophysiologies. Esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis occur due to portal hypertension because they are a site of portosystemic shunting of blood. Pedal edema can occur as a result of decreased hepatic synthesis of albumin, which decreases the plasma oncotic pressure, causing fluid to shift from the intravascular compartment into the peripheral tissues.","bool":false},{"option":"Multiple bruises and loss of pubic hair","explanation":"Although easy bruising and loss of pubic hair are both associated with cirrhosis, they have different underlying pathophysiologies. In cirrhosis, the hepatic production of coagulation factors is impaired, which can lead to coagulopathy and, consequently, easy bruising.

He appears fatigued. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 106/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a mildly distended abdomen. Rectal examination is painful; there is oozing of mucous-covered stool. Serum prostate-specific antigen concentration is 2.12 ng/mL (N &lt; 4). Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Pelvic and rectal pain, diarrhea, mucus discharge, and fecal urgency suggest radiation proctitis.","answers":[{"option":"Mucosal radiation damage","explanation":"Radiation damage to the rectal mucosa causes acute radiation proctitis (ARP), which manifests with pelvic and rectal pain, mucus in diarrhea, tenesmus, and/or fecal urgency within 6 weeks of radiation therapy (see “Radiation proctitis” table). The risk of ARP depends on the radiation dose to the rectum and how much of the rectum receives radiation. Evaluation of patients with suspected ARP consists of a detailed history, laboratory tests with stool cultures to exclude infection, and, if there is diagnostic uncertainty, endoscopy with biopsies. Supportive treatment with antidiarrheals, hydration, and sodium butyrate enemas is usually sufficient.","bool":true},{"option":"Bacterial invasion of the colon","explanation":"Bacterial invasion of the colon (e.g., by Campylobacter jejuni) causes infectious colitis (IC), which can manifest with diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, fecal urgency, and tenesmus. Receptive anal or oral-anal sex is a risk factor for the transmission of bacterial pathogens. However, bacterial IC typically causes acute, self-limiting diarrhea rather than progressively worsening, persistent diarrhea. Moreover, bacterial IC is usually associated with bloody diarrhea and fever.","bool":false},{"option":"Toxin-mediated inflammation","explanation":"Toxin-mediated inflammation of the colon is the pathomechanism of Clostridioides difficile colitis. This condition can also manifest with lower abdominal pain, fecal urgency, and nonbloody diarrhea and most commonly occurs following antibiotic treatment (e.g., with cephalosporins). However, C. difficile colitis is typically associated with watery and foul-smelling diarrhea and fever. Mucus in stool and a painful rectal examination are not expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Obliteration of colonic vessels","explanation":"Obliteration of colonic vessels is the pathomechanism of chronic radiation proctopathy, a type of chronic radiation injury that can manifest with rectal pain as well as fecal urgency following radiation therapy to the pelvis. However, chronic radiation proctopathy is typically associated with constipation (due to fibrosis of the colonic wall) rather than diarrhea. Most importantly, this condition is a late complication of radiation therapy, occuring &gt; 3 months after exposure.","bool":false},{"option":"Local cancer spread","explanation":"Local spread of prostate cancer cells into the rectum can cause rectal pain, diarrhea, fecal urgency, and tenesmus. This patient, however, was diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and underwent brachytherapy, which is considered a definitive treatment. Moreover, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is currently within the reference range, whereas a recent cancer spread or metastasis into the rectum would lead to a significant increase in the PSA level.","bool":false}]},{"id":280,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of fatigue and yellowish discoloration of his eyes and skin.

Which of the following effects is most likely to occur if she receives antibiotic therapy?","difficulty":4,"hint":"Salmonella are gram-negative rods that produce hydrogen sulfide and do not ferment lactose. Nontyphoidal species of salmonella (e.g., Salmonella enterica) can cause dysentery. Uncooked poultry products are a common source of salmonella infections.","answers":[{"option":"Prolonged fecal excretion of the pathogen","explanation":"\nSalmonella gastroenteritis may be treated with antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin). However, a potential side effect of this treatment is the prolonged fecal excretion of salmonella. The mechanism behind this is not known. Because of this side effect, antibiotics should only be used if clinically indicated and for an adequate duration. Antibiotics are only indicated for severe cases of salmonella gastroenteritis, which include diarrhea that occurs more than 9 times per day or the presence of systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, tachycardia, hypotonia). This patient only has local symptoms with normal vital signs, hence she would not qualify for antibiotics.","bool":true},{"option":"Self-limiting systemic inflammatory response","explanation":"A self-limiting systemic inflammatory response describes the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which is a reaction to bacterial endotoxins that are released after antibiotic therapy initiation. This reaction is commonly seen following the treatment of spirochete infections, such as syphilis or Lyme disease. However, this patient does not show signs of syphilis (primary skin lesions and regional nontender lymphadenopathy) or Lyme disease (e.g., erythema chronicum migrans, migratory arthritis, cranial nerve palsy, polyneuropathy, carditis).

However, this patient has no signs of infectious mononucleosis (e.g., splenomegaly, pharyngitis, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy) and therefore would not develop this reaction. Furthermore, pathogen detection shows rods, not a double-stranded, enveloped DNA virus, and uncooked poultry products are not a source of EBV infections.","bool":false},{"option":"Orange discoloration of bodily fluids","explanation":"Orange discoloration of bodily secretions such as urine, sweat, and saliva is a common side-effect of rifampin treatment. Rifampin is used for the treatment of tuberculosis or as a prophylaxis when in contact with patients infected with N. meningitidis. However, this patient does not show signs of tuberculosis (e.g., dyspnea, productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, lymphadenopathy) and has not been in contact with patients infected with N. meningitidis. Pathogen detection also shows rods, not gram-positive, acid-fast bacilli, and uncooked poultry products are not a common source of M. tuberculosis infections.","bool":false},{"option":"Thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia","explanation":"\nThrombocytopenia with hemolytic anemia describes hemolytic uremic syndrome, a complication sometimes seen when antibiotics are initiated in Shigella or EHEC infection. E. coli and Shigella are gram-negative rods, which can be transmitted by uncooked poultry products. However, in contrast to salmonella, E. coli ferments lactose and Shigella does not produce hydrogen sulfide. In addition, salmonellosis can be treated with ceftriaxone, which can induce hemolytic anemia; however, this treatment would not cause thrombocytopenia.","bool":false}]},{"id":283,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 4-hour history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain that radiates to her right shoulder.

Vomiting in hypertrophic pyloric stenosis causes dehydration with loss of hydrogen chloride and potassium chloride. The hypovolemia also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone, which further worsens hypokalemia and causes the paradoxical aciduria, seen in this patient, as well as a contraction alkalosis (a chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis). The initial management of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis involves intravenous fluid therapy with 0.9% NaCl to correct the extracellular volume loss and replete chloride, thereby ensuring adequate chloride delivery to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Adequate chloride delivery to the DCT is necessary for the activity of the pendrin exchanger, which reabsorbs chloride in exchange for excreting bicarbonate into the lumen of the DCT.

In addition, high-risk alcohol use and findings of a nodular liver surface, hepatomegaly, telangiectasias, and ascites (shifting dullness, free intraperitoneal fluid) suggest cirrhosis and hepatic dysfunction, which should be considered for clinical decision-making.","answers":[{"option":"Abdominal paracentesis","explanation":"In patients with ascites, abdominal paracentesis is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Patients with cirrhosis are at much higher risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, especially if complications of liver dysfunction are present (e.g., ascites, coagulopathy, encephalopathy). Perioperative mortality increases with Child-Pugh score (grade A-10%, B-30%, C-80%). In all but the most urgent surgeries, patients with cirrhosis should have such complications corrected before proceeding to surgery in order to minimize the risk of surgical morbidity. In this case, abdominal paracentesis would allow for laboratory analysis of the ascitic fluid. Additionally, it would also help relieve the high intraabdominal pressure associated with ascites, thus, decreasing the risk of surgical wound dehiscence.\nThis patient may also receive fresh frozen plasma given her borderline coagulation studies and IV antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) for her cholecystitis. Once ascites and coagulation are normalized, she should undergo cholecystectomy.","bool":true},{"option":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy","explanation":"\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard treatment option for cholecystitis in good operative candidates.

Other interventions are indicated before it is safe to proceed with cholecystectomy.","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous vitamin K","explanation":"\nVitamin K is indicated to correct elevated PT/INR in non-emergencies. While this patient may benefit from correction of her borderline-elevated INR, vitamin K supplementation is ineffective in patients with cirrhosis. Vitamin K is simply a substrate used by the liver to make clotting factors. However, if the liver's synthetic function is compromised (as in cirrhotics), then vitamin K supplementation will not have any significant effect on coagulation. In coagulopathic patients with cirrhosis, clotting factors themselves (e.g., FFP) must be provided.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral rifaximin and lactulose","explanation":"Oral rifaximin and lactulose are both first-line treatments for hepatic encephalopathy, for which this patient is at risk given her cirrhosis.

In early dumping syndrome, large amounts of carbohydrate-rich food are emptied rapidly into the small intestine, causing fluid shifts and sympathetic activation. To prevent this, initial treatment involves frequent, small, low-carbohydrate meals to reduce the osmotic load on the small intestine. Other behavioral modifications (e.g., 30–60 min of supine rest) may also be helpful. Symptoms of early dumping syndrome are usually self-limiting and resolve after a few months. Dumping syndrome that is not adequately controlled with dietary modification can be treated with octreotide.","bool":true},{"option":"Stool microscopy","explanation":"\nStool microscopy helps to diagnose parasitic infection, which is a potential cause of diarrhea, particularly in patients returning from travels abroad, as is the case here.

Patients commonly present with a painless rectal mass characterized by concentric mucosal folds, abdominal discomfort, incomplete evacuation, and perianal pruritus. Fecal incontinence can also occur as a result of stretching of the anal sphincter by the prolapsed rectum. The diagnosis is primarily clinical. In older patients, a rectal neoplasm can cause rectal intussusception, which in turn can lead to rectal prolapse.

The source of bleeding can be localized fast (does not require bowel preparation) and reliably if the bleeding rate is more than 0.5–1 mL/min. Some centers opt to conduct CT angiography for visualization of the bleed and analysis of anatomic detail before proceeding with invasive catheter angiography for directed therapeutic intervention (e.g., embolization, vasopressin injection). If angiography fails to locate the source of bleeding, a colonoscopy is the next step in management.

It can directly localize the source of bleeding and also allows therapeutic interventions to be performed. However, colonoscopy requires time-consuming bowel preparation, which a hemodynamically unstable patient may not be able to tolerate. Lack of appropriate bowel preparation and severe bleeding hinder visualization with this procedure, resulting in a poor diagnostic yield. Moreover, detecting the bleeding source via colonoscopy is limited to the terminal ileum, colon, and rectum.

The presence of pneumaturia in a patient with diverticular disease indicates the formation of a colovesical fistula (CVF).","answers":[{"option":"Recurrent urinary tract infections","explanation":"If left untreated, CVF predisposes the patient to recurrent urinary tract infections. Diverticulitis is the most common cause of CVF (65–80% of cases); localized inflammation of the peridiverticular tissue can result in the formation of a phlegmon or a diverticular abscess that can rupture into adjacent organs, creating a fistula.

In most patients with CVF, surgical repair is indicated.","bool":true},{"option":"Chronic inflammation of the bile ducts","explanation":"\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis, a form of chronic bile duct inflammation, is a potential complication of ulcerative colitis (UC) and, to a lesser extent, Crohn disease (CD). UC, however, is only associated with mucosal and submucosal inflammation and therefore does not typically result in fistula formation. Although CD is associated with transmural bowel inflammation and can result in a colovesical fistula, the previous colonoscopy would have shown evidence of this condition (e.g., ulcers, fissures, cobblestoning of the mucosa).

Medical management (e.g., paracentesis, pain control, luminal decompression by nasogastric tube) and regular IAP checks follow surgical decompression and should continue until IAP is consistently &lt; 12 mm Hg. Prolonged surgery (especially involving the abdominal compartment) requiring ample IV fluid and transfusions may result in a rise in IAP secondary to tissue fluid build-up. Rising IAP causes a tense and distended abdomen and leads to abdominal compartment syndrome if the pressure continues to rise (especially ≥ 20 mm Hg, even less in children). This condition prevents blood in the inferior vena cava from reaching the heart (↓ preload), thereby causing a reduction in cardiac output that leads to hypotension, reactive tachycardia, and prerenal kidney injury due to reduced perfusion (causes oliguria and BUN:Cr &gt; 20).

Most strictures develop approximately 2 months after the initial injury. In patients with esophageal caustic injury, esophageal dysmotility (due to strictures and neuromuscular damage) can lead to severe dysphagia. Other long-term complications of caustic liquid ingestion include tracheoesophageal fistulas and esophageal cancer.\nAcute complications of caustic liquid ingestion are esophageal ulcers and esophageal perforation, which can result in mediastinitis or peritonitis.","bool":true},{"option":"Barrett esophagus","explanation":"\nBarrett esophagus is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux.

This condition can develop along any part of the colon but most commonly involves the sigmoid colon (which explains the localization of this patient's abdominal pain). Her 12-month history of intermittent constipation likely results in straining during bowel movements, which can lead to protrusion of herniated intestinal mucosa and submucosa through gaps in the muscular layer of the intestinal wall (i.e., diverticulosis). If stool gets lodged in the diverticula, this can result in obstruction of the intestinal lumen, increased intraluminal pressure, and subsequent erosion and inflammation of diverticular walls (i.e., diverticulitis).\nThis diagnosis is supported by clinical manifestations and the presence of increased serum inflammatory markers. A CT scan that shows inflamed diverticula, bowel wall thickening (&gt; 4 mm), and/or inflammation of pericolic fat with fat stranding confirms the diagnosis.

He has had a swelling of the left groin for the past 2 months. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. Current medications include amlodipine, an albuterol inhaler, and a salmeterol-fluticasone inhaler. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg. Examination shows a tender bulge on the left side above the inguinal ligament that extends into the left scrotum; lying down does not reduce the swelling.

Acute onset of severe groin pain, vomiting, an inguinal bulge with overlying erythema and warmth, and a distended abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds indicate acute hernia strangulation with concurrent bowel obstruction.","answers":[{"option":"Open surgical repair","explanation":"\nOpen surgical repair is indicated for all patients with complicated inguinal hernias, i.e., incarcerated hernias with concurrent bowel obstruction or strangulation. This patient must undergo surgery within 4–6 hours of the onset of symptoms to avoid possible bowel loss secondary to tissue necrosis. In patients with complicated inguinal hernias, an open approach is preferred because it is easier to perform and associated with a decreased risk of bowel injury.\nThe most commonly used techniques for open surgical repair are Lichtenstein repair and Shouldice repair. During Lichtenstein repair, a synthetic mesh is implemented between the abdominal internal oblique muscle and the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique muscle. For the Shouldice procedure, the transverse fascia is doubled and fixated to the abdominal internal oblique muscle and transverse muscle at the inguinal ligament by suture (a nonmesh repair).","bool":true},{"option":"Antibiotic therapy","explanation":"\nAntibiotic therapy is an appropriate treatment for epididymitis. While epididymitis manifests with swelling or bulging of the scrotum, it usually does not cause an acute onset of groin pain.

This patient has a strangulated inguinal hernia, for which antibiotics are not the treatment of choice.","bool":false},{"option":"Laparoscopic surgical repair","explanation":"\nLaparoscopic surgical repair is indicated for uncomplicated hernias and is usually carried out as an elective procedure. Because laparoscopic surgery is associated with a higher risk of bowel injury compared to other approaches, it should not be performed on patients with strangulated or incarcerated hernias and evidence of bowel obstruction. Furthermore, the placement of a synthetic mesh, which is required in laparoscopic hernia repair, should be avoided in patients at risk of surgical site infection, e.g., as a result of bowel perforation.","bool":false},{"option":"Taxis under general anesthesia","explanation":"Prior to the introduction of surgical hernia repair, taxis (manual reduction) was the treatment of choice for incarcerated hernias without concurrent bowel obstruction.

In conjunction with a history of hematochezia (fresh blood in stool), this presentation is highly suggestive of chronic intestinal bleeding.","answers":[{"option":"Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall","explanation":"This patient most likely has chronic intestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia (an arteriovenous malformation) in the colonic wall. Angiodysplasia is associated with older age (&gt; 60 years) and ESRD. In patients with ESRD, ∼ 30% of cases of lower GI bleeding are due to angiodysplasia. However, the association between gastrointestinal angiodysplasia and ESRD is not fully understood. Other conditions associated with angiodysplasia include von Willebrand disease and aortic stenosis.\nIn hemodynamically stable patients, colonoscopy is the best next step in management for suspected lower gastrointestinal bleeding and can be followed by upper endoscopy if the diagnosis remains unclear. Although angiography is the gold-standard method for diagnosing angiodysplasia, endoscopy is frequently the first modality used, as it can be both diagnostic and therapeutic; however, angiodysplasia is not always detected during routine endoscopy. Patients with active bleeding and/or those with iron deficiency anemia should undergo endoscopic coagulation (e.g., using cautery, electrocoagulation, or clipping).","bool":true},{"option":"Inflammation in an outpouching of the colonic wall","explanation":"\nDiverticulitis (i.e., inflammation in an outpouching of the colonic wall) should not be confused with diverticulosis, which is the most common cause of recurrent, self-limited, lower GI bleeding and also causes anemia.

This patient's ESRD and diabetes mellitus put him at increased risk for ischemic colitis. While ischemic colitis can lead to GI bleeding, it would typically manifest with a sudden onset of symptoms, as opposed to this patient's gradual progression of clinical findings over the past 6 months. Moreover, ischemic colitis manifests with severe periumbilical pain, diarrhea, and high fever.","bool":false},{"option":"Malignant transformation of colonic mucosal cells","explanation":"\nColorectal cancer can arise from colonic polyps and manifests with hematochezia and iron deficiency anemia due to chronic lower gastrointestinal bleeding. However, other typical symptoms of colorectal cancer, such as weight loss, fever, night sweats, and changes in bowel habits are absent in this patient. Furthermore, prior colonoscopy only showed hyperplastic polyps, which are of low malignant potential and were removed. Therefore, this patient's symptoms are more likely caused by another condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation of the colon","explanation":"Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation of the colon is characteristic of ulcerative colitis, which can manifest with recurrent bloody stools and anemia.

Right upper quadrant pain, nausea, fever, and leukocytosis suggest acute cholecystitis.","answers":[{"option":"Obstruction of the cystic duct","explanation":"\nCholecystitis is usually caused by the passage of gallstones into the cystic duct. Cystic duct obstruction can lead to gallbladder inflammation with symptoms of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and fever, as seen in this patient. Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) typically shows delayed or absent uptake of radioactive tracer in the gallbladder; a HIDA scan is primarily used to diagnose cystic duct obstruction if RUQ ultrasound fails to show gallstones. In uncomplicated cholecystitis, cholestasis parameters (i.e., ALP, GGT, and bilirubin) are typically normal or only mildly elevated because there is usually no obstruction of the hepatic ducts or common bile duct.","bool":true},{"option":"Infection with a hepatotropic virus","explanation":"Infection with a hepatotropic virus (e.g., hepatitis A) can cause acute hepatitis. While acute hepatitis can manifest with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and fever, it usually also manifests with markedly elevated liver function tests (e.g., AST, ALT), which are only mildly elevated in this patient. Moreover, a cholescintigraphy showing delayed uptake of radioactive tracer in the gallbladder suggests another etiology.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypomotility of the gallbladder","explanation":"Hypomotility of the gallbladder can result in biliary stasis, which predisposes to gallstone development and cholecystitis.

However, patients with fibrosis of the common bile duct would be expected to have markedly elevated cholestasis parameters (i.e., ALP, GGT, and bilirubin). Moreover, cholescintigraphy would show impaired uptake of the radioactive tracer in the proximal bowel rather than delayed uptake of radioactive tracer in the gallbladder.","bool":false},{"option":"Fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine","explanation":"A cholecystoenteric fistula (fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine) is often due to inflammation of the gallbladder wall. Fistulization provides a conduit for passage of gallstones, which may cause gallstone ileus. Patients with gallstone ileus can present with abdominal pain, nausea, and fever. However, physical examination would classically show high-pitched (tympanic) bowel sounds. In addition, even though cholescintigraphy is not a sensitive test for gallstone ileus, it would be expected to show communication between the gallbladder and intestinal tract rather than delayed uptake of radioactive tracer in the gallbladder. CT is the preferred imaging modality to confirm gallstone ileus and classically shows bowel obstruction with pneumobilia.","bool":false},{"option":"Autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma","explanation":"Autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma due to a local release of digestive proteolytic enzymes is seen in pancreatitis. While pancreatitis can manifest with abdominal pain, nausea, and fever, the abdominal pain in pancreatitis is typically epigastric (not right upper abdominal pain) and radiates towards the back.

The diagnosis is typically confirmed on biopsy, which shows intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltrates in lymphocytic MC (as seen in this patient) or thick, subepithelial collagen bands in collagenous MC. About 50% of patients with MC also present with mild anemia and increased inflammatory markers.

Inactivation of pancreatic enzymes by gastric acid hypersecretion can cause diarrhea.","answers":[{"option":"Fasting serum gastrin level","explanation":"Determining the fasting serum gastrin level after discontinuation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is the best initial test for diagnosing gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). A 10-fold increase in gastrin levels is conclusive evidence of a gastrinoma. A gastrin-producing tumor is suggested by the patient's extended course of symptoms and multiple peptic ulcers that have been refractory to PPI therapy. Even though gastrinomas are a rare cause of PUD, more than 95% of patients with gastrinoma present with PUD. More frequent causes of PUD, such as infection with Helicobacter pylori or long-term use of NSAIDs can be ruled out based on patient history.\nIn addition to determining the fasting serum gastrin level, this patient's gastric pH should also be measured.

This contrast-enhanced CT scan shows multiple hypodense solitary lesions with peripheral rim enhancement in both lobes of the liver, characteristic of hepatic metastases. These features are highly suggestive of a primary colorectal malignancy that has metastasized to the liver, the most frequent metastatic site for this condition. The palpable hepatomegaly with a hard nodule and mildly deranged liver function tests are caused by the metastatic deposits.","bool":true},{"option":"Liver hemangioma","explanation":"A liver hemangioma, when symptomatic, causes upper gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea, early satiety) in contrast to this patient's primarily lower gastrointestinal symptoms (intermittent constipation with abdominal distention). Furthermore, liver hemangiomas do not cause weight loss or blood in the stool. On contrast-enhanced CT scan, liver hemangioma can also appear as a hypodense lesion with peripheral rim enhancement but are usually solitary.","bool":false},{"option":"Cholangiocarcinoma","explanation":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (IHC) may manifest with weight loss and hepatomegaly in the absence of cholestasis (jaundice, pruritus). On contrast-enhanced CT scan, a mass-forming IHC is seen as a hypodense lesion with peripheral rim enhancement. However, IHCs are usually solitary, the center of the lesion shows heterogenic echogenicity (compared to the anechoic centers in this patient) and dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. IHCs do not cause constipation or occult blood in stool, and ALP is usually elevated in IHC but is normal in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Hepatic echinococcal cysts","explanation":"\nEchinococcus granulosus is endemic in Mexico. This patient's travel history to Mexico is a risk factor for the development of a hepatic echinococcal cyst (hydatid cyst) and the infection may be asymptomatic for months, presenting with tender hepatomegaly when large enough. However, echinococcal cysts do not cause constipation, fever, or weight loss. A hepatic echinococcal cyst is seen on contrast-enhanced CT scan (CECT) as a hypodense cyst with multiple septations and individual \"daughter cysts” within the main cyst. The septations give the cyst a characteristic spoke wheel pattern. This patient's history and CECT with multiple, solid, nonseptate lesions that have a peripheral rim enhancement suggest another diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","explanation":"\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may manifest with weight loss, abdominal distention, and deranged liver function tests. However, HCC does not cause lower gastrointestinal symptoms or occult blood in stool. On contrast-enhanced CT scan, HCC appears as a solitary hepatic lesion that characteristically enhances brightly in the arterial phase and appears hypodense in the venous phase due to the rapid contrast washout. Although this patient's CT scan also shows hypodense lesions, the presence of multiple lesions and only minimal rim enhancement in the arterial phase makes HCC an unlikely diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Liver abscess","explanation":"A liver abscess may also manifest with fever, blood in stool, tender hepatomegaly, and mild derangement of liver function tests. However, patients with a pyogenic liver abscess would have features of sepsis (tachycardia, tachypnea) and often, a history of intra-abdominal infection (diarrhea, cholangitis, appendicitis). Mexico is endemic for Entamoeba histolytica and this patient's recent travel history may suggest that she contracted an amebic liver abscess. But most amebic liver abscesses are solitary and this patient's history of weight loss precedes her trip to Mexico. A liver abscess is usually seen on contrast-enhanced CT scan as a solitary, well-defined, fluid-filled hypodense lesion with surrounding hyperemic hepatic parenchyma, unlike the solid lesions seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Cirrhosis","explanation":"Daily consumption of alcohol is a risk factor for the development of cirrhosis. Compensated cirrhotic patients may present with nonspecific symptoms (fatigue, weight loss) in the absence of jaundice, ascites, or variceal bleed.

Evidence of occult blood in stool may occur in cirrhosis in the case of a minor gastrointestinal bleed (secondary to esophageal/gastric varices).

Physiological neonatal jaundice, which is caused by a physiological rise in unconjugated bilirubin, is very common (affecting around half of term infants) and typically occurs between the second and eighth day of life. Because newborns have a higher hematocrit (due to relative hypoxia during the fetal period) and a shorter life span of fetal red blood cells (RBCs), RBC turnover is increased within the first 3 months of life, resulting in higher bilirubin production. In addition, the hepatic conjugation and elimination pathways for bilirubin are still immature due to decreased activity of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin is also increased because the concentration of bacteria in the neonatal digestive tract is low and therefore only a small amount of bilirubin is converted to urobilinogen and subsequently excreted.\nJaundice occurring within the first 24 hours of life or persisting &gt; 1 week should raise suspicion for underlying pathology and warrants further diagnostic tests. Additional symptoms such as poor feeding and drowsiness would also warrant further evaluation.","bool":true},{"option":"Increasing frequency of breastfeeding","explanation":"Insufficient breast milk intake (&lt; 8–12 times within 24 hours) can lead to breastfeeding failure jaundice, which is characterized by dehydration, weight loss, and a decreased number of wet diapers. The mother reports breastfeeding her son frequently without difficulty, and the newborn has an adequate amount of wet and soiled diapers. Therefore, increasing the frequency of breastfeeding is not necessary.","bool":false},{"option":"Phototherapy","explanation":"\nPhototherapy is the primary treatment in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. However, it is only indicated in neonates with total serum bilirubin above a certain threshold specific to age and risk factors, as designated by the American Academy of Pediatrics. In the case of this healthy 5-day-old newborn, the threshold is 21 mg/dL. Below this threshold, the risk of complications (e.g., kernicterus, acute bilirubin encephalopathy) is low and does not outweigh the possible side effects of phototherapy (e.g., diarrhea, dehydration, and skin rashes).","bool":false},{"option":"Exchange transfusion","explanation":"\nExchange transfusion is the most rapid method for lowering serum bilirubin concentrations. It is indicated if the total serum bilirubin (TSB) exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., &gt; 25 mg/dL in a full-term infant at 5 days), the TSB rises &gt; 1 mg/dL in less than 6 hours, the response to phototherapy is inadequate, or in the case of severe underlying causes (e.g., hemolytic disease, severe anemia) or complications (e.g., acute bilirubin encephalopathy). This patient does not meet any of the criteria for this treatment option.","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","explanation":"\nIntravenous immunoglobulin is indicated in severe cases of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Although neonates with HDFN typically present with jaundice, the yellowing of the skin is usually present at birth or develops within the first 24 hours of life, and the total serum bilirubin levels would be higher. In addition, patients with severe HDFN would have signs of hemolysis and anemia (e.g., hepatosplenomegaly, hypoxia) as a result of the rapid breakdown of antigen-antibody complexes and fetal red blood cells in the spleen.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral phenobarbital","explanation":"\nPhenobarbital may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II, as it causes the residual UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity to increase and prevents or limits clinical manifestations. Both Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I and II can manifest with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and neonatal jaundice. Type II disorder tends to be less severe and is often asymptomatic at birth. Although this patient's findings could be due to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II, the timing, duration, and severity of jaundice are more suggestive of a physiologic process. For this reason, and because there is no family history of neonatal jaundice, diagnostic evaluation or treatment for Crigler-Najjar syndrome is not indicated at this point.","bool":false},{"option":"Abdominal sonography","explanation":"Abdominal sonography is indicated in the diagnosis of extrahepatic cholestasis (e.g., biliary atresia or choledochal cysts). Both conditions can manifest with neonatal jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia. However, since the excretion of bilirubin via bile into the intestine is disrupted, the direct bilirubin would be elevated. In addition, acholic stools (because bilirubin does not reach the intestine to be converted to urobilin and stercobilin) and dark urine (due to excretion of bilirubin via the urine) would be expected in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Hepatomegaly and mild to moderate elevation of the aminotransferases are also usually present. In this neonate with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, an extrahepatic obstruction is unlikely.","bool":false}]},{"id":341,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"\nA 24-year-old woman with Turner syndrome comes to the physician because of diarrhea for the past 4 months.

AFP levels are usually used as a screening tool for patients who are at high risk for HCC (e.g., history of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis) and also for treatment monitoring in patients with a confirmed diagnosis. In early stages of HCC, AFP often remains normal. In addition, AFP has low specificity for HCC as it can also be increased in patients with hepatitis or cirrhosis and no associated malignancy. Therefore, a positive AFP test should be followed by a more accurate diagnostic test such as abdominal CT or MRI to establish a definitive diagnosis of HCC.","bool":true},{"option":"Exophytic tumor on colonoscopy","explanation":"Detection of an exophytic tumor on colonoscopy is diagnostic of colorectal cancer (CRC). The liver is most commonly affected by multiple metastases that are spread via the portal vein.

However, considering the patient's history and that PBC is much more common in women, another diagnosis is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Positive blood cultures","explanation":"In a patient with a solitary liver lesion on ultrasonography, positive blood cultures are indicative of a pyogenic liver abscess. Pyogenic liver abscesses most commonly develop secondary to biliary tract obstructions but may also be caused by bacteremia (e.g., in individuals who inject drugs). However, since this patient no longer uses IV drugs, he is not at increased risk of bacteremia. While an abscess can be both the first manifestation or a complication of this patient's condition, in the absence of fever, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, and leukocytosis, this diagnosis is less likely.

Shigella enters cells via pinocytosis before lysing vesicles and entering the cytoplasm. Once inside the cytoplasm, Shigella produces Shiga toxin and rapidly poisons the cell. This mechanism is key to Shigella's ability to cause disease even in cases of very small exposure to the bacteria (i.e., Shigella has a very low infectious dose). Once inside the colonic mucosa, Shigella travels from cell to cell via actin polymerization.","bool":true},{"option":"Overactivation of adenylate cyclase","explanation":"Overactivation of adenylate cyclase is the mechanism of cholera toxin (produced by Vibrio cholerae) and of heat-labile toxin (produced by enterotoxigenic E. coli; ETEC). Both toxins increase cAMP, leading to higher chloride secretion with resulting water efflux. However, the result of such water efflux is profuse, nonbloody diarrhea, in contrast to this patient's blood-tinged diarrhea.

In a child with a history of recent blunt abdominal trauma (e.g., handlebar injury during a fall from a bicycle), duodenal hematoma is the most likely diagnosis. Duodenal hematoma is a common injury in children following blunt abdominal trauma because the abdominal wall is thinner and less developed, making hollow viscus more prone to injury.

After a potential fistula is identified, management happens in three phases.","answers":[{"option":"Parenteral nutrition and pouch placement","explanation":"In the first phase of ECF management, which typically lasts 24–48 hours and involves keeping the patient nil per os, the priority is to treat any concomitant infection (e.g., peritonitis, sepsis) and electrolyte abnormalities. The second phase focuses on delineating the anatomy of the ECF via imaging (e.g., CT enterography) and managing the patient's nutritional needs, ECF output, and wound care. Because effluent from the ECF can be corrosive to skin, a pouch should be placed over the exit site to facilitate collection. Patients with low-output or moderate-output fistulas can be managed with enteral or oral feeding. This approach helps to stimulate intestinal motility, thereby preventing intestinal mucosal atrophy; it also helps patients avoid the risks and complications associated with parenteral nutrition (e.g., catheter-related bloodstream infection, metabolic complications). High-output ECFs (&gt; 500 mL/24 hours) are unlikely to heal spontaneously. Patients with a high-output ECF require parenteral nutrition to decrease the fistula output if the enteral feeding tube cannot be passed distal to the ECF. Total parenteral nutrition is indicated if there is evidence of intestinal obstruction on imaging or if the ECF output remains high despite a combination of parenteral and enteral feeding.\nMost low-output ECFs will close spontaneously after 5–6 weeks of conservative management. During this period, surgical repair of the ECF should be deferred because of the high risk of postoperative intestinal adhesions.

For such a patient, surgical repair of the ECF at this time increases the risk of postoperative adhesions. A more conservative line of management should be considered.","bool":false},{"option":"No change in management is indicated at this time","explanation":"Oral food intake can be continued in patients with an ECF that has low or decreasing output.

Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is an important risk factor for HCC.","answers":[{"option":"Integration of foreign DNA into host genome","explanation":"Integration of hepatitis B virus DNA into the host genome alters the expression of endogenous host genes important for cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. It also induces chromosomal instability. Although viral DNA integration occurs randomly, it often involves segments of genes encoding for key factors in carcinogenesis, such as p53, pRb, cyclins A and D1, and TGF beta.

The obstruction in this patient is most likely caused by which of the following structures?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The structure in question can compress the part of the duodenum lying between it and the aorta, leading to features of small bowel obstruction such as nausea, bilious vomiting, abdominal distention, and succussion splash (a sloshing sound heard on abdominal auscultation after moving the patient suddenly).","answers":[{"option":"Superior mesenteric artery","explanation":"The superior mesenteric artery passes anterior to the third segment of the duodenum (transverse duodenum), and the aorta is located directly posterior to this part of the intestine. Compression of the duodenum by this artery is called superior mesenteric artery syndrome. The classic presentation includes postprandial pain and bilious emesis following extreme weight loss.\nRapid weight loss causes shrinkage of the fat pad between the superior mesenteric artery and the duodenum, leading to compression of the intestinal lumen. Pediatric patients with congenitally abnormal arterial anatomy or those undergoing corrective surgery for scoliosis are also at risk.","bool":true},{"option":"Gallbladder","explanation":"The gallbladder empties into the second segment of the duodenum. Direct obstruction of the duodenum by an enlarged gallbladder is very unlikely and would not cause third segment obstruction. In the very rare event of a fistula between the gallbladder and the duodenum, a gallstone can enter the intestinal lumen and cause an obstruction, which is known as gallstone ileus. However, gallstone ileus most often manifests with obstruction at the ileocecal valve.","bool":false},{"option":"Common bile duct","explanation":"The common bile duct enters the second segment of the duodenum. Cholangiocarcinoma of the bile duct at its junction with the duodenum can cause obstruction of the duodenum. However, this would result in second segment obstruction, not the third segment obstruction seen in this patient. Additionally, bilious emesis would not be expected, as bile flow through the common bile duct would be severely reduced or blocked entirely.","bool":false},{"option":"Body of pancreas","explanation":"The distal second and proximal third segments of duodenum curve around the pancreas. Inflammation of the pancreas, e.g., in severe pancreatitis, or pancreatic mass effect, e.g., from a tumor, could lead to duodenal obstruction. However, this would be expected from a process involving the head of the pancreas. Because the body of the pancreas is not in close contact with the duodenum, a pathology in this area would be very unlikely to account for an obstruction of the intestinal lumen.","bool":false},{"option":"Inferior vena cava","explanation":"The inferior vena cava is located in the retroperitoneum where it passes posterior to the second and third segments of the duodenum and the pancreas. The inferior vena cava can easily be compressed due to its low intravascular pressure but is unlikely to cause obstruction of adjacent structures such as the duodenum.","bool":false},{"option":"Portal vein","explanation":"The portal vein arises from the confluence of the superior mesenteric and splenic vein posterior to the pancreas. It then travels superolaterally to the liver. It does not have contact with the duodenum and is not known to cause duodenal obstruction.","bool":false}]},{"id":356,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"\nA 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of fever, chills, abdominal pain, and profuse nonbloody diarrhea.

After the incubation period, patients usually develop a prodrome of fluctuating fever and malaise, relative bradycardia, and a change in bowel habits (e.g., constipation or diarrhea). The prodrome is then followed by the onset of persistently high fever, profuse diarrhea (pea-soup diarrhea), a salmon-colored maculopapular rash (rose spots), and hepatosplenomegaly. This patient also recently returned from an S. Typhi endemic region.\nS. Typhi is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, with the bacteria initially entering the host through intestinal Peyer patches. After a period of incubation (5–30 days), the organism enters the bloodstream and can seed several organs (e.g., the liver and spleen). Diagnosis is established based on blood and stool cultures, which become positive 1 and 2–3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Treatment comprises a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) or a fluoroquinolone. If left untreated, patients can develop gastrointestinal ulceration and/or perforation.

The causal organism is usually transmitted through contaminated water, and affected patients usually have a recent history of camping or exposure to fresh water. Fever, rash, and constitutional symptoms are not common features.","bool":false},{"option":"Escherichia coli","explanation":"\nEscherichia coli causes a spectrum of clinical entities that depend on the causative strain. Enteroinvasive E. coli causes a dysentery-like illness, with fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Enterotoxigenic E. coli causes traveler's diarrhea, which is characterized by watery diarrhea, with minimal constitutional symptoms. E. coli infections would not typically cause a rash or fluctuating fever.","bool":false},{"option":"Campylobacter jejuni","explanation":"\nCampylobacter jejuni is associated with a dysentery-like illness, with fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. It is a common cause of bloody diarrhea in children and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, contaminated food products (such as poultry or unpasteurized milk), and infected animals. Rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and profuse, watery diarrhea are not associated features.","bool":false},{"option":"Vibrio cholerae","explanation":"\nVibrio cholerae causes cholera, which can manifest with fever, malaise, and profuse diarrhea. However, the diarrhea is typically watery (known as rice-water stool) and has a rapid onset (0–2 days from infection) with no prodrome of constipation. In addition, rash and hepatosplenomegaly are not characteristic of cholera. Furthermore, although cholera is endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia, the risk of infection in Indonesia is low.","bool":false},{"option":"Yersinia enterocolitica","explanation":"\nYersinia enterocolitica causes diarrhea and usually appears after ingestion of spoiled meat. Patients typically present with low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; diarrhea may be bloody in some cases, and the duration of symptoms is variable. Patients may also develop symptoms that mimic appendicitis (pseudoappendicitis). While this patient does have fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly and a salmon-colored rash are not features of Yersinia infection, making this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Entamoeba histolytica","explanation":"\nEntamoeba histolytica causes amebiasis, which can manifest in a variety of symptoms depending on the severity of illness. Mild infections may take the form of loose stools and vague abdominal pain, whereas severe infections involve a dysentery-like syndrome characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. In the setting of amebic liver abscess, hepatosplenomegaly may be present, along with significant right upper quadrant pain. However, a rash would not be expected in amebiasis, making this diagnosis much less likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Clostridioides difficile","explanation":"\nClostridioides difficile causes pseudomembranous colitis, which is often considered a nosocomial infection, as it is strongly associated with recent broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure. Mild infections can manifest with bloody diarrhea alone, while more severe infections manifest with dysentery, crampy abdominal pain, and fever. However, this patient has no history of recent antibiotic use, and a rash and hepatosplenomegaly would not be expected in C. difficile infection, making this diagnosis unlikely.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Cryptosporidium parvum","explanation":"\nCryptosporidium parvum causes a form of self-limiting traveler's diarrhea in immunocompetent patients, with loose, profound watery stools and minimal constitutional symptoms. In immunosuppressed patients (classically patients with AIDS), it can cause potentially life-threatening diarrhea.

The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":4,"hint":"White plaques on the oral mucosa that can be scraped off are suggestive of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Further common findings include pain when eating, loss of taste, and a cottony feeling in the mouth. Candida albicans infections most commonly affect immunocompromised individuals, e.g., patients with hematologic malignancies.","answers":[{"option":"Topical nystatin","explanation":"\nTopical antifungal therapy (e.g., troches, mucoadhesive buccal tablets, pastilles) is considered first-line for most patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Preferred topical agents include clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin. Oral fluconazole is also used, most commonly in patients with moderate to severe symptoms.\nThe diagnosis of oropharyngeal candidiasis is most often clinical.

Porcelain gallbladder is often identified incidentally on abdominal imaging, although it may manifest with right upper quadrant pain, as seen in this patient. There is a small but significant risk of developing gallbladder adenocarcinoma, so the recommended treatment is cholecystectomy.","bool":true},{"option":"Gallbladder perforation","explanation":"Both porcelain gallbladder and gallbladder perforation are complications of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. Porcelain gallbladder itself is not a common cause of gallbladder perforation.","bool":false},{"option":"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma","explanation":"The two greatest risk factors for pancreatic cancer are smoking and chronic pancreatitis.

Inguinal hernias are subdivided by anatomical location: indirect inguinal hernias protrude laterally to the inferior epigastric vessels, and direct inguinal hernias protrude medially to the inferior epigastric vessels. This patient has an indirect inguinal hernia, the most common type of hernia. Indirect inguinal hernias protrude through the inguinal canal from the deep to the superficial inguinal ring. Possible complications of hernias include incarcerated hernia and strangulated hernia. Patients with uncomplicated inguinal hernias should be scheduled for elective surgical repair. Patients with complicated inguinal hernias must undergo emergency surgical repair to minimize the likelihood of progression to gangrene of the hernial contents.","bool":true},{"option":"Direct inguinal hernia","explanation":"\nDirect inguinal hernias manifest with lower abdominal pain and a palpable groin protrusion above the inguinal ligament that bulges during the Valsalva maneuver. However, direct inguinal hernias protrude medial to the inferior epigastric vessels (i.e., within the Hesselbach triangle), not lateral.

Which of the following is the most common cause of mortality in patients with the condition described here?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient has clinical findings consistent with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (abdominal distention, RLQ pain, and a RLQ mass), most likely due to abnormal chloride transmembrane transport.","answers":[{"option":"Pulmonary infection","explanation":"The nasal potential difference test conducted here confirms the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in this patient. Patients with cystic fibrosis have hyperviscous exocrine gland secretions, which can thicken stool and cause distal intestinal obstruction, as seen here. Hyperviscous respiratory secretions and deficient mucociliary clearance lead to recurrent pulmonary infections. This, combined with multiple episodes of antibiotic therapy, leads to the development of more severe, resistant infections (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and structural lung changes (e.g., bronchiectasis, emphysema), with eventual progression to respiratory failure.","bool":true},{"option":"Liver cirrhosis","explanation":"The liver is often affected in cystic fibrosis, with manifestations including cholestasis, hepatic steatosis, portal hypertension, and liver cirrhosis.

Enterohepatic circulation is impaired in patients with Crohn disease and ileocecal resection.","answers":[{"option":"Decreased biliary concentration of bile acids","explanation":"\nBile acids are normally reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and returned to the liver for reuse via the enterohepatic circulation. Bile acid malabsorption can occur in patients with Crohn disease as they are prone to developing ileitis or complications requiring terminal ileum resection, leading to a decreased concentration of bile acids in the bile. A decreased bile acid to cholesterol ratio causes cholesterol supersaturation and predisposes to cholesterol gallstone formation, which can lead to cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased motility of the gallbladder","explanation":"Decreased motility of the gallbladder can result in biliary stasis, which predisposes to gallstone development, as seen here. This patient's symptoms are likely caused by contraction of the gallbladder against an impacted stone (e.g., in the neck of the gallbladder), rather than by decreased motility of the gallbladder.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased bilirubin production","explanation":"Increased bilirubin production can be caused by hemolysis. The resulting unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia predisposes to the development of black pigment gallstones. However, this patient lacks clinical features of hemolysis (e.g., jaundice, fatigue, weakness).","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased fat absorption","explanation":"This patient likely has decreased fat absorption in the gut due to Crohn disease and ileal resection. Malabsorption of fatty acids leads to increased concentrations of fatty acids in the gut that then bind to calcium. Thus, calcium is not available to bind and aid in oxalate excretion, which leads to increased absorption of oxalate that results in hyperoxaluria. This predisposes to the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones, not gallstones.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased hepatic cholesterol secretion","explanation":"Increased hepatic cholesterol secretion can result in cholesterol supersaturation in the bile and precipitation of cholesterol gallstones. Increased hepatic cholesterol secretion can result from increased circulating estrogen levels (e.g., during pregnancy). Formation of cholesterol gallstones in patients with a history of Crohn disease and ileocecal resection is caused by a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased activity of β-glucuronidase","explanation":"Increased β-glucuronidase activity can occur due to β-glucuronidase production by bacteria in the biliary tract. Endogenous β-glucuronidase deconjugates bilirubin in the gut for reabsorption. Increased β-glucuronidase activity, therefore, results in excess bilirubin absorption and presence in the biliary tract as well as eventual precipitation with calcium to form brown pigment gallstones.

Radiographic evidence of colonic dilation (transverse colon &gt; 6 cm in diameter) is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Multiple air-fluid levels and loss of colonic haustration further indicate colonic dilation and paralytic ileus. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis are at risk of developing toxic megacolon, especially early in the disease course.\nInitial treatment is usually conservative and includes IV antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, complete bowel rest, nasogastric decompression, and IV steroids (for inflammatory bowel disease). If the patient does not improve within 24–72 hours, surgery may be required.","bool":true},{"option":"Double-contrast barium enema","explanation":"\nDouble-contrast barium enema is an imaging modality used in the investigation of undiagnosed ulcerative colitis because it can identify fine mucosal changes (e.g., microulcerations, pseudopolyps) that may be missed on other imaging modalities.

Gastric acid suppression therapy (e.g., with proton pump inhibitors) further increases the risk of developing this condition.","answers":[{"option":"Oral vancomycin","explanation":"\nOral vancomycin is a first-line therapy used to treat C. difficile infection (see “Antibiotic therapy for CDI in adults” table.). This condition typically manifests following antibiotic therapy (e.g., ciprofloxacin, as in this case), which destroys many gastrointestinal bacteria except for C. difficile, which is resistant to the most frequently used antibiotics. This selective advantage allows it to proliferate and cause infection. In addition to discontinuing the inciting antibiotic, management includes correction of fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances if needed, and contact precautions to prevent transmission. Oral fidaxomicin is another appropriate first-line therapy for C. difficile infection. Recent guidelines suggest fidaxomicin over vancomycin in patients with nonfulminant C. difficile infection. Metronidazole is a second-line therapy recommended when vancomycin and fidaxomicin are unavailable or contraindicated (e.g., due to allergy).\nC. difficile infection can be confirmed either by nucleic acid amplification testing for C. difficile toxin-producing genes alone or by enzyme immunoassays for both glutamate dehydrogenase and C. difficile toxin A and toxin B.

The hepatitis C antibody test is a screening test and is positive in cases of active, chronic, or previous infection. This patient last used IV illicit drugs 5 years ago and has been symptomatic for 3 months with clinical features of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, which suggests a chronic hepatitis C infection. The cutaneous erosions and blistering on the dorsum of this patient's hands are likely due to porphyria cutanea tarda, a common extrahepatic manifestation of chronic hepatitis C.

Ideally, dietary therapy should be coordinated with a dietician to prevent nutritional deficiencies. Patients should also carry an epinephrine autoinjector because accidental exposure to an eliminated food allergen may result in anaphylaxis.

Strongyloides stercoralis is transmitted by larval penetration of intact skin (usually when bare feet come into contact with contaminated soil). Larvae travel to the alveoli through the bloodstream (pulmonary phase), where they ascend the pulmonary system to the pharynx before being coughed up and swallowed. Once in the gastrointestinal tract, they develop into adult female worms and reproduce via parthenogenesis, with the eggs hatching as rhabditiform larvae.

In a patient with clinical features of acute cholecystitis (e.g., RUQ pain lasting over 6 hours, fever, and leukocytosis), ultrasonography of the RUQ is indicated. Findings that support the diagnosis include gallbladder wall thickening, gallbladder wall edema, obstructing gallstone, and/or sonographic Murphy sign. Gallstones are a common incidental finding on ultrasound but in this context would also be suggestive of acute cholecystitis. In uncomplicated cholecystitis, cholestasis parameters (ALP, GGT, and bilirubin) are typically normal or only mildly elevated because there is usually no obstruction of the hepatic ducts or common bile duct.","bool":true},{"option":"Dilated common bile duct with intrahepatic biliary dilatation","explanation":"The presence of a dilated common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary dilatation on ultrasound suggests choledocholithiasis.

These pseudocysts lack proper epithelial lining (in contrast to true cysts) and are instead walled off by adjacent intraperitoneal structures (e.g., stomach or omentum). Such lesions are due to a disruption of the pancreatic ductal system and extravasation of fluids, usually as a result of acute or chronic pancreatitis. Most pseudocysts remain asymptomatic but large lesions can cause mass effect, resulting in abdominal pain, biliary obstruction, and potentially gastrointestinal bleeds if nearby blood vessels are involved.","bool":true},{"option":"Pyogenic membrane","explanation":"\nPyogenic membranes form the outer wall of abscesses, enclosing pus and bacteria. Pancreatic abscesses typically occur as a complication of acute pancreatitis, whereby leakage of pancreatic enzymes leads to surrounding tissue necrosis that is subsequently infected.

An increase in the production of stomach acid can also occur in a number of scenarios related to increased stress (e.g., critically ill patients, ventilator dependency). However, a more specific etiology is likely responsible for this patient's gastrointestinal bleeding following severe burn injuries.","bool":false},{"option":"Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole","explanation":"Damage to a tortuous submucosal arteriole describes the pathophysiology of a Dieulafoy lesion, which can also cause sudden, severe gastrointestinal bleeding. However, Dieulafoy lesion is a very rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding and is not associated with extensive burns.","bool":false},{"option":"Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum","explanation":"Infection with H. pylori is estimated to affect two-thirds of the world's population and is a risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, and gastrointestinal malignancies. Although the mechanism underlying this association is not entirely understood, chronic infection with H. pylori disrupts the physiology of the stomach mucosa, leading to increased stomach acid secretion and decreased expression of protective factors such as mucin. Although it is very possible that this patient's stomach was colonized by H. pylori, sudden gastrointestinal bleeding occurring after extensive burns suggests a different cause.","bool":false}]},{"id":389,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"\nA previously healthy 12-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of abdominal pain and vomiting.

This patient has none of these clinical features, does not have radiographic signs of pneumatosis intestinalis, and is not a premature newborn.","bool":false},{"option":"Flexible sigmoidoscopy","explanation":"\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy is used in children with abdominal pain and/or chronic diarrhea when a diagnosis is unclear. However, this patient's clinical presentation and ultrasound findings indicate intussusception, so another step in management is more appropriate at this point.","bool":false},{"option":"Air enema","explanation":"\nAir enema is the treatment of choice for intussusception. This procedure creates pressure within the intestine and pushes the bowel back into its normal position. Hydrostatic enema is a viable alternative (the mechanism is the same, only normal saline is used instead of air). After the procedure, the patient should be monitored for 24 hours, because intussusception often recurs during that time frame.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Pyloromyotomy","explanation":"\nPyloromyotomy is the standard treatment for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), which can manifest with nonbilious vomiting.

The majority of patients are asymptomatic, but if symptoms are present, hematochezia is the most common. The intussusception diagnosed in this child, especially in light of the reddish bowel movements, could indeed be the result of a Meckel diverticulum. However, regardless of the etiology of the intussusception, treatment needs to be initiated quickly and should not be delayed by further diagnostic studies.","bool":false},{"option":"Appendectomy","explanation":"\nAppendectomy is the treatment of choice in acute appendicitis, which occurs rarely in the first year of life. Acute appendicitis may manifest with fever, vomiting, irritability, diarrhea, and tenderness and guarding of the abdomen. Ultrasound in appendicitis typically shows a dilated appendix with edematous walls. Appendicitis can mimic the target sign appearance of intussusception, especially in axial views, and if the appendix is already perforated. On longitudinal views, it is usually possible to differentiate intussusception and appendicitis, because the appendix is a blind-ending sac. Additionally, in axial views, the appendiceal lumen is usually filled with hypoechogenic fluid or debris, whereas the typical finding in intussusception is alternating echogenicity due to intussuscepted bowel mucosa.","bool":false}]},{"id":390,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"\nA 52-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of progressive lethargy, shortness of breath, and difficulty concentrating.

These patients are also at increased risk for gastric carcinoid tumor as a result of chronic hypergastrinemia, which induces gastric cell hyperplasia.","bool":true},{"option":"Colorectal carcinoma","explanation":"A history of smoking is a risk factor for colorectal carcinoma, and patients with colorectal cancer may present with anemia (due to chronic GI hemorrhage). However, chronic GI hemorrhage typically results in iron-deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia) rather than pernicious anemia (macrocytic anemia). There is currently no clear evidence that patients with pernicious anemia are at an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Pancreatic carcinoma","explanation":"Although this patient's history of smoking is a risk factor for pancreatic carcinoma, the presence of pernicious anemia significantly increases his risk of another disease. Studies have shown that there is no statistically significant association between pernicious anemia and pancreatic carcinoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Celiac disease","explanation":"Patients with celiac disease may also present with symptoms of B12 deficiency due to malabsorption. However, if the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency was malabsorption due to celiac disease, urinary excretion of radiolabeled B12 would not normalize after repeating the Schilling test with orally administered intrinsic factor (IF). This patient's increased absorption of B12 with oral IF on the Schilling test is diagnostic of pernicious anemia. Because pernicious anemia and celiac disease are both autoimmune diseases, there could theoretically be an association between the two. However, there is currently little evidence to suggest a clear association.","bool":false},{"option":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus","explanation":"Patients with type 2 DM are at increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency for multiple reasons, the most significant being metformin use because metformin affects the calcium-dependent ileal absorption of the intrinsic factor-B12 complex.

This patient has the typical features of liver injury, including ecchymoses over the right chest, pain in the right upper quadrant and the right chest, referred pain to the right shoulder (due to diaphragmatic irritation), and hemodynamic instability. After stabilizing this patient, a focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) should be performed to assess for free fluid in the abdomen.","bool":true},{"option":"Pneumothorax","explanation":"\nPneumothorax may occur secondary to blunt chest trauma such as falls. It manifests with dyspnea and ipsilateral chest pain, as well as hemodynamic instability in the case of tension pneumothorax (due to mediastinal compression and decreased venous return). However, the physical examination in patients with pneumothorax typically shows reduced or absent breath sounds over the affected lung. Tension pneumothorax would also manifest with jugular venous distention rather than the flat neck veins seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Small bowel perforation","explanation":"\nSmall bowel perforation is a possible sequela of blunt abdominal trauma such as this patient's fall. While penetrating trauma may lead to immediate bowel injury and intestinal leakage, blunt abdominal trauma typically results in necrosis and delayed perforation after several days, making the diagnosis unlikely in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Splenic laceration","explanation":"The spleen is one of the most commonly injured organs during blunt abdominal trauma.

Long-term use of NSAIDs increases the risk for gastroduodenal ulcers but may also partially obscure associated symptoms. Untreated peptic ulcer disease is often complicated by gastric or duodenal perforation, which typically manifests with severe, acute abdominal pain and distention if the ulcer freely perforates into the abdominal cavity. If, however, the ulcer penetrates into an adjacent organ, an abscess may form, manifesting with nonspecific subacute symptoms (e.g., fever, anorexia, leukocytosis), as seen here. Because of its close proximity to the liver, this patient's penetrating duodenal ulcer has caused a hepatic abscess, as evidenced on ultrasound.\nIn addition to treatment for peptic ulcer disease (e.g., discontinuation of naproxen, alcohol consumption, smoking; H. pylori eradication; proton pump inhibitors), this patient should receive IV antibiotics and undergo percutaneous drainage of his liver abscess.","bool":true},{"option":"Echinococcus granulosus","explanation":"Infection with Echinococcus granulosus can cause hepatic cysts that may result in abdominal pain, which is usually located in the right upper quadrant, and vomiting.

Although this patient's history of illicit drug use and sexual activity puts him at risk of both HBV and HCV infections, he has no signs or symptoms of cirrhosis (e.g., parenchymal fibrosis on ultrasound, jaundice, ascites). Finally, in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, gastrointestinal bleeding is unlikely in the absence of cirrhosis. ","bool":false},{"option":"Acute pancreatitis","explanation":"\nAcute pancreatitis can manifest with abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, fever, and, if severe, leukocytosis. However, abdominal pain associated with pancreatitis is typically exacerbated rather than relieved by food intake. Gastrointestinal bleeding may occur as a complication of this condition, but would most commonly result in hemodynamic instability. Finally, acute pancreatitis does not account for this patient's liver abscess on abdominal ultrasound. ","bool":false},{"option":"Diverticulitis","explanation":"Patients with diverticulitis may present with abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, leukocytosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the pain in diverticulitis does not improve with eating and is typically located in the left lower quadrant as the sigmoid colon is most commonly involved. Moreover, diverticulitis is predominantly a disease in older adults and does not typically affect individuals under 40 years of age. Although abscess formation is a common complication of diverticulitis, the abscess would typically be peridiverticular (commonly near the sigmoid colon) rather than hepatic.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute appendicitis","explanation":"\nPain due to appendicitis is usually located in the right lower quadrant, does not improve with eating, and is not associated with gastrointestinal bleeding.

Diagnosis is confirmed on abdominal CT imaging, which can show pancreatic calcifications, ductal strictures, and ductal dilatation. A “chain of lakes” appearance can sometimes be seen, which is caused by the alternating dilation and stricture of the main pancreatic duct.

The investigation is usually only performed intraoperatively after other diagnoses have been ruled out and findings from other imaging modalities have supported the diagnosis of BA. In patients with suspected BA following clinical and laboratory evaluation, abdominal ultrasound is initially indicated to rule out other causes of biliary obstruction (e.g., choledochal cysts). Supportive findings of BA include the absence of a gallbladder and no dilation of the biliary tree. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy can also be considered to assess the patency of the biliary tree. Liver biopsy is usually performed to exclude other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis (e.g., Alagille syndrome) and to identify changes consistent with BA, such as active inflammation with bile duct degeneration and fibrosis, portal stromal edema, and bile duct proliferation.

She describes her stools as greasy, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush. During this time she has had a 6-kg (13.2-lb) weight loss. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Physical examination shows pallor and cheilitis. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 11 g/dL. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":3,"hint":"D-xylose is a monosaccharide that is directly absorbed by the small intestinal mucosa without enzymatic breakdown and is primarily excreted via urine. After consumption of d-xylose, urinary levels of this monosaccharide typically increase. Loss of absorptive capacity of the small intestinal mucosa leads to a low urinary d-xylose concentration, known as a positive d-xylose test.","answers":[{"option":"Hypersensitivity to gliadin","explanation":"\nHypersensitivity to gliadin is the underlying cause of celiac disease, which manifests with steatorrhea, weight loss, and features of iron deficiency (pallor and cheilitis). Global malabsorption, confirmed by a positive d-xylose test (carbohydrate malabsorption), high fecal fat content (fat malabsorption), and low hemoglobin (micronutrient malabsorption), are typical of celiac disease. A d-xylose test that remains positive after a course of antibiotics indicates a noninfectious cause of malabsorption.\nThe gold standard for diagnosing celiac disease is the measurement of serum IgA anti‑tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG) and total IgA. If total IgA is normal and IgA tTG is high, an endoscopy-guided intestinal biopsy should be obtained (while the patient is still on a diet that contains gluten) to confirm the diagnosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Autoimmune-mediated inflammation of the colon","explanation":"Autoimmune-mediated inflammation of the colon is the underlying mechanism of ulcerative colitis (UC), which can manifest with recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, anemia, and weight loss. UC most frequently occurs in individuals 15–35 years of age. However, because the small intestine is not usually affected in UC, the absorption of nutrients here remains unchanged. Therefore, steatorrhea would be absent and urine d-xylose concentration would be normal.

This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional conditions?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The image shows black pigment gallstones.","answers":[{"option":"Chronic hemolytic anemia","explanation":"\nBlack pigment gallstones are associated with chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., due to hereditary spherocytosis or beta thalassemia major), in which an elevated red blood cell breakdown leads to an increased serum concentration of indirect bilirubin. Excess bilirubin is excreted by the liver into the bile. The excess bilirubin then precipitates within the gallbladder due to supersaturation and reacts with calcium salts to form black calcium bilirubinate stones. Black pigment stones account for approx. 10% of all gallstones.","bool":true},{"option":"Menopausal symptoms","explanation":"\nExogenous estrogen therapy used to treat menopausal symptoms can lead to an increased risk of cholesterol gallstones because estrogen induces the production and secretion of cholesterol by the liver. Most of this excess cholesterol is excreted into the bile, and this process causes a supersaturation that predisposes to gallstone formation. However, cholesterol gallstones are typically yellowish green in color, not black as seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Diabetes mellitus","explanation":"Patients with diabetes mellitus appear to be at increased risk of gallstone formation. This increased risk is due to hypertriglyceridemia and gallbladder hypomotility with biliary stasis, which is caused by autonomic neuropathy. However, diabetes mellitus typically predisposes to cholesterol stones that are yellowish-green in color, not black as seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Morbid obesity","explanation":"\nObesity has been strongly associated with an increased risk of gallbladder disease.

He has hypertension, hypercholesteremia, and a left bundle branch block that was diagnosed 5 years ago. The patient's mother died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70 years, and his father died of aortic dissection at the age of 65 years. The patient smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 10 years ago. He drinks three beers daily. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, atorvastatin, and pantoprazole. The patient appears to be in mild distress.

The combination of these findings suggests iatrogenic esophageal perforation.","answers":[{"option":"Contrast esophagography with gastrografin","explanation":"\nIatrogenic trauma is the most common etiology of esophageal perforation (e.g., following upper endoscopy). While this patient's x-ray findings and Hamman sign already suggest pneumomediastinum, gastrografin contrast esophagography is indicated as a confirmatory test to visualize the potential defect and assess its size and exact location. Gastrografin is preferred over barium as a contrast agent because it is water-soluble and less irritating; extravasation of barium may cause mediastinitis and subsequent fibrosis. There is no free air under the diaphragms on CXR, thus gastric perforation is unlikely.\nIf Boerhaave syndrome is suspected, a chest x-ray is conducted first, which may show lucency from mediastinal and/or subcutaneous air. While gastrografin contrast esophagography is usually the preferred confirmatory test, there may be false negatives in up to 20% of cases. The ease of a CT scan has made CT a popular alternative in hemodynamically unstable patients and/or if x-ray and contrast esophagogram are inconclusive. In a patient with esophageal perforation, the CT may demonstrate intramural swelling/hematoma and periesophageal air collections tracking into the surrounding tissues.","bool":true},{"option":"Contrast-enhanced CT of the aorta","explanation":"A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the aorta can be used to evaluate for aortic pathologies (e.g., aortic dissection). Although this patient has several risk factors for aortic dissection (e.g., hypertension, smoking) and tearing pain that radiates to his back, mediastinal emphysema would not be an expected finding in a patient with aortic dissection. Also, patients with aortic dissection often have asymmetrical blood pressure and pulse readings between the limbs. This patient's symptoms after upper endoscopy suggest another diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Coronary angiography","explanation":"\nCoronary angiography may be indicated in the workup of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) if elevated troponins confirm a myocardial infarction. As this patient's troponin level is normal despite epigastric pain lasting over one day, a myocardial infarction that might warrant coronary angiography is very unlikely. Additionally, ACS would not explain the mediastinal emphysema present on examination.","bool":false},{"option":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","explanation":"\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be delayed in this patient with suspected iatrogenic esophageal perforation as the endoscope and/or air insufflation may cause further dissection of the perforation. If an esophageal rupture is suspected, diagnostic endoscopy is reserved for patients with a poorly localized esophageal perforation on standard imaging and in whom endoscopic treatment is indicated. EGD should be considered if this patient's symptoms of burning epigastric pain were due to worsening gastritis – however, mediastinal emphysema is highly suggestive of esophageal perforation. If esophageal perforation is suspected during upper endoscopy (not on the next day, as in this patient), careful endoscopic inspection without insufflation is warranted to localize the esophageal defect.","bool":false},{"option":"Abdominal ultrasound","explanation":"Abdominal ultrasound is the most useful initial test for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Although this patient's radiating upper abdominal pain and history of alcohol use may suggest acute pancreatitis, his normal lipase level makes pancreatic involvement highly unlikely. In addition, pancreatitis does not explain subcutaneous emphysema present on exam. An abdominal ultrasound would have limited utility in establishing the diagnosis in this case.","bool":false},{"option":"Barium swallow","explanation":"Although a barium swallow is commonly used to detect changes of the esophageal wall (e.g., strictures, dilations, neoplastic growths), water-insoluble barium entering the mediastinum through a perforation (e.g., traumatic perforation, as suspected in this patient, Boerhaave syndrome) can induce inflammation, causing mediastinitis and subsequent mediastinal fibrosis.

This patient's travel history, acute onset of 'rice water' stool, signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, tachycardia, and arterial hypotension), and stool studies are consistent with Vibrio cholera infection.","answers":[{"option":"Luminal chloride hypersecretion due to overactivation of adenylate cyclase","explanation":"\nCholera toxin activates the Gs α subunit, thereby stimulating adenylate cyclase activity to increase cAMP within the intestinal epithelial cells. Increased cAMP concentration overactivates cytosolic PKA, which phosphorylates CFTR chloride channel proteins, causing excess secretion of Cl- (and subsequently water, Na+, K+, and HCO3-). This process leads to watery, greyish stools and severe dehydration, as seen in this patient. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is the mainstay of treatment to replenish intravascular volume because, in diarrheal disease, neutral NaCl absorption and electrogenic Na+ absorption are disrupted, while coupled absorption of Na+ and glucose via sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT 1) is preserved. Glucose enhances electrolytes and water absorption, which makes ORT so effective.","bool":true},{"option":"Fluid and electrolyte loss due to inflammation of luminal surface epithelium","explanation":"Inflammation of the luminal epithelium is seen in exudative-inflammatory diarrhea caused by IBD or bacterial infections with Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E.coli.

Biopsies from the gastric antrum are therefore most likely to yield an accurate diagnosis because atrophic changes and H. pylori infection load is greatest at this site. Gastric MALToma is a potential complication of H. pylori infection. In contrast to H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis, the gastric fundus and body are primarily affected in autoimmune atrophic gastritis, which can present similarly but the urea breath test would be negative and other features suggestive of autoimmune disease (e.g., pernicious anemia, vitiligo, autoimmune thyroiditis) would usually be present. Patients with atrophic gastritis have decreased gastric acid secretion (hypochlorhydria) with a secondary increase in gastrin levels.\nPersistent dyspepsia in a patient over 55 years of age mandates evaluation with an upper endoscopy, even in the absence of alarm symptoms (dysphagia, unintentional weight loss, hematemesis, or melena), to rule out malignant lesions.","bool":true},{"option":"Duodenal bulb","explanation":"The duodenal bulb is a common location for duodenal ulcers, which are often associated with H. pylori infection.

Both viral and individual host factors (e.g., genetic polymorphisms) contribute to the overall risk of viral persistence. Up to one-third of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop liver cirrhosis within 20 years. As chronic hepatitis C and even liver cirrhosis are frequently asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms until late stages, diagnosis and treatment are often delayed.\nIn contrast to acute hepatitis C infection, only a minority of patients with acute hepatitis B infection (5–10%) will develop chronic hepatitis B. On the other hand, approx. 90% of infants with perinatally acquired hepatitis B infection will develop chronic hepatitis B and only 5–15% of infants with perinatally acquired hepatitis C will develop chronic hepatitis C.

Because this patient's age, weight loss, and alcohol use are concerning for gastric cancer, upper endoscopy is the diagnostic test of choice. In cases of suspected malignant GOO, endoscopic evaluation with a biopsy is required to obtain a histological diagnosis. Endoscopy can also provide short-term treatment with stent placement or dilation.\nUntil the late 1970s, most cases of GOO were caused by peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The declining prevalence of H. pylori infection and the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in the treatment of PUD have significantly decreased the incidence of GOO due to PUD.

Coughing during meals indicating potential aspiration and regurgitation of undigested food are both suggestive of the underlying mechanism.","answers":[{"option":"Outpouching of the hypopharynx","explanation":"\nOutpouching of the hypopharynx describes a Zenker diverticulum, the most common type of esophageal diverticula. It is seen mostly in middle-aged and older patients presenting with dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration of undigested food, and foul-smelling breath. Zenker diverticulum is commonly complicated by recurrent aspiration pneumonia, caused by swallowed saliva, liquid, or food entering the airway, as seen in this patient.","bool":true},{"option":"Unrestricted growth of pneumocytes with invasion of the surrounding tissue","explanation":"Unrestricted growth of pneumocytes with invasion of the surrounding tissue describes lung cancer. This patient presents with some features of lung cancer, such as cough, weakness, and a history of tobacco abuse – the most important risk factor. However, lung cancer is not commonly associated with regurgitation of undigested food and does not adequately explain the relationship between the cough and food intake.\nAlthough postobstructive pneumonia, which may be a manifestation of undiagnosed lung cancer, cannot be entirely excluded in this patient, aspiration-induced pneumonia seems more likely given that food regurgitation is also mentioned.","bool":false},{"option":"Uncoordinated contractions of the esophagus","explanation":"Uncoordinated contractions of the esophagus suggest esophageal spasm.

The regurgitation of undigested food is suggestive of another underlying etiology.","bool":false},{"option":"Weak tone of the lower esophageal sphincter","explanation":"Weak tone of the lower esophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal reflux, which may explain this patient's retrosternal discomfort during meals and is a predisposing factor for (recurrent) aspiration pneumonia, but it does not explain the regurgitation of chunks of undigested food. Additionally, the patient is currently taking pantoprazole, which would be expected to provide symptomatic relief of gastroesophageal reflux.","bool":false},{"option":"Formation of a tissue cavity containing necrotic debris","explanation":"Formation of a tissue cavity containing necrotic debris indicates a lung abscess. Although a lung abscess would be consistent with the patient's history of recurrent pneumonia, it does not explain his retrosternal discomfort or his cough during meals. While aspiration of food or saliva may be the cause of a lung abscess, regurgitation of undigested food is not one of its symptoms.","bool":false}]},{"id":438,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 28-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug use is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of fatigue, yellow eyes, confusion, and blood in her stools.

Her history of intravenous drug use puts her at risk of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is an enveloped partially double-stranded DNA virus. The presence of virions with a single-stranded RNA genome and an envelope with lipoproteins identical to those in HBV virus indicates that the patient is concurrently infected with the hepatitis D virus.","answers":[{"option":"Deltavirus","explanation":"\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) are transmitted sexually, parenterally (e.g., contaminated shared needles), or perinatally. Acute HBV infection is usually mild or asymptomatic and resolves within a few weeks or months. However, 5% of adult patients will develop chronic HBV infection. HDV, on the other hand, is a defective virus that is dependent on the HBsAg coat of HBV for entry into hepatocytes. Therefore, HDV can only cause infection if simultaneous infection with HBV occurs or if the patient already has a chronic HBV infection. Simultaneous infection of HBV with HDV usually has a protracted course but superinfection by HDV in a patient with pre-existing HBV infection often has a rapid course characterized by fulminant hepatic failure, as seen here.","bool":true},{"option":"Picornavirus","explanation":"\nPicornaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses and include the hepatitis A virus (HAV), which would cause acute hepatitis.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is a flavivirus, can cause acute hepatitis. Also, coinfection of HBV (a double-stranded DNA virus) with HCV can occur because both HCV and HBV are transmitted via contaminated needles, and the risk of fulminant hepatic failure due to acute HCV hepatitis is increased if the patient has an underlying HBV infection. However, flaviviruses and HBV do not share an identical envelope.","bool":false},{"option":"Hepevirus","explanation":"\nHepeviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses.

This complication is most frequently seen in obese individuals &lt; 50 years of age. Because the gall bladder is a reservoir for bile, its removal results in constant drainage of bile acids into the bowel, which induces fluid secretion and increases mucosal permeability in the colon. Bile acid resins (e.g., cholestyramine), which bind the excess bile acids, are the treatment of choice.","bool":true},{"option":"Perform ileocolonoscopy with biopsy","explanation":"\nIleocolonoscopy with biopsy can be useful in confirming inflammatory bowel disease, which often manifests with abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea.

VIPomas are usually solitary and occur in the pancreatic tail. VIPoma can occur sporadically (&gt; 95% of cases) or as part of the MEN1. VIPoma syndrome is caused by the excessive secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) by the tumor. This results in excess fluid and electrolyte secretion into the lumen, leading to secretory diarrhea and hypokalemia. VIP also inhibits gastric acid secretion, leading to achlorhydria. Reduced gastric acid can lead to iron and vitamin B12 malabsorption, which can result in anemia, as seen in this patient. The hyperglycemia often noted in patients with WDHA syndrome is secondary to enhanced glycogenolysis caused by the effect of high portal vein VIP signaling on the liver.","bool":true},{"option":"Hyperinsulinemia","explanation":"\nHyperinsulinemia can be seen in the case of insulinomas, which would arise in the pancreas and can occur as a part of MEN1 syndrome.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms may also occur. Other symptoms include abdominal pain and angular cheilitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Cholelithiasis","explanation":"\nCholelithiasis is a finding associated with somatostatinomas, which would arise in the pancreas and can present with weight loss, diarrhea, and glucose intolerance. However, diarrhea in a patient with a somatostatinoma is typically caused by fat malabsorption. Therefore, stools would be foul-smelling (steatorrhea), unlike the odorless watery diarrhea in this patient. Moreover, somatostatinomas are among the least common pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in patients with MEN1 syndrome. They are more commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen disease).","bool":false},{"option":"Episodic hypertension","explanation":"Episodic hypertension is associated with pheochromocytomas. Pheochromocytoma can occur in conjunction with hypercalcemia in patients with MEN2A.

Although the underlying mechanism of NASH is not fully understood, insulin resistance is believed to play a major role in hepatic lipid accumulation. Adipokines released from fat deposits decrease the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissue, which causes postprandial hyperglycemia and a consequent increase in insulin secretion. This hyperinsulinemia triggers lipid uptake as well as lipogenesis within hepatocytes (nonalcoholic steatosis). The precursors of triglycerides (e.g., fatty acids, glycerols) and the byproducts of lipid metabolism can cause hepatocellular damage (NASH) by inducing oxidative stress. Chronic hepatocellular damage eventually leads to cirrhosis and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.\nNASH is only diagnosed in patients with no history of heavy alcohol use and after other causes of chronic liver disease have been ruled out. Besides obesity, major risk factors for developing NASH include diabetes mellitus (this patient's elevated HbA1c of 6.3% indicates prediabetes) and hypertriglyceridemia.

Maternal use of vasoconstrictive drugs (e.g., cocaine, MDMA, or cigarettes) increases the risk for this malformation.\nIntestinal atresia of any origin is suggested by a prenatal history of polyhydramnios, since the fetus cannot drink the amniotic fluid due to the intestinal obstruction.","bool":true},{"option":"Duodenal atresia","explanation":"\nDuodenal atresia can manifest with abdominal distention, bilious emesis, and a prenatal history of polyhydramnios. However, abdominal x-ray would show a double bubble sign rather than the triple bubble sign seen here. In about a third of cases, duodenal atresia is associated with chromosomal abnormalities, especially Down syndrome, of which there are no signs (i.e., dysmorphic features) in this patient. Finally, maternal use of a vasoconstrictive drug (tobacco) during pregnancy makes another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Hirschsprung disease","explanation":"\nHirschsprung disease can manifest with abdominal distention and bilious emesis secondary to obstruction from an aganglionic portion of the rectosigmoid colon. Failure to pass meconium for &gt; 48 hours and a positive squirt sign would support this diagnosis. This patient is still within the expected time frame for meconium passage, however, and his gasless distal abdomen on x-ray suggests a bowel obstruction more proximal than the rectosigmoid colon. Dilated loops of the large bowel would be expected in Hirschsprung disease.","bool":false},{"option":"Necrotizing enterocolitis","explanation":"\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) can manifest with abdominal distention and emesis. However, patients in the early stages of NEC also have diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and abdominal tenderness. Furthermore, this newborn lacks pneumatosis intestinalis on abdominal x-ray, which would confirm NEC. Lastly, NEC is most common in premature infants and usually occurs 2–4 weeks after birth, once oral feeding has been started. It would be rare for NEC to manifest within the first few hours of life.","bool":false},{"option":"Meconium ileus","explanation":"\nMeconium ileus can manifest with abdominal distention and bilious emesis due to ileal obstruction from the impacted stool. This diagnosis should be suspected if meconium fails to pass within the first 48 hours of life, whereas this newborn is only 6 hours old. Abdominal x-ray would show dilated loops of the small bowel above the terminal ileum, and rectal enema would reveal a microcolon. This infant's abdominal x-ray shows an obstruction more proximal to the ileum.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis","explanation":"\nHypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) can manifest with abdominal distention and emesis due to obstruction at the pylorus and maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and male sex are risk factors for the development of IHPS. However, the emesis is non-bilious and projectile and will not present until the pylorus has had time to hypertrophy several weeks after birth. A palpable, olive-shaped mass is also usually present, and abdominal x-ray will show distention of the stomach only. This infant's bilious emesis, age, and triple bubble sign suggest another diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Malrotation with volvulus","explanation":"\nMalrotation with volvulus can manifest with abdominal distention and bilious emesis due to intestinal obstruction from twisting of the bowel. Infants with midgut volvulus are usually acutely ill and present with hemodynamic instability and, in the case of perforation, signs of peritonitis (e.g., abdominal rigidity). Plain abdominal x-ray may be completely normal, reveal a double bubble sign (indicating duodenal obstruction), or demonstrate pneumoperitoneum (indicating perforation). This patient's history of polyhydramnios and triple bubble sign on x-ray suggest a different diagnosis.","bool":false}]},{"id":445,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 59-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea that began 12 hours ago.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient has food poisoning caused by a spore-forming gram-positive rod.","answers":[{"option":"Ingestion of preformed cereulide toxin","explanation":"\nImproperly refrigerated and reheated starch-containing food (e.g., rice) is a common source of emetic Bacillus cereus food poisoning. B. cereus can form spores, which are heat-resistant and survive the cooking process. If the food is cooled too slowly or improperly refrigerated after cooking, these spores can germinate and produce cereulide, a heat-resistant emetic toxin that causes nausea and vomiting, and/or a heat-labile diarrheal toxin that causes diarrhea. Food poisoning caused by the ingestion of preformed enterotoxins (e.g., from B. cereus and S. aureus) leads to the rapid onset of symptoms within minutes to hours, as seen here.\nIn comparison, food poisoning caused by bacteria that produce enterotoxins inside the intestines (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli, V. cholerae) has a delayed onset (hours to days after ingestion) and typically manifests with watery diarrhea.

Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient has dysphagia to solids and liquids and his esophagogram shows a corkscrew or rosary bead appearance. These findings are suggestive of distal esophageal spasm (DES).","answers":[{"option":"Simultaneous multi-peak contractions on esophageal manometry","explanation":"\nSimultaneous multi-peak contractions on esophageal manometry are the characteristic finding of DES. Repetitive nonperistaltic, nonprogressive contractions impede the progression of solid and liquid foods down the esophagus, which classically leads to dysphagia and squeezing retrosternal chest pain, as seen in this patient. Symptoms and relieving factors (nitrates) of DES can closely resemble those of cardiac pathology. Therefore, acute coronary syndrome should always be ruled out before considering a gastrointestinal disorder.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Significant ST-segment depression on exercise stress test","explanation":"\nCardiac exercise stress test is used for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with anginal symptoms. If the patient has coronary artery disease (CAD), the atherosclerotic plaque would prevent sufficient blood required to meet the increased oxygen requirements from reaching the myocardium and thus show ST-segment depression on ECG. Although retrosternal chest pain that radiates to the back and relieves nitrates could be caused by CAD, such events would be independent of eating or drinking and more likely be triggered by exertion. Additionally, other features like palpitations, sweating, and dyspnea would likely also be present. CAD would not explain this patient's esophagogram results, which indicate DES.\n","bool":false},{"option":"High lower esophageal sphincter pressure on esophageal manometry","explanation":"High lower esophageal sphincter pressure on esophageal manometry is diagnostic of achalasia, which presents with progressive difficulty swallowing, retrosternal chest pain, and a foreign body sensation in the esophagus. However, this patient's sudden onset of symptoms while eating is not typical for achalasia. Also, the esophagogram findings in this patient are more consistent with DES.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Esophageal manometry shows hypertensive contractions","explanation":"Hypertensive contractions on esophageal manometry are consistent with hypertension peristalsis (nutcracker esophagus). Although this patient's chest pain while eating could suggest this diagnosis, the presence of diffuse, uncoordinated spasms with segmentation on esophagogram are more consistent with DES.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Mass at the gastroesophageal junction on ultrasonography","explanation":"A mass at the gastroesophageal junction on ultrasonography is suspicious for esophageal cancer. Patients typically present with dysphagia (for solids at first and liquids later), regurgitation, and systemic manifestations such as weight loss, fatigue, and anemia. This patient does not have systemic manifestations and esophagogram findings are more consistent with DES than esophageal cancer. If a mass were present, it would be seen as a narrowed asymmetrical lumen in the lower esophagus on esophagogram.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated CK-MB levels on serum studies","explanation":"Elevated CK-MB levels on serum studies are consistent with myocardial infarction. Although this patient has retrosternal chest pain radiating to the back, he lacks other symptoms like dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, and typical findings on ECG. Furthermore, esophagogram results are consistent with DES.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Multiple mucosal erosions on endoscopy","explanation":"Multiple mucosal erosions on endoscopy are consistent with reflux esophagitis caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This condition can cause retrosternal pain that radiates to the back and, in some cases, dysphagia as seen in this patient. However, additional symptoms like regurgitation and nausea would also be present. Furthermore, in GERD, esophagogram may show strictures, ulcers, and gastric hernias due to gastroesophageal reflux, whereas the multiple areas of diffuse, uncoordinated spasms with segmentation seen in this patient are more consistent with DES.","bool":false}]},{"id":462,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 6-week-old male infant is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of recurrent nonbilious vomiting.

Male infants are more commonly affected. Projectile, nonbilious vomiting is the most common finding. Abdominal ultrasound is used to confirm the diagnosis and usually shows an elongated and thickened pylorus. The treatment of choice in patients with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is Ramstedt pyloromyotomy, in which a longitudinal muscle-splitting incision is made in the hypertrophic sphincter, without injury to the mucosa.","bool":true},{"option":"Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray","explanation":"A double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray is seen in patients with duodenal atresia. Patients with duodenal atresia typically present with signs of obstruction, including a distended upper abdomen, delayed meconium passage, and vomiting. Almost one-third of duodenal atresia cases are associated with chromosomal abnormalities, especially Down syndrome. This patient has Down syndrome and also presents with vomiting, but he does not have a distended upper abdomen or delayed meconium passage. Instead, he has an epigastric mass, which makes another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Episodes of decreased pH on esophageal pH monitoring","explanation":"Episodes of decreased pH on esophageal pH monitoring are seen in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

It is also seen in patients with diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) secondary to multiple contractions in the distal esophagus. Patients with volvulus usually present during the first two months of life with bilious vomiting and feeding intolerance. This patient's presentation of nonbilious vomiting and epigastric mass makes the diagnosis of volvulus unlikely. DES rarely affects children and while it may also present with food refusal and vomiting, it would not be associated with a palpable epigastric mass.","bool":false},{"option":"Pseudokidney sign on abdominal ultrasound","explanation":"A pseudokidney sign on abdominal ultrasound is seen in patients with intussusception. Intussusception most commonly occurs in infants aged 3–12 months and presents with acute cyclical abdominal pain, knees drawn to the chest, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Although this patient presents with vomiting, he is only 6 weeks old and does not have any other symptoms, making intussusception unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray","explanation":"A dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray is seen in patients with Hirschsprung's disease, which often initially presents with failure to pass meconium within 48 hours of birth and/or symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction (e.g., bilious vomiting and abdominal distention).

It consists of ultrasound or CT-guided percutaneous puncture of the cyst, aspiration of the cyst contents, injection of a scolicidal agent (e.g., hypertonic saline, ethanol), and reaspiration after at least 15 minutes. However, the PAIR procedure is not indicated for hydatid cysts that are smaller than 5 cm in diameter, as is the case here. Invasive procedures such as PAIR or surgical excision should be performed with the utmost care to prevent spillage of cyst contents, which could cause life-threatening anaphylactic shock and/or intraperitoneal seeding.","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous clindamycin","explanation":"\nClindamycin is not effective in the treatment of helminthic infections such as echinococcosis. It is, however, used to treat pyogenic liver abscess caused by anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides.

Laboratory studies show elevated titers of hepatitis B surface antigen in both the mother and the boy. Which of the following statements regarding the infant's condition is most accurate?","difficulty":4,"hint":"Elevated titers of HbsAg in both the mother and the infant suggest vertical transmission of the hepatitis B virus (HBV).","answers":[{"option":"Significant elevation of transaminases is not expected","explanation":"\nTransaminases are usually normal or only mildly elevated in cases of vertical transmission of HBV. Because HBV is not cytopathic itself and newborns lack mature cytotoxic T-cells that mediate damage to infected hepatocytes, the degree of hepatic tissue damage will be limited. Rarely, infected neonates may develop acute hepatitis B.\nNewborns of mothers with unknown HBV status should receive vaccine within 12 hours of birth. If the mother tests positive for HBsAg, hepatitis B immune globulin should be administered as soon as possible. Newborns of HBsAg negative mothers should be given the hepatitis B vaccine series before hospital discharge.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Breastfeeding should be avoided","explanation":"\nBreastfeeding should be recommended to all patients with maternal HBV, as HBV infection is not a contraindication to breastfeeding. Women with HBV infection should be counseled that breastfeeding does not increase the likelihood of infection in their children. However, breastfeeding should be delayed until passive‑active postexposure prophylaxis has been given. Since, in this patient, vertical transmission of HBV has already occurred, there is no reason to delay breastfeeding.","bool":false},{"option":"Lifetime risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is low","explanation":"The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is significant in neonatal hepatitis.

It produces an enterotoxin, which permanently activates a GS protein and thereby results in increased intracellular cAMP levels. This leads to secretion of chloride ions and water in the intestines, resulting in the typical rice-water diarrhea. V. cholerae is acid-labile, growing well in an alkaline medium (e.g. with a pH of 9). Accordingly, stomach acidity provides a natural barrier against V. cholera, so that a high amount of pathogens are required to cause infection (high infectious dose). A decrease in gastric acidity (e.g., due to treatment with proton pump inhibitors) reduces the infectious dose significantly.","bool":true},{"option":"Infection commonly precedes Guillain-Barré syndrome","explanation":"\nGuillain-Barré syndrome typically follows gastroenteritis due to Campylobacter jejuni.

Immediate removal of the ingested magnets is important because they can lead to serious complications (e.g., perforation, volvulus, infection, ileus), especially if the magnet is ingested with a metallic foreign body or if multiple magnets are ingested at different times. Therefore, flexible endoscopy is preferred because it allows any damage to the gastrointestinal wall to be visualized and assessed. If the magnets are further away from the stomach and the patient is asymptomatic, or if a single magnet is ingested, conservative management with serial abdominal x-rays to confirm passage through the intestines can be considered.

The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant; there is no guarding or rebound. There is tenderness to percussion along the left flank. Passive extension of her left hip worsens the pain. Her leukocyte count is 16,000/mm3 and urine pregnancy test is negative. Urinalysis shows 3+ glucose. An ultrasound of the abdomen shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This woman with poorly controlled diabetes presents with subacute flank pain, fever, and increased pain with extension of the hip, all of which suggest a certain diagnosis. Her polyuria is likely due to glucosuria from her poorly controlled diabetes.","answers":[{"option":"Psoas muscle abscess","explanation":"This patient's combination of subacute flank pain, positive psoas sign, fever, and leukocytosis suggests a psoas abscess. A psoas abscess can either be classified as a primary abscess, caused by hematogenous spread of infection (e.g., bacteremia, endocarditis), or a secondary abscess, which is due to local spread of infection (e.g., osteomyelitis, pyelonephritis, trauma). Primary abscesses are most common, and diabetes is an important risk factor for primary abscess formation.

The patient drinks two beers daily and has slightly increased levels of GGT, an indicator of chronic alcohol consumption. Some of this patient's features are consistent with acute pancreatitis (e.g., severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting). However, peritonitis that occurs as a result of acute pancreatitis causes paralytic ileus instead of mechanical bowel obstruction. Bowel sounds would be absent and abdominal ultrasonography would not demonstrate peristalsis in the case of paralytic ileus.","bool":false},{"option":"Ibuprofen","explanation":"Chronic therapy with NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, increases the risk of gastric ulcers and gastric wall perforation.

However, bloody diarrhea, which is a typical manifestation of acute mesenteric ischemia, is not present. Additionally, an ultrasound in acute mesenteric infarction would show a thickened bowel wall, decreased peristalsis in the ischemic segment, and absent or decreased blood flow in the corresponding mesenteric artery. Finally, in contrast to this patient's presentation, acute mesenteric ischemia progresses quickly over the course of hours.","bool":false},{"option":"Inflamed colonic diverticula","explanation":"Inflamed colonic diverticula, or diverticulitis, causes abdominal pain, as seen in this patient.

Although IBD may manifest with abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction, the patient is much older than the typical age of onset for IBD. He also does not have diarrhea, which is a typical feature of IBD.

Fistulization provides a conduit for the passage of gallstones into the small intestine, which may cause gallstone ileus. The stone typically advances over several days along the intestine, causing intermittent symptoms of obstruction (colicky abdominal pain, vomiting) before it lodges in the distal ileum at the ileocecal valve, which is the narrowest part of the small intestine. Pneumobilia is usually visualized on abdominal imaging due to air moving up toward the biliary ducts through the fistula.

Instead, she should remain on bowel rest until her postoperative paralytic ileus has resolved. Sips of clear fluids are permitted if tolerated.","bool":false},{"option":"Begin total parenteral nutrition","explanation":"\nTotal parenteral nutrition can be indicated in critically ill patients or patients who cannot tolerate oral intake for a prolonged period of time. While this patient with paralytic ileus should avoid oral intake until her bowel function has normalized, parenteral nutrition is not indicated at this time.","bool":false},{"option":"Gastrografin enema","explanation":"A gastrografin enema can be used to differentiate between partial and complete mechanical bowel obstruction or to evacuate stool from the rectum and colon in patients with large bowel obstruction. This patient has a functional bowel obstruction that affects the smooth muscle of both her small and large intestine. While a gastrografin enema may help to temporarily relieve constipation in her colon, it would not resolve the intestinal paralysis; therefore, gastrografin enema does not routinely play a role in the management of postoperative paralytic ileus.","bool":false},{"option":"Return to operating room for bowel resection","explanation":"Patients with complete mechanical bowel obstruction, persistent partial obstruction, and/or signs of bowel ischemia should be taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy to identify and remove the underlying cause of obstruction. Mechanical bowel obstruction may also present with abdominal distention, discomfort, and nausea, as seen in this patient; however, auscultation usually reveals increased high-pitched sounds and abdominal x-ray demonstrates distended loops of small or large bowel, air-fluid levels proximal to the obstruction, and collapse of the distal bowel.","bool":false},{"option":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","explanation":"Although not routinely performed in the workup of bowel obstruction, esophagogastroduodenoscopy could help to detect an underlying mechanical cause of the obstruction within the upper GI tract (e.g., a malignant tumor, stricture, or foreign body); however, abdominal x-ray and/or CT scan are generally preferred. Since this patient has a functional bowel obstruction, which results from temporary intestinal paralysis, upper endoscopy would not be indicated.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Colonoscopy","explanation":"\nColonoscopy may be considered in patients with large bowel obstruction to evacuate stool from the rectum and colon. However, this patient has a functional bowel obstruction that affects the smooth muscle of both her small and her large intestine. Colonoscopic bowel decompression does not resolve the intestinal paralysis and is not part of the management of postoperative paralytic ileus.","bool":false}]},{"id":477,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of generalized malaise, yellowish discoloration of the eyes, and pruritus on the back of his hands that worsens when exposed to sunlight for the past several months. He has not seen a physician in 15 years. Physical examination shows scleral icterus and mild jaundice. There is a pruritic rash with several small vesicles and hyperpigmented lesions on the dorsum of both hands. The causal pathogen of this patient's underlying condition was most likely acquired in which of the following ways?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient's scleral icterus and jaundice should raise suspicion for liver disease. His pruritic rash that worsens upon exposure to sunlight is suggestive of porphyria cutanea tarda, a condition that is associated with hepatitis C virus infection.","answers":[{"option":"Needlestick injury","explanation":"\nNeedlestick injury is a likely cause of this patient's hepatitis C infection as it is mainly transmitted parenterally. Therefore, certain populations such as health care workers and IV drug users are at increased risk of contracting the virus. Patients who received blood transfusions before 1992 are also at increased risk for hepatitis C, as donor blood was not screened for the virus before 1992. Other routes of transmission include vertical (from mother to fetus) and, rarely, sexual.","bool":true},{"option":"Bathing in freshwater","explanation":"Bathing in freshwater is a risk factor for schistosomiasis, a helminthic infection that can manifest with various different clinical manifestations depending on the exact species involved. Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis could also cause signs of liver damage but it is not associated with porphyria cutanea tarda, as seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhalation of spores","explanation":"The inhalation of spores is the mode of transmission for several different infections, including mucormycosis, Q fever, and pulmonary anthrax. Spore inhalation is not the mechanism of transmission for hepatitis C, which this patient has.","bool":false},{"option":"Sexual contact","explanation":"Sexual contact is the route of transmission for many infectious diseases, including syphilis, hepatitis B, and HIV. Hepatitis C may be transmitted sexually (especially in cases of HIV coinfection), however, this is very rare and another route of transmission is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Ingestion of raw shellfish","explanation":"Ingestion of raw shellfish is one of the major transmission modes for hepatitis A, which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Shellfish can concentrate the virus from seawater contaminated with human sewage, especially in regions with poor sanitation. Hepatitis C, which this patient most likely has, is not transmitted via food.","bool":false}]},{"id":478,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 52-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 4-day history of intermittent right-sided abdominal pain. The pain occurs 2–3 hours after meals and lasts 1-2 hours; it is not accompanied by fever or chills. One month ago, she underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention for an anterior-wall myocardial infarction. Since then, she has been following a rehabilitation regimen to work on her exercise capacity; she is currently able to climb one flight of stairs without shortness of breath. She has coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 88 kg (194 lb); BMI is 34 kg/m2. Abdominal examination shows no tenderness to palpation. Laboratory studies, including liver function tests, are within the reference ranges. ECG shows no signs of acute ischemia or interval changes compared to her last hospitalization. Abdominal ultrasound shows three small, intraluminal gallstones; gallbladder wall thickness is normal. There is no dilation of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic ducts. The patient inquires about the available treatment options for her current condition. In addition to a low-fat diet, which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Recurrent, intermittent, postprandial right upper quadrant pain suggests biliary colic due to cholelithiasis, which the abdominal ultrasonography confirms. This patient's recent myocardial infarction puts her at high risk for perioperative complications.","answers":[{"option":"Oral bile acid dissolution therapy","explanation":"In patients with uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis who are poor surgical candidates long-term (6–24 months) oral bile acid dissolution therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is indicated. In addition to a low-fat diet and UDCA therapy, patients should exercise regularly and avoid lithogenic drugs (e.g., estrogen, fibrates). Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice in patients with uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis who have no contraindications for surgery.","bool":true},{"option":"Rapid weight loss","explanation":"Although weight loss is recommended to help manage this patient's chronic medical conditions (i.e., obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus), it is associated with an increased risk of gallstone formation. Rapid weight loss should therefore be avoided in patients with cholelithiasis.","bool":false},{"option":"Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy","explanation":"\nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) can be used in the fragmentation of solitary cholesterol gallstones in patients who are poor surgical candidates. However, patients with multiple stones, such as this one, are not good candidates for ESWL. Moreover, ESWL is associated with high rates of biliary colic and gallstone recurrence, so this technique is not the first-line therapy in most cases.","bool":false},{"option":"Fenofibrate therapy","explanation":"\nFibrates may be indicated in patients with hyperlipidemia, which this patient has. However, fibrates inhibit cholesterol 7α hydroxylase, thereby decreasing bile acid synthesis, which leads to the supersaturation of bile with cholesterol and, potentially, to the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Therapy with fibrates should therefore be avoided in patients with cholelithiasis.","bool":false},{"option":"Emergency cholecystectomy","explanation":"Emergency cholecystectomy may be indicated in patients with cholelithiasis complicated by acute cholecystitis (i.e., patients with evidence of gallbladder gangrene/necrosis, perforation, and/or emphysematous cholecystitis). This patient presents with uncomplicated cholelithiasis, in which emergency cholecystectomy is not indicated. In most patients with uncomplicated cholelithiasis, elective rather than emergent cholecystectomy is indicated. This patient's recent myocardial infarction, however, makes her a poor surgical candidate, so a different approach is indicated.","bool":false}]},{"id":479,"info":"Gastrointestinal System","question":"A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-day history of episodic abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She takes aspirin, metoprolol, and metformin. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 91 kg (200 lb); her BMI is 34 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F). Physical examination shows dry mucous membranes, abdominal distension, and hyperactive bowel sounds. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows air in the biliary tract. This patient's symptoms are most likely caused by obstruction at which of the following locations?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient has risk factors for gallstone disease (e.g., obesity, age &gt; 40, female gender). In a patient with signs of intestinal obstruction (e.g., vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, hyperactive bowel sounds), the presence of pneumobilia is highly suggestive of gallstone ileus.","answers":[{"option":"Distal ileum","explanation":"\nGallstone ileus is a rare complication of cholecystitis in which a cholecystoenteric fistula forms, through which air can enter the biliary tree. Gallstones can also pass through into the bowel lumen, leading to bowel obstruction and gallstone ileus. The distal ileum is separated from the large intestine by the ileocecal valve, which is the narrowest part of the small intestine and hence the most likely location for gallstone obstruction. Other causes of distal ileal obstruction include fecaliths, Meckel diverticulum, and intussusception.","bool":true},{"option":"Proximal jejunum","explanation":"The jejunum is the section of bowel between the duodenum and the ileum. Jejunal obstruction would lead to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever, which are seen in this patient. However, jejunal obstruction is typically caused by bowel adhesions or intussusception, not gallstones. This patient's history does not include risk factors for adhesions (e.g., prior abdominal surgery), and she is outside of the typical age range for intussusception (children), making jejunal obstruction unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Pancreatic duct","explanation":"The pancreatic duct extends from the tail to the head of the pancreas and drains pancreatic fluid into the common bile duct. Pancreatic duct obstruction by a gallstone can cause acute pancreatitis with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever, which are symptoms seen in this patient. However, because pancreatic duct obstruction occurs upstream of the small bowel, symptoms of small bowel obstruction (e.g., hyperactive bowel sounds) would not be expected. In addition, pancreatitis would not cause pneumobilia.","bool":false},{"option":"Third part of the duodenum","explanation":"The third part of the duodenum lies posterior to the superior mesenteric artery. In duodenal obstruction due to superior mesenteric artery syndrome, narrowing of the aortomesenteric angle causes compression of the inferior portion of the duodenum, leading to nausea, vomiting, and symptoms of small bowel obstruction, which are seen in this patient. However, superior mesenteric artery syndrome would not explain this patient's pneumobilia.","bool":false},{"option":"Hepatic duct","explanation":"The hepatic duct joins the cystic duct to drain bile from the liver into the intestines. The common hepatic duct can be obstructed by an impacted gallstone in a condition known as Mirizzi syndrome, leading to the development of abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting. However, due to biliary obstruction, Mirizzi syndrome typically manifests with jaundice, which is not seen in this patient. Moreover, signs of intestinal obstruction (ileus) would not be expected.","bool":false}]}]
