Physical examination shows a new holosystolic murmur in the left midclavicular line that radiates to the axilla. There are linear reddish-brown lesions underneath the nail beds and tender violaceous nodules on the bilateral thenar eminences. Two sets of blood cultures grow Streptococcus mutans. A transthoracic echocardiogram shows moderate regurgitation of the mitral valve.

The 2-month history of intermittent illness, recurrent dental abscesses, and isolation of S. mutans on blood cultures make subacute infective endocarditis the most likely diagnosis.","answers":[{"option":"Fibrin clot formation","explanation":"\nFibrin clot formation is a key step in the pathogenesis of subacute infective endocarditis. First, endothelial damage occurs (in native valves this is typically due to turbulent blood flow), followed by adherence of platelets and fibrin to the damaged valve areas. These initially sterile platelet-fibrin aggregates can become infected by bacteria circulating in the blood, forming vegetations. This patient is at increased risk for streptococcal bacteremia due to recurrent dental abscesses. Microbial adherence to the platelet-fibrin nidus is mediated by interaction of bacterial cell wall components (e.g., dextrans) and the valvular endothelium. Fibrin clots encase this vegetation and subsequent destruction of the affected valves leads to valvular insufficiency, as seen here. This patient's physical examination findings of splinter hemorrhages and Osler nodes represent areas of microembolization of vegetation material.\nInfective endocarditis should always be considered in a patient with a fever of unknown origin.","bool":true},{"option":"Sterile platelet thrombi deposition","explanation":"\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) results from sterile (i.e., noninfectious) platelet thrombi deposition on the cardiac valves. NBTE most commonly affects the mitral valve; however, it typically manifests with signs and symptoms of systemic embolization rather than mitral valve dysfunction, which is seen here. This patient presents with fever and bacteremia, which is highly suggestive of infectious endocarditis. Moreover, NBTE usually affects patients with advanced malignancy or systemic lupus erythematosus, neither of which this patient has.","bool":false},{"option":"Leaflet calcification and fibrosis","explanation":"Leaflet calcification and fibrosis are pathologic changes seen in mitral stenosis (MS) due to rheumatic fever (RF). While MS does produce a murmur in the left midclavicular line, it is a diastolic murmur that follows an opening snap. Moreover, this patient has a TTE with evidence of mitral regurgitation, not stenosis. While acute RF can also manifest with joint pain, fever, and malaise, MS would not be expected until 10 to 20 years after the original illness, and blood cultures would be negative. Finally, this patient presents with subacute infective endocarditis, which individuals with MS are at an increased risk of developing, but calcification and fibrosis play no direct part in the pathogenesis of this condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Antibody cross-reaction","explanation":"\nAntibody cross-reaction due to molecular mimicry is the presumed pathogenic mechanism of rheumatic fever (RF). Acute RF may manifest with mitral regurgitation, joint pain, skin manifestations, and fever, all of which this patient has. However, RF also manifests with typical skin findings, such as erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules, which are not seen here. Moreover, this patient has no history of sore throat or group A streptococcal infection, which typically precede RF. Furthermore, blood cultures are negative in RF as it is an immunologic, non-infectious condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Myxomatous degeneration","explanation":"\nMyxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve is the underlying pathology of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). MVP is a risk factor for infective endocarditis, which this patient has, but it is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is most often an incidental finding on auscultation in asymptomatic patients. This patient presents with a new murmur on auscultation, making a pre-existing MVP unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Coagulative necrosis","explanation":"\nCoagulative necrosis is the mechanism that causes cell death in myocardial infarction (MI).

The ECG findings support this diagnosis.","answers":[{"option":"Increased serum K+","explanation":"\nDigoxin inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase, which leads to decreased K+ influx into the cells and if taken in excess, hyperkalemia. Inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase also decreases Na+ efflux from the cell, which decreases Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium levels results in increased cardiac inotropy and risk of cardiac arrhythmias. While hyperkalemia typically causes peaked T-waves, this patient's ECG findings of flattened T-waves and a prolonged PR interval are a direct manifestation of digoxin on the atrial and ventricular refractory periods and the AV node conduction velocity.

These findings suggest stasis dermatitis due to chronic venous disease.","answers":[{"option":"Dermal deposition of hemosiderin","explanation":"\nDermal deposition of hemosiderin is a key feature of stasis dermatitis. Elevated venous pressures from chronic venous disease result in red blood cell breakdown, which leads to hemosiderin production. Hemosiderin penetrates defective capillaries and accumulates in the dermis, which causes a pruritic, red-brown rash, as seen in this patient. The medial ankles are the most frequently involved site.","bool":true},{"option":"Contact of antigen with pre-sensitized T lymphocytes","explanation":"Contact of antigen with pre-sensitized T lymphocytes is the underlying mechanism of allergic contact dermatitis, which usually manifests with a pruritic, erythematous rash with indistinct margins. Products that contain fragrance are common contact allergens. However, this patient's rash preceded her use of a new lotion.

It decreases cardiac contractility (negative inotropic action) and heart rate (negative chronotropic action), slows AV node conduction (negative dromotropic action), and dilates the coronary arteries. The heart beats slower and less forcefully, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. The relative bradycardia leads to increased ventricular diastolic filling time and increased end-diastolic volume.

She has had a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss in the past 8 months despite normal appetite. She has no history of serious medical illness, and has not seen a physician in over 15 years. Physical examination shows a brown-black, asymmetrical macule on her left shoulder. Cardiac examination shows jugular venous distention and an S3 gallop best heard over the apex. Pitting edema is present in the bilateral lower extremities up to the mid-shin. A transthoracic echocardiogram shows a nonmobile mass protruding from the interatrial septum into the right atrium that partially occludes the tricuspid valve. A biopsy of the mass is most likely to show which of the following?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient has evidence of right-sided heart failure (JVD, S3 heart sound, pitting edema) due to a right atrial mass that is most likely causing obstruction of the tricuspid valve. Cardiac tumors are most commonly seen in the setting of metastatic disease.","answers":[{"option":"Nests of dysplastic melanocytes","explanation":"Nests of dysplastic melanocytes are seen in metastatic melanoma. Cardiac tumors can be classified as primary or secondary (metastatic). Metastatic tumors are approximately 20–30 times more common than primary cardiac tumors and more commonly occur on the right side of the heart. This patient's history of weight loss in combination with the asymmetrical mole raises suspicion of an occult melanoma that has metastasized to the heart. Melanoma is the most frequently implicated cancer, followed by lung and breast cancer.","bool":true},{"option":"Nonencapsulated groups of well-differentiated skeletal muscle cells","explanation":"Nonencapsulated groups of well-differentiated skeletal muscle cells are observed in biopsy samples of rhabdomyoma.

The majority of intracardiac rhabdomyomas arise in association with tuberous sclerosis, of which this patient has no clinical manifestations.","bool":false},{"option":"Clusters of bland cells without mitotic activity","explanation":"\nClusters of bland cells without mitotic activity suggest cardiac myxomas, the most common primary cardiac tumors. Histologic findings include mesenchymal cells within a mucoid, gelatinous stroma. Cardiac myxomas can cause systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss (due to production of interleukin 6), as seen here. However, the vast majority of these tumors occur as a mobile, pedunculated mass in the left atrium, rather than the right. Typically, cardiac myxomas manifest with symptoms of obstruction of blood flow through the heart (e.g., syncope, dyspnea, palpitations), a mid-diastolic murmur (similar to mitral stenosis), and/or a tumor plop on auscultation. Furthermore, primary cardiac neoplasms (e.g., cardiac myxoma) are not the most likely cause of cardiac tumors.","bool":false},{"option":"Sheets of large, atypical B cells with prominent nucleoli","explanation":"Sheets of large, atypical B cells with prominent nucleoli are consistent with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

This indicates elevated pulse pressure.","answers":[{"option":"Aortic regurgitation","explanation":"\nAortic regurgitation (AR) is often a complication of infectious endocarditis, which can manifest with the fever, chills, and dyspnea. Valvular bacterial vegetations can cause destruction and incompetency of the aortic valve. In AR, regurgitation of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle (LV) leads to higher end-diastolic volume and therefore higher preload and stroke volume, which increases aortic systolic pressure. Diastolic aortic pressure is classically decreased because of rapid return of blood to the LV through the incompetent aortic valve. Consequently, there would be an increase in pulse pressure, which can manifest with water hammer pulse and pulse-synchronous head nodding (de Musset sign).\n","bool":true},{"option":"Mitral regurgitation","explanation":"\nMitral regurgitation (MR) is often accompanied by a high-pitched, holosystolic murmur.

However, cardiac catheterization in this patient does not show an increase in left atrial pressure during systole.","bool":false},{"option":"Aortic stenosis","explanation":"\nAortic stenosis (AS) is often accompanied by a harsh systolic murmur with a crescendo-decrescendo pattern. Cardiac catheterization in AS typically shows a peak ventricular pressure that is significantly higher than the peak aortic pressure. This finding is a result of the elevated ventricular pressure required to pump blood through the stenotic aortic valve before the return to normal systolic pressure in the aorta. However, cardiac catheterization in this patient shows a peak ventricular pressure that is identical to the peak aortic pressure.","bool":false},{"option":"Mitral stenosis","explanation":"\nMitral stenosis (MS) is often accompanied by a rumbling, delayed diastolic murmur that is characterized by an opening snap. In contrast to the findings in this patient, cardiac catheterization would reveal a left atrial pressure that is significantly higher than the left ventricular pressure during the ventricular filling phase (i.e., diastole). This increase in pressure occurs as the left atrium contracts to fill the left ventricle across the stenotic mitral valve.","bool":false},{"option":"Pulmonary regurgitation","explanation":"On cardiac catheterization, pulmonary regurgitation is associated with increased end-diastolic right ventricular pressure due to the increased backflow of blood across the regurgitant pulmonary valve during diastole.

While generally rare, retroperitoneal hemorrhage is the most common cause of unexpected mortality after diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization. It often occurs when femoral access is obtained above the inguinal ligament, as compression of the puncture site is difficult in this area and sufficient hemostasis is not easily achieved. Patients usually become symptomatic after significant blood loss, which often leads to a late diagnosis of the condition. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage can also occur spontaneously or after only mild trauma in patients on oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin). \nIn hemodynamically unstable patients, the diagnosis is usually established clinically or with the help of ultrasound. Supportive treatment (e.g., monitoring, fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion, and normalization of coagulation factors if abnormal) is sufficient in most cases of retroperitoneal bleeding.

However, this patient appears hemodynamically stable and diagnosis should be confirmed before initiating invasive treatment.","bool":false},{"option":"Administer protamine sulfate","explanation":"Administration of protamine sulfate is indicated for heparin overdose or major active bleeding on heparin therapy in order to bind heparin and reverse its anticoagulation effects. This patient received a dose of unfractionated heparin prior to surgery and active bleeding is suspected. However, unfractionated heparin has a half-life of only 30–60 minutes, and thus the remaining effect is most likely minor 1.5 hours after administration.

The thickened myocardium in the right ventricle produces increased electrical activity, which shifts the axis of cardiac depolarization. TOF also involves an overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis. It is the most common congenital cyanotic heart lesion. In addition to these ECG findings, a chest x-ray showing a boot-shaped heart also supports the diagnosis. Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Pulmonary vascular congestion on x-ray of the chest","explanation":"Pulmonary vascular congestion seen on chest x-ray is a sign of left heart failure, with subsequent “backing up” of blood into the pulmonary vasculature, leading to enlarged pulmonary vessels. Although this finding is classically associated with congestive heart failure in adults (especially in older individuals), some congenital cardiac defects can also cause this finding (e.g., truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return). In TOF (the most likely diagnosis in this case), there is a right ventricular outflow obstruction, leading to decreased blood flow to the pulmonary vasculature. Chest x-ray would more likely show decreased pulmonary vascular markings and a classic boot-shaped heart.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased blood pressure in both lower extremities","explanation":"Decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities is characteristic of aortic coarctation, which manifests with differential cyanosis (e.g., of the lower extremities) rather than central cyanosis (e.g., blue lips and fingers) as seen in this patient. Moreover, aortic coarctation rarely causes hypoxemia; in the rare case of hypoxemia, it is usually mild. Finally, aortic coarctation causes chronic rather than episodic symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Anomalous pulmonary venous return on MR angiography","explanation":"Anomalous pulmonary venous return on MR angiography would be diagnostic of total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR). Although TAPVR is survivable and can cause central cyanosis in patients with a right-to-left shunt, symptoms are continuous rather than episodic, as seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Diminutive left ventricle on echocardiogram","explanation":"A diminutive left ventricle on echocardiogram is seen in hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which can also manifest with central cyanosis. However, the cyanosis would not be episodic (as in this patient) because the hypoplastic left heart would never be able to adequately perfuse the peripheral tissues.","bool":false},{"option":"Machine-like hum on auscultation","explanation":"A machine-like murmur over the heart is pathognomonic for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA is usually an acyanotic congenital condition because most blood passes through normal circulation and thus sufficient oxygen saturation is maintained; only a small amount of blood is pumped through the PDA. Symptoms can vary depending on the degree of patency but may include tachycardia, tachypnea, and poor growth. The infant described here is lagging behind in terms of weight gain, but vital signs are within the normal range for a 5-month old infant (HR 80–160/min, RR 30–60/min).

Small VSDs may cause a loud systolic murmur with palpable thrill due to the large pressure differential between the left and right ventricles, while large VSDs are typically less obvious on auscultation. If left untreated, VSDs can lead to pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.","bool":true},{"option":"Wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound","explanation":"A wide, fixed (i.e., does not change with respiration) splitting of the second heart sound is characteristic of atrial septal defect (ASD).

Fixed splitting of the second heart sound is not a common feature of VSD.","bool":false},{"option":"Diastolic murmur preceded by opening snap","explanation":"A diastolic murmur preceded by an opening snap at the apex is characteristic of mitral stenosis (MS). The opening snap occurs when leaflet motion suddenly stops during diastole after the stenosed valve has opened fully. While a short, mid-diastolic murmur can sometimes be heard in VSD due to increased blood flow across the mitral valve, an opening snap would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis","explanation":"A systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis (Valsalva maneuver) is characteristic of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The Valsalva maneuver reduces both preload and left ventricular afterload, which would exacerbate the subaortic stenosis in HOCM but reduce the left-to-right shunt of blood in VSD. The Valsalva maneuver would therefore decrease this patient's murmur intensity.","bool":false},{"option":"Continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound","explanation":"A continuous murmur that becomes louder at the second heart sound is characteristic of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The murmur is best appreciated in the left infraclavicular region and results from the constant flow of blood from the high pressure aorta to the low pressure pulmonary artery.

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are commonly used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.","answers":[{"option":"Gingival hyperplasia","explanation":"\nGingival hyperplasia is a side effect of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil. In patients with atrial fibrillation, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers act as rate control agents through two distinct mechanisms. First, these agents slow down conduction of atrial electrical impulses through the AV node. Second, inhibition of calcium entry into ventricular myocytes reduces the ventricular rate.

Other side effects include dose-dependent bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension.","bool":true},{"option":"Peripheral edema","explanation":"\nPeripheral edema is a side effect of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP CCBs) such as nifedipine. DHP CCBs act mainly on vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilation; this mechanism makes them most useful for treating hypertension.

Pulmonary artery catheterization showing increased PCWP helps to identify the most likely type of shock.","answers":[{"option":"Acute myocardial infarction","explanation":"\nAcute myocardial infarction is the most likely diagnosis in this older patient who presents with features of cardiogenic shock. Myocardial infarction causes an acute reduction in cardiac function that usually affects the left ventricle (95% of patients). Loss of left ventricular function leads to an increase in left atrial pressure, which is measured as an increase in PCWP. Progressive loss of cardiac function further impedes venous return to the heart, leading to a high CVP. In addition, there is a decrease in cardiac output and cardiac index, which is countered by systemic vasoconstriction in an attempt to maintain central perfusion. This vasoconstriction leads to an increased SVR and cool extremities with delayed capillary refill.\nSee “Hemodynamic parameters in shock” table.","bool":true},{"option":"Massive pulmonary embolism","explanation":"\nMassive pulmonary embolism (PE) can manifest with obstructive shock, in which blood flow from the right heart to the left heart is blocked. This blockage results in blood “backing up” into the right atrium, resulting in increased CVP. Low cardiac output results in hypotension, which induces peripheral vascular constriction and thus increases SVR.

The increased height reflects the fact that the left ventricle must reach a higher pressure to overcome the aortic pressure (so that the aortic valve opens), and, consequently, an end-systolic pressure that is higher than normal.

Over time, this effect can lead to RV myocardial dysfunction (cor pulmonale). The increased afterload prevents adequate pumping of blood from the RV and delays the closure of the pulmonary valve, resulting in a wide or fixed split S2. Furthermore, the increased diastolic pressure within the pulmonary artery leads to increased velocity of pulmonary valve closure, resulting in a loud P2.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased right ventricular preload","explanation":"Although eventually possible, increased RV preload is not typically caused by pulmonary hypertension since diastolic filling occurs after pulmonary valve closure.

However, this patient's progressive onset, age, and lack of murmur do not suggest a heart defect, making this answer unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased left ventricular afterload","explanation":"\nPulmonary hypertension does not change left ventricular (LV) afterload because this condition does not increase the work required by the LV to pump blood during systole. Systemic hypertension increases LV afterload, which can cause exertional chest pain, fatigue, breathlessness, and a loud S2 (due to loud A2). However, hypertension and increased LV afterload would lead to a loud heart sound in the aortic area (2nd right intercostal space). LV outflow obstructions including aortic stenosis and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy can also present with signs of LV afterload.

Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state; the risk of venous thromboembolisms reaches its peak in the first 6 weeks postpartum, when hypercoagulability is accompanied by endothelial injury (e.g., due to surgical delivery) and possibly venous stasis (e.g., due to immobilization after delivery). Smoking also increases the risk of DVT, as does delivery via cesarean section, maternal age &gt; 35 years, and preterm delivery. LMWH, administered subcutaneously, is the initial treatment of choice because of its immediate antithrombotic effect and safety during breastfeeding. If no significant bleeding has occurred, it can safely be started 12 hours after cesarean section.","bool":true},{"option":"Warfarin","explanation":"\nWarfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) is commonly prescribed for oral anticoagulation in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT); however, it is not indicated as initial monotherapy in patients with acute DVT. Warfarin monotherapy induces a transient hypercoagulable state in the first few days of therapy as it decreases anticoagulant proteins C and S because of their shorter half-life (6–10h) before reducing the coagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X (half-life of 2–4 days). To not worsen the patient's DVT and/or cause warfarin-induced skin necrosis, the initial therapy must contain another drug that has an immediate antithrombotic effect, before introducing an oral anticoagulation (bridging therapy).","bool":false},{"option":"Reassurance","explanation":"This patient's postpartum state, history of cesarean section, symptoms (fever, leg pain) and examination findings (erythema, edema, warmth, and a positive Homan sign in the affected leg) all indicate a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality and requires immediate intervention.","bool":false},{"option":"Graduated compression stockings","explanation":"\nGraduated compression stockings are indicated in the management of lymphedema since the compression of these tight-fitting stockings improve lymphatic drainage and decrease edema. This patient's physical examination findings (e.g., fever, leg swelling, erythema, warmth) shortly after surgical delivery suggest postpartum deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rather than lymphedema. In this case, graduated compression stockings can be used to decrease pain and edema of acute DVT, but they would not prevent clot lysis or propagation.","bool":false},{"option":"Fasciotomy","explanation":"Surgical fasciotomy is the treatment of choice to relieve the pressure, and thus, restore perfusion in patients with compartment syndrome. Acute compartment syndrome is a possible cause of postpartum limb pain, as it can be triggered by intrapartum hypotension (e.g., due to blood loss) or after the application of vasoconstrictive therapeutic agents (e.g., oxytocin to induce labor). In the early stages, it can manifest with swelling, paresthesia, and pain that is exacerbated by passive stretching or extension of the muscles; distal pulses are often initially palpable and do not rule out the diagnosis. However, physical examination typically shows very tight, “wood-like” muscles. This patient's examination findings suggest deep venous thrombosis rather than compartment syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Dicloxacillin","explanation":"\nDicloxacillin is indicated in mild cases of cellulitis, which can manifest with leg pain, erythematous skin, pasty swelling, and fever. A positive Homan sign, however, is not typical of this condition. Furthermore, the lack of a possible portal of entry (e.g., minor skin injury) makes this diagnosis less likely. Though cellulitis of the breast is a possible complication of breastfeeding that most commonly occurs within the first 4 weeks after delivery, cellulitis of a limb is not a typical complication of the postpartum period.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Embolectomy","explanation":"Embolectomy is not indicated in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), but may be considered for patients with acute limb ischemia (ALI) within the first 6–24 hours to restore arterial blood supply in a viable, nonthreatened limb. Although ALI can manifest with acute pain, it is unlikely to cause significant swelling, redness, and a positive Homan sign. Instead, patients with ALI typically have a source of arterial embolus (e.g., atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction) and present with a cool limb, decreased peripheral pulses, and possibly sensory symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Urokinase","explanation":"\nUrokinase is a thrombolytic agent that is indicated in the treatment of pulmonary embolism, phlegmasia cerulea dolens, massive ileofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hemodynamic instability, and in patients who have failed anticoagulation. Although this patient has a DVT, it is located in the popliteal vein rather than the proximal ileofemoral vein, which indicates that another step is more appropriate.

Administration of higher dosages of this drug is most likely to result in which of the following?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Administration of metoprolol would help to counteract this adverse effect.","answers":[{"option":"Reflex sympathetic activity","explanation":"Low-dose nitrate improves myocardial perfusion primarily by acting as a venodilator that decreases ventricular wall tension via preload reduction. In addition, high-dose nitrate dilates coronary and peripheral arteries, thereby preventing coronary spasms and reducing ventricular afterload along with subsequent myocardial oxygen demand. However, peripheral arterial dilation also causes systemic hypotension, which induces a reflex sympathetic activity leading to tachycardia and increased myocardial contractility. As a result, myocardial oxygen demand paradoxically increases. Simultaneous administration of β-blockers has a synergetic anti-ischemic effect and can help prevent reflex tachycardia.","bool":true},{"option":"Development of tolerance","explanation":"\nNitrate tolerance often develops after 2–3 days of continuous administration and is more likely with high dosages and long-acting preparations.

Furthermore, PAD does not manifest with thrombocytopenia.","bool":false},{"option":"Fat embolization","explanation":"Fat embolization is a serious complication of long bone fractures (e.g., humerus or femur) and can result in thrombocytopenia. However, fat embolism most commonly manifests with acute-onset respiratory symptoms (e.g., hypoxemia, dyspnea, tachypnea) due to obstruction of the pulmonary circulation, features of neurological involvement (e.g., confusion, lethargy, seizures), and a petechial rash on the axilla and chest wall due to capillary occlusion.

The ABG shows compensated primary respiratory alkalosis, likely due to hyperventilation.","answers":[{"option":"Impaired myocardial relaxation","explanation":"\nChronic uncontrolled hypertension is the most common cause of HFpEF. Chronic hypertension increases the afterload against which the left ventricle (LV) contracts. As a compensatory mechanism, the myocardium undergoes concentric hypertrophy to maintain cardiac output.

As a result, patients develop an increase in left ventricular filling pressures and reduced ventricular filling with normal ventricular contraction (i.e., diastolic heart failure).

Loop diuretics are a first-line treatment for symptomatic relief in acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure in patients with normal or elevated blood pressure. To assess the response to therapy and prevent excessive diuresis and preload reduction, it is important to monitor for adverse effects such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia as well as weight changes and volume status. Intravenous vasodilators (e.g., nitroglycerine, nitroprusside) can be considered as an adjunct treatment. These agents cause peripheral vasodilation, resulting in pooling of blood in the venous system, which rapidly reduces ventricular filling pressures and improves cardiac function.","bool":true},{"option":"Intravenous morphine therapy","explanation":"\nOpiates such as morphine can reduce patient anxiety and the work of breathing by decreasing central sympathetic output. They also cause peripheral vasodilation and venodilation, decreasing ventricular filling pressure.

These findings are caused by an accessory atrioventricular pathway (i.e., bundle of Kent) that bypasses the AV node. Atrial fibrillation occurs in about 20% of patients with WPW syndrome and should be treated with rhythm control agents (e.g., procainamide). AV nodal blocking agents (e.g., adenosine, beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil) are contraindicated since they increase conduction of atrial impulses through the accessory pathway. This pathway has a short refractory period, allowing frequent conduction to the ventricles and induction of fatal arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation), which has occurred here.","bool":true},{"option":"Epsilon wave following the QRS complex","explanation":"An epsilon wave following the QRS complex is highly specific for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which may cause dizziness, palpitations, chest pain and sudden cardiac death.

Blood preferentially flows via the path of least resistance. When there is a high degree of RV outflow obstruction, blood will flow through the VSD instead of through the pulmonary artery for oxygenation in the lungs. As a result, deoxygenated blood will enter the left ventricle via the VSD and be pumped into the aorta and systemic circulation. If there is minimal RV outflow obstruction, blood will flow through the pulmonary vasculature, and become oxygenated before reaching the left ventricle, resulting in a reduction of cyanosis. In TOF, the single S2 can result from an attenuated pulmonary component (P2) that is often not heard on auscultation.\nOlder children with TOF tend to squat during spells of hypoxia, which relieves symptoms by increasing systemic vascular resistance and, in turn, left ventricular outflow resistance. This creates higher left ventricular pressures, so that blood in the right ventricle will be directed through the pulmonary vasculature rather than the VSD. The increased blood flow across the RV outflow obstruction during squatting is also associated with an increased intensity of the ejection murmur.","bool":true},{"option":"Size of ventricular septal defect","explanation":"A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the four features of TOF but it is not the main determinant of cyanosis. Rather, it is the pressure differences across the VSD that determine the degree of cyanosis.

RVH is a compensatory mechanism against the outflow tract obstruction, which helps to reduce cyanosis by increasing flow through the stenotic pulmonary vasculature so that deoxygenated blood does not flow through the VSD and into the systemic circulation. However, RVH can only compensate to a small degree to improve normal circulatory flow and is, therefore, only a minor determinant of cyanosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Degree of left ventricular outflow obstruction","explanation":"\nLeft ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis) is not one of the four features of TOF. However, if aortic stenosis (or any form of increased left ventricular outflow resistance) was present, this would decrease right-to-left shunting by creating higher left-sided pressures and thus reduce, rather than increase, cyanosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Size of atrial septal defect","explanation":"\nAtrial septal defect (ASD) is not one of the four features of TOF. However, in a patient with TOF, the presence of a concomitant ASD could lead to greater right-to-left shunting and thus exacerbate cyanosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Degree of aortic override","explanation":"Although an overriding aorta is one of the four features of TOF, it is not the main determinant of cyanosis. In patients with TOF, the aorta is displaced to the right ventricle, over the VSD, allowing blood from both ventricles to be pumped into the aorta. This causes deoxygenated blood to enter the systemic circulation, contributing to cyanosis.

Anginal pain relief is mainly achieved by venous dilation (venous pooling), which leads to decreased end-diastolic pressure (i.e., decreased preload), reduced myocardial wall tension, and improved myocardial perfusion. The decreased preload results in reduced heart size and decreased myocardial oxygen demand. To a lesser degree, nitrates decrease afterload by triggering arterial vasodilation, thus reducing myocardial contraction effort and oxygen demand. Because the coronary arteries are already fully dilated in patients with CAD in an attempt to provide as much oxygen to cardiac tissue as possible, the effect of nitrates on these vessels is limited.\nLife-threatening hypotension may occur if nitrates are taken within 24 hours of a PDE-5 inhibitor such as sildenafil.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased venous pooling","explanation":"Decreased venous pooling can result from the use of compression stockings or sympathomimetic drugs that cause vasoconstriction of arteriolar and venous vasculature.

It primarily acts by blocking the Na+/K+ ATPase channel, resulting in decreased Na+/Ca2+  antiporter activity and increased inotropy. Digoxin also increases vagus nerve activity, which has a negative chronotropic effect and leads to PR prolongation with possible atrioventricular block. Pharmacodynamically, hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity by enhancing its affinity for Na+/K+ ATPase. For this reason, predisposing factors for hypokalemia, such as loop diuretics and thiazide diuretics, should generally be avoided.\nAlthough it can increase serum potassium, spironolactone also predisposes the patient to digoxin toxicity because it decreases renal clearance of digoxin.","bool":true},{"option":"Prolonged QT interval","explanation":"\nProlonged QT intervals are associated with electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), congenital syndromes, structural heart abnormalities, and drug effects (e.g., antiarrhythmic agents, antidepressants, phenothiazines, 1st-generation antihistamines).

Acute mitral valve regurgitation would result in a new systolic murmur that would be heard best over the apex, not the left sternal border. Patients with severe acute mitral regurgitation would also have findings consistent with left heart failure (pulmonary edema, cool extremities, and altered mental status), none of which this patient has. Rupture of a papillary muscle is most often a complication in patients with involvement of the posterior descending artery, which is usually supplied by the right coronary artery, whereas this patient had an occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.","bool":false},{"option":"Ascending aortic dissection rupture","explanation":"\nAscending aortic dissection rupture can cause hemorrhage into the pericardium or the mediastinum, which would manifest with acute onset chest pain and evidence of cardiogenic shock. While anterior aortic dissection can also result in a murmur due to associated aortic regurgitation, the murmur would be diastolic rather than systolic. Aortic dissection would also not explain the presence of jugular venous distention or pedal edema. Moreover, although aortic dissection can lead to myocardial infarction (due to extension of the dissection to the coronary arteries), aortic dissection is not a described complication of myocardial infarction.","bool":false},{"option":"Left ventricular aneurysm rupture","explanation":"\nLeft ventricular aneurysms develop weeks to months following myocardial infarction.

The SMA supplies the derivatives of the embryological midgut, including the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), ascending colon (right colic artery), and first two-thirds of the transverse colon (middle colic artery). The cecum and appendix are supplied by the ileocolic artery.","bool":true},{"option":"Inferior mesenteric artery","explanation":"The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) branches off from the abdominal aorta at the level of L3. This artery supplies the last third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the upper rectum (superior rectal artery), all structures that arise from the embryological hindgut.

Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient might have presented with substernal chest pain radiating to her jaw.","answers":[{"option":"Confusion due to decreased stroke volume","explanation":"Confusion due to decreased stroke volume is consistent with cardiogenic shock, which is the most likely cause of shock in this patient. Poor left ventricular output results in elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). In addition, hypotension activates the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Peripheral vasoconstriction also causes cold, clammy extremities.","bool":true},{"option":"Mottled skin due to release of endotoxins","explanation":"Release of endotoxins is consistent with septic shock. Septic shock results from systemic vasodilation and capillary leakage. Initially, the skin is typically warm and flushed, but as shock progresses, the skin becomes mottled, cool and pale. However, septic shock typically results in decreased SVR (due to peripheral vasodilation) and decreased PCWP (due to decreased left ventricular preload caused pooling of blood in peripheral circulation).","bool":false},{"option":"Cold skin due to loss of intravascular fluid volume","explanation":"Loss of intravascular fluid volume is consistent with hypovolemic shock. In hypovolemic shock, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, which causes vasoconstriction and thus an increased SVR. Although SVR is increased in this patient, her PCWP is inconsistent with hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock would result in a decreased PCWP due to preload reduction from intravascular depletion.","bool":false},{"option":"Bradycardia due to neurologic dysfunction","explanation":"\nBradycardia due to neurologic dysfunction is consistent with increased intracranial pressure (Cushing reflex) and spinal cord damage above T6 level. Spinal cord damage can cause hypotension and feeble peripheral pulses (neurogenic shock).

Carvedilol is a nonselective beta blocker with additional α-blocking action.","answers":[{"option":"Hypotension","explanation":"As beta blockers are class II antiarrhythmic drugs, carvedilol can be administered to lower heart rate by reducing AV conduction velocity. However, because of its α-blocking action, carvedilol also inhibits α1-adrenergic receptors of blood vessels, which leads to relaxation of smooth muscle and thus vasodilation. This decreases peripheral vascular resistance, which in turn reduces preload and afterload and might cause orthostatic hypotension. This adverse effect is not observed in propranolol, which does not have an α-blocking effect, but only blocks β1, β2, and β3 receptors.","bool":true},{"option":"Bronchospasm","explanation":"Non-selective beta blockers inhibit ß1, ß2, and ß3 receptors.

It is caused by two different mechanisms: First, β-adrenergic blockade impairs urinary potassium excretion by inhibiting the secretion of renin, which in turn decreases aldosterone synthesis. Second, beta blockers directly decrease cellular uptake of potassium by inhibiting Na+/K+-ATPase. As both carvedilol and propranolol are non-selective beta blockers, hyperkalemia is a possible side effect of both.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperglycemia","explanation":"Blockade of ß2 receptors in pancreatic cells impairs insulin release, which lowers cellular glucose uptake. Through this mechanism, non-selective beta blockers can cause hyperglycemia with impaired glucose tolerance or even new-onset diabetes. As both carvedilol and propranolol are non-selective beta blockers, hyperglycemia is a possible side effect of both.","bool":false},{"option":"Bradycardia","explanation":"Inhibition of ß1 receptors on cardiac muscle tissue decreases heart rate and can lead to bradycardia.

LVH leads to increased left ventricular oxygen demand, resulting in myocardial ischemia (angina) during periods of strenuous exercise or stress.

Furthermore, this patient's presentation is consistent with AS, which suggests that a different mechanism is responsible for his symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Inflammatory constriction of the bronchioles","explanation":"Inflammation and constriction of the bronchioles is the underlying mechanism of virus-induced bronchospasm. Common respiratory viruses (as this patient likely had) can cause epithelial damage to the airways, induce inflammation and bronchospasm, and subsequently trigger wheezing in both patients with and without underlying asthma. While his recent cold and exertional dyspnea could be consistent with bronchospasm, his presyncopal symptoms and heart murmur suggest that a different mechanism may be responsible for this patient's symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Cellular injury of the esophageal epithelium","explanation":"Injury to the esophageal epithelium is the underlying mechanism of GERD, and is secondary to acid exposure from reflux of gastric contents. GERD should always be considered in the differential for chest pain, as it may commonly present with atypical chest pain. However, this patient presents with typical chest pain (e.g., retrosternal, exertional, resolves with rest) consistent with angina, and his presyncopal symptoms and heart murmur suggest a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased release of endogenous insulin","explanation":"\nGlyburide, a sulfonylurea used for the treatment of diabetes, increases endogenous insulin secretion by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells.

The higher dosage of aspirin is maintained until symptoms resolve (usually 3–4 weeks), then tapered to the standard prophylaxis dosage. Rare complications of Dressler syndrome include pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis.\nDressler syndrome is an autoimmune response to cardiac muscle cells that occurs &gt; 1 week after MI.

Let's have a look at the location of the murmur: it is best heard at the left sternal border near Erb point (cardiology). This location makes MS unlikely (usually best heard at the apex) but is consistent with a murmur caused by AR due to valvular disease. Now, here comes the tricky part. In this patient, TS and PR cannot be excluded by cardiac auscultation because the left sternal border is also the location at which murmurs due to TS and PR are best heard. However, subtle details make AR more likely. PR can occur in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease (cor pulmonale) or chronic congestive heart failure, but this patient has no clinical features to suggest either of these etiologies. Isolated TS or PR are extremely rare (usually caused by endocarditis in intravenous drug users, or by congenital heart defects), and manifest with features of right heart failure, which are not seen here. This patient's history of emigration from Nepal increases the likelihood that the underlying etiology of valvular heart disease is rheumatic heart disease, which most commonly affects the mitral and aortic valves. In patients with AR, a widened pulse pressure (due to increased end-diastolic volume and a subsequent increase in stroke volume) is a common finding.\nOther common causes of AR include a congenital bicuspid aortic valve (most common cause of AR in high-income countries) and aortic root dilation due to connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). In contrast to AR due to valvular disease, the murmur of AR secondary to aortic root diseases is heard best over the right upper sternal border.\nTiming the murmur against the carotid pulse is an important skill to master; if you are finding it difficult to time the murmur, try listening to the murmur again between 10 and 20 seconds using a slow playback speed and gradually increase the playback speed until you are proficient in timing the murmur.","bool":true},{"option":"Aortic valve stenosis","explanation":"The characteristic triad of symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) is exertional dyspnea, stable angina, and exertional dizziness/syncope caused by left ventricular outflow obstruction.

However, the pain of myocardial infarction is typically described as retrosternal chest discomfort, tightness, or pressure rather than the pleuritic chest pain this patient is experiencing. Furthermore, stent thrombosis would not account for this patient's pericardial friction rub or the pericardial or pleural effusions.","bool":false},{"option":"Pericardial infiltration with neutrophils","explanation":"Infiltration of the pericardium with neutrophils can occur as a complication of myocardial infarction, in which case neutrophils and fibrin are found in the pericardium, adjacent to the necrotic myocardium (early infarct-associated pericarditis). Although this patient is at risk for post-MI complications, early infarct-associated pericarditis is usually seen within the first week after a myocardial infarction. This patient is 3 weeks post-MI and therefore beyond the window for early infarct-associated pericarditis.","bool":false},{"option":"Embolism to left pulmonary artery","explanation":"Embolism to the pulmonary artery is the mechanism of pulmonary embolism. Many of this patient's symptoms are similar to those of PE, including pleuritic chest pain, cough, and low-grade fever. This patient's left-sided pleural effusion could be explained by PE. However, chest pain that improves with leaning forward indicates a different process, and a pericardial friction rub and pericardial effusion are not features of PE.","bool":false},{"option":"Outpouching of ventricular wall","explanation":"In true ventricular aneurysms, a portion of the ventricular free wall affected by the MI will outpouch, putting patients at risk for cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, and thrombus formation. Ventricular aneurysm occurs between 2 weeks and several months after MI, which fits the timeframe of this patient. On chest x-ray, aneurysms may cause enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. However, ventricular aneurysm would not cause the pericardial friction rub or pleuritic chest pain seen here. Furthermore, the vast majority of ventricular aneurysm form on the anterior or apical walls, due to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery; this patient's occlusion was in the right coronary artery.","bool":false},{"option":"Rupture of interventricular septum","explanation":"A myocardial infarct affecting the interventricular septum can result in its rupture, creating a ventricular septal defect. This causes a left-to-right shunt, resulting in chest pain, new-onset systolic murmur, and heart failure if the defect is sufficiently large. While septal rupture can happen as late as 2 weeks post-MI, it usually happens at 3–5 days. This patient's symptoms began 3 weeks post-MI, which places him beyond the window for rupture. Furthermore, his cardiac examination revealed a pericardial friction rub, not the systolic ejection murmur that would be expected in interventricular rupture. In addition, an interventricular septal rupture would not explain this patient's pericardial effusion.","bool":false}]},{"id":153,"info":"Cardiovascular System","question":"A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of 2 episodes of loss of consciousness over the past week.

She has been unable to carry out her daily activities. She also reports some chest tightness that resolves with rest. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She immigrated with her family from India 10 years ago. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 115/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows accentuation and splitting of S2.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of these findings?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient has features of mitral stenosis (opening snap and diastolic murmur along with atrial fibrillation) that has progressed and caused further hemodynamic changes. Mitral stenosis commonly occurs as a late complication of rheumatic fever, which is more common in developing countries where patients may not have been adequately treated.","answers":[{"option":"Increased left atrial pressure","explanation":"\nMitral stenosis leads to increased left atrial pressure, causing both left atrial dilatation, which may result in atrial fibrillation, and an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure to overcome the increased left heart pressure (pulmonary hypertension). Over time, this will lead to pulmonary vascular remodeling, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, splitting of S2, and right ventricular hypertrophy (as indicated by the right axis deviation) to compensate. Right ventricular failure eventually manifests with characteristic features such as jugular venous distention and pitting edema.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased preload","explanation":"\nPreload to the right ventricle is determined by central venous pressure and venous return to the heart and may be increased in states that expand blood volume (such as congestive heart failure). While this patient shows signs of right-sided heart failure, the presence of mitral stenosis with right axis deviation suggests a different underlying mechanism of the patient's disease.","bool":false},{"option":"Left-to-right shunting","explanation":"\nLeft-to-right shunting may be present in patients with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or an atrial septal defect (ASD).

She does not have a murmur that suggests a VSD or ASD (holosystolic murmur).","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased left ventricular contractility","explanation":"Decreased left ventricular contractility may be due to ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. A decrease in contractility may lead to left heart failure, increased left heart pressures, and subsequent right heart failure.

MS causes a decrease in LVEDP due to impaired ability to fill the left ventricle in diastole through the stenotic valve.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased systemic arterial resistance","explanation":"Increased systemic arterial resistance can be seen in patients with essential hypertension or secondary causes of hypertension. This may eventually lead to left ventricular hypertrophy that can evolve into diastolic heart failure.

The increased afterload created by the stenotic aortic valve reduces cardiac output, which results in angina, syncope, and ultimately, heart failure. Other common underlying risk factors for AS, especially in younger patients, include bicuspid aortic valves and a history of rheumatic fever.\nTo confirm this patient's diagnosis and evaluate the extent of AS, the next best diagnostic step would be to perform transthoracic echocardiography.","bool":true},{"option":"Rupture of the chordae tendineae","explanation":"Rupture of the chordae tendineae can lead to mitral regurgitation (MR), which also manifests with a systolic murmur. However, the murmur in MR is typically heard best at the apex and radiates to the axilla and not the carotids. Also, rupture of the chordae tendineae results in acute MR, most likely leading to severe symptoms such as pulmonary edema or even cardiogenic shock.","bool":false},{"option":"Embolus in the pulmonary artery","explanation":"Although this patient's syncope may be due to pulmonary embolism (PE), PE severe enough to cause syncope would not resolve on its own nor be asymptomatic after the event.

Typical features of this disease include nocturnal snoring, morning headaches, poor concentration, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and depression. Nocturnal apneic episodes in individuals with OSA result in nocturnal hypercapnia, which, in turn, causes an increased sympathetic response that leads to secondary hypertension. Obesity, especially around the neck, is the most important risk factor for developing OSA, and weight loss will often improve symptoms.","bool":true},{"option":"Hypophyseal neoplasm","explanation":"Hypophyseal or pituitary adenomas can cause a mass effect leading to headaches. Secondary hypercortisolism due to increased ACTH secretion from a functional pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease) could also explain this patient's hypertension, poor concentration, and obesity. However, pituitary adenomas usually cause visual field defects (e.g., bitemporal hemianopsia), which are not reported on neurological examination.

Because left ventricular hypertrophy commonly results in diastolic dysfunction, individuals with AS rely on the contraction of the left atrium for ventricular filling. The increase in diastolic filling pressure can, in turn, cause left atrial dilatation, which increases the risk of AF. AF decreases left ventricular preload as a result of uncoordinated atrial contraction (which impairs diastolic filling of the left ventricle) and tachycardia (which shortens the duration of diastole and reduces ventricular filling time). If AF develops in individuals with severe AS, it can exacerbate symptoms of angina and dyspnea due to pulmonary edema, which is likely responsible for this patient's worsening shortness of breath.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased impulse conduction across the AV node","explanation":"Decreased impulse conduction across the AV node occurs in patients with nodal conduction abnormalities, which can cause angina, dizziness, and/or an irregular pulse, depending on the degree of AV block.

The click may be followed by a mid-to-late systolic murmur indicating mitral regurgitation. Since the prolapse occurs when the contracting ventricle reaches a critical volume, the timing of the click varies according to the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV). Decreased EDV, e.g., due to decreased venous return to the heart during abrupt standing (i.e., decreased preload) causes the leaflets to prolapse sooner, resulting in an earlier onset (i.e., closer to S1) and increased intensity of auscultatory findings. Conversely, maneuvers that increase the volume (e.g., squatting) result in a later onset and decreased intensity.","bool":true},{"option":"Leaning forward","explanation":"Leaning forward brings the heart closer to the chest, but it has no significant impact on preload or afterload, so it does not affect the timing of the murmur of mitral valve prolapse.

In AR, blood flows back from the aorta into the left ventricle (LV) during diastole, decreasing aortic diastolic pressure (N = 60–90 mm Hg). The regurgitant blood mixes with blood flowing from the left atrium to fill the LV, increasing the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV). This increase in LVEDV leads to an increase in preload and a subsequent increase in stroke volume (Frank-Starling mechanism). As a result of this process, systolic pressure is increased in both the aorta (N = 90–140 mm Hg) and the LV (N = 90–140 mm Hg). In chronic AR, eccentric hypertrophy in the LV increases LV compliance, which helps to maintain a normal LV diastolic pressure (N = 5–12 mm Hg) despite the increased LVEDV. Patients with acute AR in whom eccentric hypertrophy has not yet occurred, or patients with decompensated chronic AR in whom there is LV systolic failure, may experience increased LV diastolic pressure.

In AS, the left-ventricular end-systolic volume (top left) is greater than normal because outflow is impeded by the narrowed aortic valve, and the end-diastolic volume (bottom right) is slightly greater than normal due to the increase in residual volume from the previous systole. The stroke volume (the width of the pressure-volume loop) is less than normal because the mild increase in end-diastolic volume does not lead to sufficient preload to overcome the increased opening resistance of the stenotic valve. However, in mild aortic stenosis, the increased preload (increased end-diastolic volume) can result in a more forceful contraction (due to the Frank-Starling mechanism), such that the stroke volume is not decreased. The peak systolic pressure also rises far above normal in order to overcome the high vascular resistance and turbulent blood flow created by the stenosed aortic valve. In contrast to this patient's auscultation findings, AS would classically manifest with a harsh crescendo-decrescendo late systolic murmur best heard over the second right intercostal space.","bool":false},{"option":"B","explanation":"Graph B indicates mitral regurgitation (MR). The left-ventricular end-diastolic volume (bottom right) is increased because each subsequent diastolic filling includes the normal left atrial volume of blood as well as regurgitated blood from the previous cycle.

There is no true isovolumetric contraction phase in the mitral regurgitation pressure-volume loop, as blood flows back to the left atrium during contraction of the ventricle before the aortic valve opens (top right). The stroke volume is divided between the output through the aortic valve and through the abnormal regurgitant mitral valve, causing a reduced afterload (↓ outflow resistance) and smaller end-systolic volume (top left).

This ventricular volume overload results in an increased preload, which increases the stroke volume (via the Frank-Starling mechanism). This is apparent in the widened pressure-volume loop. There is no true isovolumetric relaxation phase because, when the left ventricle begins to relax following aortic valve closure (top left), blood flows backwards from the aorta into the left ventricle.

It shows decreased volume at end-diastole (bottom right), a direct result of the narrowed mitral valve opening. According to the Frank-Starling law, a lowered end-diastolic volume leads to reduced left ventricular preload, resulting in decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. This is apparent in the narrowed pressure-volume loop. A decrease in stroke volume, in turn, reduces the afterload imposed on the left ventricle (via reduction of aortic pressure).

The resulting hypoxia becomes evident, especially during exertion. Another early clinical finding is the presence of a brachial-femoral delay (i.e., a delayed femoral pulse when compared with the radial or brachial pulse). Delayed manifestations of aortic coarctation include radiographic evidence of collateral circulation (e.g., rib notching) and left ventricular hypertrophy.\nDoppler echocardiography is the confirmatory test of choice; it can identify the location and extent of the stenosis and show concurrent anomalies, such as a bicuspid aortic valve (present in ∼ 60% of cases).","bool":true},{"option":"Rib notching","explanation":"\nNotching of the ribs can be visualized on x-ray in patients with coarctation of the aorta, such as this boy, when compensatory collateral blood flow involves the intercostal vessels.

Nitroglycerin dilates smooth muscle cells in both arteries and veins, which in turn reduces myocardial preload, decreases myocardial oxygen demand, and subsequently provides symptom relief.","answers":[{"option":"End-diastolic pressure","explanation":"The administration of nitroglycerin causes smooth muscle relaxation in the vascular system, predominantly in the venous system. It thus increases venous pooling which subsequently decreases myocardial preload. This results in a decreased end-diastolic pressure, which decreases myocardial wall tension and thus improves myocardial perfusion while decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. The shift towards a more favorable ratio of perfusion to demand is the primary mechanism through which symptom relief is achieved.","bool":true},{"option":"Venous pooling","explanation":"Decreased venous pooling can result from the use of compression stockings or sympathomimetic drugs that cause vasoconstriction of arteriolar and venous vasculature. This increases venous return and therefore cardiac preload, which in turn increases myocardial wall tension and reduces myocardial perfusion. Nitroglycerin has the opposite effect: Smooth muscle relaxation, mainly of the venous vessels, leads to venodilation and subsequent increased blood pooling in the venous system.","bool":false},{"option":"Electrical conduction speed","explanation":"\nNitroglycerin has no effect on electrical conduction. Reducing the electrical conduction speed, and thus heart rate, is a mechanism to achieve a long-term reduction of myocardial oxygen demand.

In later stages that are refractory to common treatment, ranolazine can be added to target late inward sodium channels within myocardial tissue and provide relief in some cases of chronic angina.","bool":false},{"option":"Coronary arterial resistance","explanation":"\nNitroglycerin does cause coronary arterial vasodilation, in addition to vasodilation throughout the body. However, nitroglycerin predominantly targets the venous system and coronary dilation is not the primary mechanism of improving myocardial perfusion. In angina, the coronary arteries are typically in a chronic state of dilation in an attempt to preserve perfusion of the myocardial tissue (= decreased coronary reserve). In these cases, nitroglycerin provides no additional increase in blood flow to the coronary arteries but can still achieve symptom relief via a different mechanism.","bool":false},{"option":"Peripheral arterial resistance","explanation":"The decrease in peripheral arterial resistance is achieved through arterial vasodilation, which is one of the effects of nitroglycerin.

Because it can take 6–14 days for troponin T levels to return to normal, a single measurement of elevated troponin T level 3 days after MI does not allow for reliable differentiation between a prior infarct and reinfarction. However, a second measurement 3–6 hours later showing a 20% increase in troponin T levels indicates reinfarction in the presence of suggestive symptoms. Creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) measurement can help in the evaluation of reinfarction because of its short half-life (return to normal within 2–3 days), but it is no longer commonly used. In addition, an ECG should be obtained immediately in every patient with suspected MI.\nAtypical features (i.e., no or minimal chest pain, nausea) of MI are more common in older people, individuals with diabetes, and women.

Also, patients with diabetic neuropathy have warm extremities and palpable foot pulses, which this patient does not have.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Duplex ultrasonography","explanation":"Duplex sonography is the best initial test in suspected acute limb ischemia (ALI), which may manifest with coolness and decreased pulses in the leg, and is likely in a patient with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking) and a history of heart disease (i.e., atrial fibrillation). However, the onset of ALI is typically acute, involving severe, acute pain, paresthesia, and weakness of the leg.

This patient has a constant RR interval and clearly discernible P waves on ECG, making atrial fibrillation unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute posterior myocardial infarction","explanation":"An acute posterior myocardial infarction (MI) can be diagnosed based on the presence of ST elevations on special leads V7–V9. On a standard 12-lead ECG, a posterior MI manifests with reciprocal ST depression in leads V1–V4 or an R:S wave ratio &gt; 1 in leads V1 and V2 due to an increase in the R wave amplitude. This patient only has an ST depression in lead V2 and an R:S ratio &lt; 1 in leads V1 and V2.

Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's current condition?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Congenital heart defects associated with Down syndrome include atrioventricular, ventricular, and atrial septal defects.","answers":[{"option":"Right ventricular hypertrophy","explanation":"\nCentral cyanosis, weakness, and clubbing in a patient with a history of Down syndrome are highly suggestive of Eisenmenger syndrome due to a congenital heart defect, most likely an endocardial or atrioventricular cushion defect. Both of these defects initially cause a left-to-right blood shunt (i.e., acyanotic heart defect) due to higher pressures within the left heart. Over time, the increased blood flow within the right heart and the pulmonary vasculature results in permanent remodeling of pulmonary vessels and right ventricular hypertrophy. The right ventricular pressure eventually becomes higher (normal 5–10 mmHg) than the left ventricular pressure, causing a reversal of the shunt and cyanosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Reversible pulmonary hypertension","explanation":"\nPulmonary hypertension is a manifestation of acyanotic heart defects, which are the result of a left-to-right shunt. The increased volume of the shunted blood causes a remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, leading to pulmonary hypertension. This patient most likely has pulmonary hypertension but this is an irreversible process, not reversible.","bool":false},{"option":"Intrapulmonary shunting","explanation":"Intrapulmonary shunting occurs in situations where parts of the lungs are perfused but not ventilated, resulting in a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Some common conditions that can cause intrapulmonary shunt include pulmonary AVM, hepatopulmonary syndrome, severe cases of pulmonary edema, and lobar atelectasis. This patient's history of Down syndrome makes an underlying congenital heart defect a more likely cause of his condition, rather than a pulmonary condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Asymmetric septal hypertrophy","explanation":"\nAsymmetric septal hypertrophy is seen in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), a hereditary condition that can manifest with fatigue and an increased atrial pressure. However, HOCM would not manifest with central cyanosis, digital clubbing, and increased right atrial pressure (the left side is more commonly involved). This patient's history of Down syndrome makes a different etiology more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Aortic valve regurgitation","explanation":"\nAortic valve regurgitation is most commonly seen in connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome. Backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle would result in left ventricular hypertrophy and increased left atrial pressure rather than increased right atrial pressure. In addition, aortic valve regurgitation presents with fatigue but not with clubbing and cyanosis.

This patient's current condition is most likely to cause which of the following findings on cardiac examination?","difficulty":5,"hint":"ST-segment elevations in leads I, aVL, and V1–V6 are consistent with anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI). Nonspecific signs and symptoms (e.g., nausea, abdominal pain in the absence of chest pain) are more common in older people, individuals with diabetes, and women.","answers":[{"option":"Atrial gallop","explanation":"An atrial gallop (S4) results from atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle. It is frequently heard in the acute phase of an MI because of impaired relaxation of the ischemic left ventricle. An S4  may also be heard in conditions that cause ventricular hypertrophy, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, or hypertension. Older patients can have an S4 as a normal finding because ventricular compliance decreases with age.\nA ventricular gallop (S3), on the other hand, is caused by a sudden deceleration of blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle during early diastole. This finding can be normal in young adults (&lt; 40 years) or pregnant women, but it is abnormal in older adults. An S3 may be heard in dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or valvular diseases such as chronic mitral or aortic regurgitation. It is not a common finding in acute MI.\n\n","bool":true},{"option":"Fixed-split S2 sound","explanation":"A fixed-split S2 sound is associated with atrial septal defects. Blood shifts from the left atrium to the right atrium, which increases right ventricular preload across all phases of the respiratory cycle. As a result, the pulmonic valve consistently closes after the aortic valve. A fixed-split S2 is not a finding seen in acute MI.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated jugular venous pressure","explanation":"Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) results from increased pressure in the right atrium and is indicative of increased right ventricular pressure. It commonly occurs in right heart failure, tension pneumothorax, pulmonary artery hypertension, and constrictive pericarditis. It is not a common finding in acute MI. Anterior MI affects the left ventricle, not the right, and therefore may cause acute pulmonary edema due to left ventricular dysfunction, but it is unlikely to manifest with elevated JVP.","bool":false},{"option":"Decrescendo diastolic murmur","explanation":"A decrescendo diastolic murmur is associated with aortic regurgitation (AR), which is most commonly idiopathic but may also result from syphilis aortitis, infective endocarditis, and connective tissue diseases. It is not a common finding in acute anterior MI. A more common auscultatory finding in a patient with acute MI would be the holosystolic (not diastolic) murmur associated with mitral regurgitation. This valvular dysfunction is due to papillary muscle rupture and is more commonly seen in a right coronary artery occlusion causing infarction of the posteromedial papillary muscle.","bool":false},{"option":"Mid-systolic click","explanation":"A mid-systolic click is associated with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). MVP is most commonly diagnosed on physical examination of an asymptomatic patient. It may also occur in patients with a history of rheumatic fever, connective tissue disease, or infective endocarditis.","bool":false},{"option":"Muffled heart sounds","explanation":"Muffled or distant heart sounds are features of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.

The triad of back or abdominal pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass indicates a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\n\n","answers":[{"option":"Open emergency surgery","explanation":"Open emergency surgery is the most appropriate next step for this patient who most likely has an AAA rupture. The findings of hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea indicate that this patient is in severe hemorrhagic shock. In a hemodynamically unstable patient with a high clinical suspicion for ruptured AAA, treatment should not be delayed for any confirmatory imaging. An alternative to open surgery is endovascular aneurysm repair, which is recommended over open surgery in current guidelines if it is anatomically feasible. Without immediate repair, AAA rupture is usually fatal within hours.","bool":true},{"option":"CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast","explanation":"A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast would be an appropriate confirmatory test in a hemodynamically stable patient with a suspected AAA rupture, especially when other conditions might explain the findings, e.g., bowel ischemia or perforation. However, this patient already has a classic triad of a ruptured AAA and signs of severe hemorrhagic shock. Imaging must not delay definitive treatment.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam therapy","explanation":"Intravenous antibiotic therapy, e.g., a regimen of ampicillin and sulbactam, would be appropriate for treating a patient with uncomplicated diverticulitis after imaging studies (e.g., abdominal CT) have established the diagnosis. In some cases, diverticulitis may cause septic shock, which could resemble this patient's condition. However, diverticulitis is usually a local colonic infection that presents with subacute nonradiating LLQ pain, signs of systemic infection (e.g., fever), and in the case of peritonitis, abdominal guarding, none of which are present in this patient. Regardless, if this patient did have septic shock secondary to diverticulitis, emergency surgery would likely be necessary to control the infectious focus rather than a course of IV antibiotics.\n\n\n","bool":false},{"option":"Transfusion of packed red blood cells","explanation":"\nTransfusion of packed RBCs will very likely be required for this patient in order to offset intravascular blood volume loss. In fact, in any patient with a ruptured AAA, at least 10 units of packed RBCs should be ready for likely transfusion intraoperatively, as these patients lose significant amounts of blood. While a blood transfusion may temporarily help to counter volume loss, this patient needs immediate definitive treatment to contain further bleeding.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Supine and erect x-rays of the abdomen","explanation":"\nSupine and erect x-rays of the abdomen would be the most appropriate next step if a perforated viscus or bowel obstruction were suspected. This patient's PUD and aspirin use put him at risk of a ruptured ulcer. However, his history is not consistent with an active ulcer given his use of pantoprazole as well as the absence of any recent epigastric pain or abdominal distention and rigidity. Although the patient has signs of bowel obstruction (vomiting, no bowel movement in three days), it is less likely than AAA because obstructions usually have worsening pain over hours to days and would not cause sudden hemodynamic instability.\n","bool":false}]},{"id":218,"info":"Cardiovascular System","question":"A 74-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of shortness of breath and leg swelling.

Immunoglobulins can deposit in any organ, including the heart, in which case they cause a specific type of restrictive cardiomyopathy known as infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Thickening of the myocardium results in diastolic dysfunction and back-flow of blood causes shortness of breath, jugular venous distention, and pulmonary edema, which are all seen here.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Iron deposition","explanation":"\nIron deposition can lead to restrictive cardiomyopathy (although dilated cardiomyopathy is more common). Hemochromatosis is one condition that is associated with a high iron state.

Hypercalcemia can have a wide range of findings, including constipation, bone pains, and psychiatric mood disorders. Cardiomyopathy, however, is not caused by hypercalcemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Chronic vasoconstriction","explanation":"Chronic vasoconstriction can develop in long-term cocaine use and is due to alpha-1 receptor stimulation. Cocaine is toxic to the myocardium, causes myocardial thinning, and can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy (usually seen on echocardiography).

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current condition?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This axial CT shows an ascending aortic aneurysm, which is often associated with an aortic regurgitation murmur (diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border) caused by dilation of the aortic valve annulus. Dissection of the weakened aneurysmal wall can cause an acute increase in the size of an aneurysm, manifesting with back pain, discordant blood pressure readings in the upper limbs, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia aortica due to esophageal compression).","answers":[{"option":"Cystic medial degeneration","explanation":"This patient's tall stature and pectus excavatum suggest Marfan syndrome. Individuals with Marfan syndrome have hypermobile joints, which predisposes them to chronic arthralgia as a result of recurrent sprains, bursitis, and/or early-onset osteoarthritis. Cystic medial degeneration, which occurs with aging and in connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, leads to the weakening of the aortic wall and aneurysmal dilation, which are seen here.","bool":true},{"option":"Atheroma formation","explanation":"Weakening of the vessel wall due to atheroma formation (atherosclerosis) is the most common cause of an aortic aneurysm, and the marfanoid features in this patient (e.g., tall stature, pectus excavatum) might be due to homocystinuria, which is a risk factor for early-onset atherosclerosis. However, aneurysms due to atherosclerosis typically occur in the thoracic segment and the abdominal segment of the descending aorta. The ascending aortic aneurysm in this patient suggests a different pathologic process.","bool":false},{"option":"Protozoal infection","explanation":"Infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, which is endemic to South America. This disease can cause dysphagia (due to achalasia) as well as aortic regurgitation (due to dilated cardiomyopathy), which are seen here. However, Chagas disease would not cause pectus excavatum, discordant blood pressure readings, or dilation of the aorta.","bool":false},{"option":"Granulomatous inflammation","explanation":"\nGranulomatous inflammation is seen in giant cell arteritis (GCA), which predisposes to the formation of ascending aortic aneurysms and can present with back and shoulder pain (due to concurrent polymyalgia rheumatica). However, aortic aneurysm usually occurs late in the course of GCA and the disease virtually never affects patients &lt; 50 years.\nGranulomatous inflammation is also seen in Takayasu arteritis, which can lead to chronic arthralgia and discordant blood pressure readings between the upper limbs (due to aortic arch narrowing). Takayasu arteritis can, occasionally, lead to aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta with aortic regurgitation and dysphagia, which is seen here. However, the condition typically occurs in Asian women and would usually be associated with other features, such as cutaneous nodules, fever, or night sweats.","bool":false},{"option":"Congenital aortic narrowing","explanation":"Congenital narrowing of the aortic arch (aortic coarctation) can cause discordant blood pressure readings in the limbs. Additionally, a bicuspid aortic valve, which is commonly associated with aortic coarctation, can lead to aortic regurgitation (diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border), which is seen here. However, in the case of aortic coarctation, the discordance is usually between the blood pressure measurements of the upper and lower extremities because the coarctation is typically located just distal to the left subclavian artery. Only in very rare instances would aortic coarctation cause disparate blood pressure measurements in the arms. Furthermore, this condition would not be expected to cause significant dilation of the ascending aorta.","bool":false},{"option":"Systemic fibroblast proliferation","explanation":"Systemic fibroblast proliferation is a pathologic process that occurs in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), which can cause dysphagia (due to esophageal dysmotility), chronic arthralgia, and vascular disease. Dysphagia due to SSc usually has a subacute or chronic onset. In addition, arthralgia caused by SSc typically affects the small joints of the hands and feet, and the vasculopathy associated with SSc manifests as Raynaud phenomenon, telangiectasia, or thromboembolic phenomena. Furthermore, SS would not cause pectus excavatum, discordant blood pressure readings, aortic regurgitation, or dilation of the ascending aorta.","bool":false},{"option":"Autoimmune valve damage","explanation":"Autoimmune valve damage is the cause of rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which, in the US, is most commonly seen in the immigrant population. RHD can cause a diastolic murmur (due to mitral stenosis), and, rarely, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia megalatriensis due to left atrial enlargement). Rheumatic fever, which is the pathologic precursor to RHD, would also cause pain in large joints such as the knee. However, the joint pain would subside after the acute episode of rheumatic fever, and the diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis would be heard best at the cardiac apex. This patient's murmur is caused by aortic regurgitation, which is not common in RHD.

This patient, who is a heavy smoker with chronic cough and dyspnea, diffuse expiratory wheezes, and pulmonary hyperinflation (distant heart sounds), has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD causes chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and, over time, irreversible remodeling of the walls of the pulmonary arteries, resulting in group 3 PH. In a patient with COPD, a right ventricular strain pattern on ECG or worsening dyspnea or exercise intolerance with stable spirometry findings should raise suspicion for PH. If PH is left untreated, the chronically elevated right ventricular afterload will eventually result in RVF. The best initial test in a case of suspected PH is Doppler echocardiography, which can provide an estimate of PAP. Right heart catheterization is subsequently required to confirm the diagnosis by accurately measuring PAP and PVR.\nThe causes of PH are classified into five groups: (1) idiopathic or hereditary, (2) left-sided heart disease, (3) chronic hypoxic lung disease, (4) chronic thromboembolism (CTEPH), and (5) unclear multifactorial mechanisms.","bool":true},{"option":"Chronic malnutrition","explanation":"This patient's heavy alcohol use is a risk factor for chronic malnutrition, which can cause fluid retention as a result of hypoalbuminemia (in protein-energy malnutrition) and/or congestive cardiomyopathy (in thiamine and/or selenium deficiency).

Other causes of venous air embolism include vascular interventions (e.g., insertion or removal of central venous catheters), penetrating lung injuries, and barotrauma. Management procedures depend on the suspected site of embolism and include compression of the suspected entry site, correction of hypoxia and hypotension, and placing the patient in a head-down position (e.g., Trendelenburg position) or in the left lateral decubitus position (Durant maneuver), both of which help trap the air emboli in the right ventricular apex and therefore prevent further obstruction of the pulmonary outflow tract.

Ischemic stroke is primarily caused by large artery atherosclerosis (for which hypertension is a major risk factor), whereas hemorrhagic stroke is most often due to rupture of vessels that have been damaged by chronic arterial hypertension. The most significant nonmodifiable risk factor is age &gt; 65 years. Other important predisposing factors for ischemic stroke include conditions that increase the thromboembolic risk such as diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and carotid artery stenosis. Risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke include conditions that lead to vascular damage, such as vasculitis, malignancy, and previous ischemic stroke.\nThis patient's risk for hypertension-related stroke is further elevated because his blood pressure is not optimally controlled. According to current recommendations by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, blood pressure should not exceed a maximum of &lt; 130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes mellitus.","bool":true},{"option":"Hyperlipidemia","explanation":"\nHyperlipidemia can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis by forming plaques in the tunica intima of arterial walls. Atherosclerosis, in turn, causes intraluminal narrowing and obstruction of arteries and may lead to stroke.

Although type 2 diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for stroke, it is not the strongest one.","bool":false},{"option":"Obesity","explanation":"\nObesity is both an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including stroke, and is closely associated with a variety of other cardiovascular risk factors. While an important modifiable risk factor, obesity is not the strongest risk factor for stroke.","bool":false},{"option":"Tobacco use","explanation":"Smoking is an important risk factor for stroke, especially for ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Smoking causes vascular damage, most likely due to an increase in platelet aggregation and fibrinogen levels, a reduction of HDL cholesterol levels, and direct vascular toxic effects of certain tobacco compounds. Although this patient has a considerable risk of vascular damage due to his long history of tobacco use, smoking alone does not have the strongest association with the development of stroke.","bool":false},{"option":"Excessive alcohol intake","explanation":"Excessive, regular consumption of alcohol increases the risk for a number of conditions, which are themselves risk factors for stroke. Alcohol can raise blood pressure, promote insulin resistance, cause obesity, and trigger atrial fibrillation with an increased risk for thromboembolic events. Alcohol hepatotoxicity (e.g., cirrhosis) can also lead to insufficient synthesis of coagulation factors and promote hemorrhagic events. This patient's alcohol use considerably increases his risk for stroke but is not the single strongest predisposing factor.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased stress","explanation":"How psychological or emotional stress, especially if experienced over long periods of time, increases the risk for stroke is complex and still subject to research. Likely pathomechanisms include inflammatory processes directly affecting the arteries, as well as increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines which promote the development of atherosclerosis. However, the physical impact of stress varies greatly from person to person and does not have the strongest association with the development of stroke.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Positive family history","explanation":"A positive family history for stroke suggests a possible genetic predisposition for the development of risk factors for stroke, e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia.

An x-ray of the chest is shown below. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The boot-shaped heart on this boy's x-ray is caused by right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). His harsh, systolic murmur heard over the left upper sternal border is caused by pulmonary stenosis. These findings, along with his acute hypoxic spells (which cause cyanosis), indicate a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).","answers":[{"option":"Right ventricular outflow obstruction","explanation":"\nRight ventricular outflow obstruction (RVOO) in this patient is caused by pulmonary stenosis, which is one of the components of TOF, along with RVH, an overriding aorta, and a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Exertion, such as crying or feeding, increases the RVOO. This results in cyanosis (tet spells) due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the VSD instead of the pulmonary valve, which in turn causes the murmur to become softer. The right ventricle hypertrophies because it chronically pumps against high resistance caused by the RVOO.\nOlder children with TOF tend to squat during a tet spell. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which increases left ventricular pressure and decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood through the VSD. Infants who are having a tet spell should be placed with their knees toward their chest to achieve the same effect.","bool":true},{"option":"Anatomic reversal of aorta and pulmonary artery","explanation":"Anatomic reversal of the aorta and pulmonary artery is known as transposition of the great vessels (TGV). This condition causes cyanosis because the aorta arises from the right ventricle and thus results in systemic circulation of deoxygenated blood. However, unlike this patient, cyanosis in TGV manifests immediately after birth. Additionally, chest x-ray in TGV shows an egg-on-a-string appearance due to an enlarged heart with a narrowed mediastinum, which resembles an egg lying on its side.","bool":false},{"option":"Tricuspid valve regurgitation","explanation":"\nTricuspid regurgitation (TR) in infants is usually due to a malformed and displaced tricuspid valve in Ebstein anomaly. These infants may develop cyanosis only if there's an associated ASD or PFO that allows for right-to-left shunting of blood. Auscultation would reveal a holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border, like in this patient, with a widely split S2. However, a chest x-ray in Ebstein anomaly will show right atrial enlargement (due to chronic reflux of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium) - not a boot-shaped heart as seen in this infant.","bool":false},{"option":"Persistent connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery","explanation":"A persistent connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery characterizes a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), an acyanotic heart defect that can cause cyanosis if Eisenmenger syndrome develops. However, patients with a PDA and Eisenmenger syndrome typically develop differential cyanosis because right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus delivers unoxygenated blood distal to the left subclavian artery. Additionally, PDA causes a continuous, machine-like murmur heard throughout systole and diastole (unlike this patient's systolic murmur), and chest x-ray shows a prominent mediastinum caused by an enlarged pulmonary artery and aortic knob (not a boot-shaped heart).","bool":false},{"option":"Narrowing of the distal aortic arch","explanation":"Narrowing of the distal aortic arch, or coarctation of the aorta, manifests variably depending on the degree of aortic stenosis (AS) and the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Patients with significant AS and PDA present with differential cyanosis because right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus delivers unoxygenated blood distal to the left subclavian artery. Once the PDA closes (usually within a few days after birth), heart failure develops and manifests as dyspnea, sweating during feeds, and poor weight gain. Examination shows pallor (rather than cyanosis), features of inadequate left ventricular output (absent or weak femoral pulses, brachio-femoral delay), and signs of right heart failure (e.g., raised jugular venous pressure, edema, and hepatomegaly). Chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary venous markings, not a boot-shaped heart.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypoplasia of the left ventricle","explanation":"\nHypoplasia of the left ventricle is caused by hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a heart condition that is typically acyanotic in the early postnatal period because a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ensures systemic perfusion. Cyanosis develops when the PDA closes, usually within a few days of birth (not as late as 3 months as in this case). Neonates with HLHS also have weak peripheral pulses, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis as the hypoplastic left ventricle cannot maintain adequate cardiac output. Additionally, HLHS does not cause a murmur, and findings on chest x-ray are variable (e.g., small, normal, or enlarged heart and increased pulmonary venous markings) but do not include a boot-shaped heart.","bool":false}]},{"id":233,"info":"Cardiovascular System","question":"A 44-year-old woman comes to the office because of 4 episodes of loss of consciousness over the past 2 weeks.

MS commonly occurs as a late complication of rheumatic fever, which is more common in developing countries where patients may not have been adequately treated.","answers":[{"option":"Increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure","explanation":"\nMitral stenosis leads to elevated left atrial pressure, which can trigger atrial fibrillation and cause increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Over time, the increased PCWP leads to remodeling of the pulmonary arteries, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, an S2 split, and right ventricular hypertrophy (seen as right axis deviation). In MS, shorter interval between the opening snap and S2 indicates more severe disease. This is because left atrial pressure is greater than left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased oxygenated blood in the right ventricle","explanation":"Increased oxygenated blood in the right ventricle may be present in patients with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or an atrial septal defect (ASD) due to left-to-right shunting.

Arterial embolisms most commonly originate from a cardiac thrombus, which typically forms if there is intracardiac blood stasis (e.g., due to atrial fibrillation or complications of myocardial infarction such as noncontractile myocardium or ventricular aneurysm). This patient’s sensory loss and muscle weakness strongly suggest that the right limb is under immediate threat. Management of ALI in a viable or threatened limb begins with an IV heparin bolus followed by continuous infusion and emergent revascularization (via catheter-directed thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thromboembolectomy, or open thromboembolectomy) to restore blood flow to the extremity.\nALI most commonly results from the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque or thrombosis in a previously stenotic but patent artery, such as those in patients with PAD.

A faint holosystolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border is consistent with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD).","answers":[{"option":"Decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance","explanation":"\nPulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high in utero and decreases over the first few weeks of life. The progressive decrease in PVR and subsequent decrease in right ventricular pressure lead to increased left-to-right blood flow across the VSD. The enhanced shunting increases the overall volume of blood in pulmonary circulation, which causes increased lung perfusion (as evidenced by increased pulmonary vascular markings), increased pulmonary venous return to the left atrium, and left ventricular volume overload (resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy as evidenced on this patient's ECG and chest x-ray). By the age of 2–3 months, these events can lead to heart failure without cyanosis, as seen in this child.\nIf the VSD is not repaired and pulmonary blood flow continues to be high, vascular remodeling in later stages will cause PVR to increase again, resulting first in right ventricular hypertrophy and persistent pulmonary hypertension and, eventually, shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome) resulting in heart failure with cyanosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Persistent pulmonary hypertension","explanation":"\nPersistent pulmonary hypertension in a patient with a VSD (which is initially a left-to-right shunt) could cause a shunt reversal (Eisenmenger reaction). However, Eisenmenger reaction is associated with cyanosis and right ventricular hypertrophy, and typically only occurs after a left-to-right shunt has persisted for an extended amount of time (usually many years).

To maintain an adequate cardiac output despite regurgitation, initially, there is a compensatory increase in stroke volume. Over time, the increased LV end-diastolic volume leads to LV enlargement and eccentric myocardial hypertrophy. Patients may be asymptomatic for decades despite progressive LV dilation. In chronic AR, this compensatory response results in left ventricular dysfunction, and patients develop signs and symptoms of left heart failure (exertional and nocturnal dyspnea, S3 gallop). The diagnosis of AR should be confirmed with transthoracic echocardiography.\nManeuvers that increase afterload (e.g., handgrip) increase the intensity of the associated murmur as a result of the enlargement of regurgitation volume across the valve.","bool":true},{"option":"Mitral valve stenosis","explanation":"\nMitral stenosis (MS) can cause dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea.

As a consequence of sympathetic blockade (primarily β1 receptors), the conduction velocity through the AV node is reduced and the heart rate slows. Decreased AV nodal conduction would be evident on ECG as an increased PR interval. Class III antiarrhythmic effects of sotalol include increased myocyte action potential duration (due to delayed repolarization caused by decreased K+ efflux), increased effective refractory period, and prolonged QT interval.\nDecreased AV nodal conduction is also caused by non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV antiarrhythmics), class IC antiarrhythmics (e.g., flecainide, propafenone), digoxin, and adenosine.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased K+ efflux from myocytes","explanation":"\nHyperpolarization due to increased K+ efflux from myocytes is the mechanism of action of adenosine. Adenosine is used in the acute setting to terminate stable paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) such as AVNRT and AVRT, which are typically regular narrow complex tachycardias. Adenosine should not be used to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) because it worsens AF. This patient received sotalol, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, which would slow the rate of repolarization by decreasing K+ efflux from the myocyte.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased myocyte inotropy","explanation":"Increased myocyte inotropy is caused by digoxin, which can be used to treat atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure.

In this patient with an immigration history from an endemic region and a prolonged history of night sweats, fever, and cough, the most likely etiology of constrictive pericarditis is tuberculosis.","answers":[{"option":"Jugular venous distention on inspiration","explanation":"Normally, the decrease in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration expands the compliant right ventricle, resulting in a decrease in jugular venous pressure. In constrictive pericarditis, compliance of the right ventricle is decreased and the right ventricle fails to expand during inspiration. This, alongside a possible increase in baseline jugular venous pressure in constrictive pericarditis due to restricted right ventricular filling during late diastole, leads to an increase in jugular venous pressure during inspiration, and therefore, jugular venous distention on inspiration. This phenomenon, which is called Kussmaul sign, can also be seen in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy and right atrial or ventricular tumors. Management options for constrictive pericarditis include NSAIDs, colchicine, glucocorticoids, pericardiectomy, and treatment of the underlying condition (e.g., antitubercular or immunomodulatory therapy).\nIn cardiac tamponade without underlying pericarditis (e.g., traumatic hemopericardium), the jugular venous pressure is increased as a result of impaired right ventricular filling. However, the right ventricle is still compliant and a decrease in intrathoracic pressure can be transmitted to the right ventricle across the fluid-filled pericardial sac. Kussmaul sign would not be expected in traumatic cardiac tamponade.","bool":true},{"option":"Crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur","explanation":"A crescendo-decrescendo (diamond-shaped) systolic ejection murmur best heard in the second right intercostal space is a common finding in aortic stenosis (AS). While severe, long-standing AS can result in chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea, orthopnea, and cough (due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema), fever and night sweats are not commonly seen.

It is caused by the early closure of the aortic valve (A2) in relation to the pulmonary valve (P2) when intrathoracic pressure is decreased. In conditions such as aortic stenosis (AS), ventricular septal defect with Eisenmenger syndrome, and left bundle branch block, elimination of S2 splitting can occur because A2 is delayed and superimposed on P2. Although severe, long-standing aortic stenosis can result in fatigue, dyspnea, orthopnea, and cough (due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema), chronic AS is not associated with fever or night sweats but with symptoms such as syncope, palpitations, and angina. Moreover, an x-ray would not show pericardial calcifications but an enlarged cardiac silhouette.","bool":false},{"option":"Head bobbing in synchrony with heart beat","explanation":"Rhythmic nodding or bobbing of the head in synchronicity with the heartbeat is referred to as de Musset sign, a typical feature of chronic aortic regurgitation (AR). AR may present with progressively worsening fatigue, dyspnea, orthopnea, and cough (due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema). However, chronic AR is not associated with fever or night sweats, and an x-ray would not show pericardial calcifications, but rather a prominent aortic root and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.","bool":false},{"option":"Painless erythematous lesions on palms or soles","explanation":"Painless erythematous lesions on the palms or soles (Janeway lesions) are highly suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE), which can manifest with dyspnea, fatigue, cough, fever, and night sweats.

A prominent “a” wave is a sign of increased atrial contraction pressure due to restricted filling of the right ventricle (e.g., tricuspid valve stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac tamponade). In constrictive pericarditis, right ventricular filling is only impaired when the elastic limit of the pericardium is reached.

Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard over the left lower sternal border. A single S2 that does not split with respiration is present.

Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?","difficulty":4,"hint":"In this cyanotic neonate, an imperforate atrioventricular septum in the right side confirms the diagnosis of tricuspid valve atresia (TVA).","answers":[{"option":"Left-axis deviation on electrocardiogram","explanation":"In TVA, blood is unable to pass from the right atrium (RA) to the right ventricle (RV). Consequently, the RV is almost always hypoplastic. Venous blood, therefore, passes from the RA via an atrial septal defect (which, under these circumstances, is essential for survival) to the left atrium, where it mixes with oxygenated blood from the lungs. The mixed blood is pumped from the left ventricle (LV) into the systemic circulation (resulting in cyanosis) and pulmonary circulation (via a patent ductus arteriosus). LV hypertrophy occurs because the LV is single-handedly pumping blood through both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. A combination of RV hypoplasia and LV hypertrophy results in a severe left-axis deviation. Other findings that may be present on ECG include tall P waves (due to right atrial enlargement) and small R waves in the right precordial leads (e.g., V1, V2).\nThe majority of patients with TVA also have a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and concomitant pulmonary outflow obstruction. The systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border arises from a VSD. In a patient with TVA, a single S2 that does not split with respiration indicates severely limited blood flow across the pulmonary valve and/or severe pulmonary stenosis. The systolic murmur of a VSD is softer with increasing severity of pulmonary stenosis and/or increasing size of the defect, because both result in a decreased pressure gradient across the VSD. Prostaglandin-E1 is given to maintain PDA patency (thereby increasing pulmonary circulation and blood oxygenation), but definitive treatment is staged surgical repair.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased pulmonary vascular markings on chest x-ray","explanation":"Increased pulmonary vascular markings on chest x-ray due to pulmonary vascular congestion is seen in certain cyanotic congenital heart defects such as transposition of the great arteries (TGA), which would manifest with postnatal cyanosis, tachypnea, and a single loud S2. However, echocardiography revealed tricuspid atresia, in which pulmonary blood flow and thus pulmonary vascular markings are decreased because of the concomitant pulmonary outflow tract obstruction.\nIn approximately 25% of cases of tricuspid valve atresia, no pulmonary stenosis is present. In these patients, the presence of a large, nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD) or a concomitant TGA may result in increased pulmonary blood flow and increased pulmonary markings. However, in those cases, auscultation would reveal a wide split S2.","bool":false},{"option":"Delta wave on electrocardiogram","explanation":"A delta wave on ECG (slurred R upstroke) is characteristic of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW).

However, a wide split S2 is typically present in Ebstein anomaly, not a single S2. Moreover, Ebstein anomaly is classically associated with fetal lithium or benzodiazepine exposure, of which there is no history here (e.g., a maternal history of bipolar disorder). The absence of a tricuspid valve on echocardiography indicates a different diagnosis.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Rib notching on chest x-ray","explanation":"Collateral circulation and tortuous dilation of the posterior intercostal arteries can result in notching of the ribs in patients with coarctation of the aorta, for which there is no evidence (e.g., forward diastolic flow, narrowing of the aortic lumen) in this patient. In neonates, severe coarctation of the aorta can result in cyanosis (due to a right-to-left shunt via a patent ductus arteriosus), but it would only be present in the lower limbs and trunk (differential cyanosis); the upper limbs, lips, and face would appear normal. Moreover, rib notching typically occurs in patients with long-standing coarctation of the aorta and is unusual before the age of 5 years.","bool":false},{"option":"Tracheal bowing on chest x-ray","explanation":"\nTracheal bowing and narrowing on an x-ray is characteristic of a double aortic arch, which may manifest with cyanosis and tachypnea due to respiratory distress among newborns as a result of tracheal compression.

This patient's x-ray findings are strongly suggestive of a TAA, which can manifest with chest discomfort and cough due to compression of the tracheobronchial tree (although most TAAs are asymptomatic, and this patient's cough may be a sequela of his recent upper respiratory tract infection). However, a chest x-ray cannot accurately determine the underlying cause of mediastinal widening. CTA is the best confirmatory test for TAAs, delineates the size and length of the TAA, and detects complications (e.g., thrombus formation, free/contained TAA rupture), thereby providing valuable information for planning management. MR angiography is a reasonable alternative to CTA in hemodynamically stable patients who should avoid ionizing radiation.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Reassurance","explanation":"Reassurance is an appropriate option if the cause of the widened mediastinum on a chest x-ray is aortic unfolding, the most common cause of this finding in older adults.

The presence of an early diastolic murmur and widened pulse pressure indicate aortic regurgitation (AR).","answers":[{"option":"Water hammer pulse","explanation":"A water hammer pulse is a classic finding on cardiovascular examination in patients with AR. On palpation of a peripheral artery, such as the radial artery, the clinician will feel rapid engorgement of the artery followed by a significant, prompt collapse of the vessel. This is due to the incompetent aortic valve failing to maintain adequate diastolic pressure in the arterial system, which also causes a widened pulse pressure. Other findings of AR include pulse synchronous head nodding (de Musset's sign) and, occasionally, a rumbling, low-pitched mid-diastolic murmur (Austin Flint murmur) that is caused by the regurgitant blood striking the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, leading to premature closure of the mitral leaflets.\nPatients with Marfan syndrome often have aortic disease (e.g., aortic regurgitation) as a consequence of cystic medial degeneration.","bool":true},{"option":"Pulsus paradoxus","explanation":"\nPulsus paradoxus is not associated with AR.

Physiologically, pulses rise simultaneously in the radial and femoral arteries. However, due to the restricted blood from through the narrowed aorta, the femoral pulse will rise later than the radial pulse. AR does not cause radio-femoral pulse delay.","bool":false},{"option":"Fixed splitting of S2","explanation":"Fixed splitting of S2 is not associated with AR; it is most commonly a result of an atrial septal defect. The second heart sound arises from the sequential closing of the aortic valve and the pulmonic valve. Inspiration increases right ventricular preload, resulting in a delay in pulmonary valve closure, which produces a physiological splitting of S2. Atrial septal defects produce a left-to-right shunt, increasing right atrial and right ventricular volume and forcing the pulmonic valve to close later regardless of breath.","bool":false},{"option":"Paradoxical splitting of S2","explanation":"\nParadoxical splitting of S2  is the pathological closure of the pulmonic valve before the aortic valve. Instead of the physiologic splitting of S2 with inspiration, S2 will instead split with expiration.

The first step in management is to determine hemodynamic status. Unstable patients require immediate treatment with transcutaneous (or transvenous) cardiac pacing. Placing a transcutaneous pacemaker is only a temporary measure until the patient is hemodynamically stable and can be further evaluated and treated for reversible causes of AV block. In patients with no reversible causes, definitive treatment includes placement of a permanent pacemaker to bypass the AV nodal block.\nIn addition to temporary cardiac pacing, prompt treatment with atropine and beta-adrenergic agents (e.g., dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine) may be indicated.

The degree of cyanosis depends on the severity of right ventricular outflow obstruction. ","answers":[{"option":"Knee-chest positioning","explanation":"\nInfants with tetralogy of Fallot frequently experience tet spells, which are thought to result from spastic contractions of the hypertrophic infundibular musculature at the transition from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. These contractions lead to severe right outflow tract obstruction, causing increased right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the VSD. Affected infants experience severe hypoxemia and profound cyanosis during tet spells and require immediate intervention. First-line treatment includes knee-chest positioning (older children can assume a squatting position) and administration of supplemental oxygen, which acts as a pulmonary vasodilator. Knee-chest positioning increases arterial oxygenation by increasing both systemic vascular resistance and left-sided heart pressures. This, in turn, decreases right-to-left shunting across the VSD and promotes blood flow into the pulmonary circulation rather than the aorta.\nTet spells that are unresponsive to oxygen administration and knee-chest positioning are managed with IV morphine for sedation and fluids for volume expansion. If those measures fail to relieve the tet spell, IV beta blockers are administered to reduce sympathetic nervous system activity and infundibular musculature spasms.","bool":true},{"option":"Lower limb elevation","explanation":"Elevation of the lower extremities increases venous return to the heart, which results in increased preload and cardiac output.

The higher the degree of RVOO, the more (unoxygenated) blood will bypass pulmonary circulation and shunt straight through the VSD to the left ventricle (LV). The lower the degree of RVOO, the more blood flows through the lungs and becomes oxygenated before reaching the LV, resulting in a reduction of cyanosis. In TOF, the single S2 can result from an attenuated pulmonary component (P2) that is often not heard on auscultation.","bool":true},{"option":"Ventricular septal defect","explanation":"A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the four features of TOF but it is not the main determinant of cyanosis.

RVH is a compensatory mechanism against the outflow tract obstruction, which helps to reduce cyanosis by increasing flow through the stenotic pulmonary vasculature, so that deoxygenated blood does not flow through the VSD and into the systemic circulation. However, RVH can only compensate to a small degree to improve normal circulatory flow and is, therefore, only a minor determinant of cyanosis.","bool":false}]},{"id":298,"info":"Cardiovascular System","question":"\nTwo days after being admitted for pneumonia, a 70-year-old man has repeated episodes of palpitations and nausea.

Along with mitral valve and papillary muscle abnormalities, septal hypertrophy can lead to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, resulting in exertional syncope and a systolic ejection murmur. Although the systolic murmur in patients with HCM does not significantly radiate into the carotid arteries, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in obstructive HCM may mimic an aortic stenosis murmur and may be heard as a subtle ejection murmur on auscultation of the carotids. The ECG shows high voltage QRS complexes, indicating left ventricular hypertrophy. HCM is most commonly a hereditary condition, which explains the history of sudden cardiac death in this patient's father.\nThe intensity of the murmur associated with HCM decreases with maneuvers that increase venous return (e.g., rapid squatting) because they increase preload, which in turn decreases the pressure gradient across the obstruction.

Assuming all other parameters remain constant, which of the following is most likely to decrease the volume of retrograde blood flow in this patient?","difficulty":2,"hint":"A holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the cardiac apex and radiates to the axilla is characteristic of mitral regurgitation (MR). The extra heart sound during diastole is most likely an S3 gallop, which is often heard in patients with moderate to severe MR.","answers":[{"option":"Decrease in systemic vascular resistance","explanation":"A decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) would reduce the volume of retrograde blood flow through the mitral valve. In mitral regurgitation (MR), the left ventricular ejection fraction is divided between the output through the aortic valve and through the abnormal regurgitant mitral valve. When SVR (left ventricular afterload) is decreased, a greater volume of blood is ejected through the aortic valve and less blood flows in a retrograde direction across the mitral valve (lower regurgitant fraction). This is the rationale for using systemic vasodilators (e.g., sodium nitroprusside) to treat dyspnea in patients with severe acute MR. Conversely, maneuvers such as isometric contraction and a hand grip, which increase SVR, reduce ejection fraction through the aortic valve and increase the retrograde flow.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure","explanation":"As retrograde flow is dependent on the pressure gradient between the LV and left atrium, an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) would increase the driving pressure and increase retrograde blood flow.","bool":false},{"option":"Increase in left ventricular inotropy","explanation":"Increased left ventricular inotropy would increase the ejection fraction and thereby decrease the left ventricular end diastolic volume. In a patient with mitral valve incompetence, as seen here, this phenomenon would be expected to decrease the regurgitant fraction (retrograde blood flow) across the mitral valve in the next cardiac cycle. However, this effect of increased LV inotropy is counteracted by the increase in left ventricular systolic pressure, which tends to increase regurgitant blood flow. Overall, increased LV inotropy does not result in a specific or predictable change in the regurgitant volume, as has been shown empirically in studies with dobutamine (an inotropic drug).","bool":false},{"option":"Decrease in left atrial systolic pressure","explanation":"The left atrial systolic pressure acts as a resistance to retrograde blood flow across the mitral valve.

Renal hypoperfusion leads to compensatory activation of RAAS in order to maintain the GFR. Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction of the afferent and efferent arterioles within the kidney, decreasing the net renal blood flow. Vasoconstriction is more pronounced in the efferent arteriole, which results in an increase in intraglomerular pressure to maintain GFR. In combination with the other effects of RAAS activation (aldosterone-induced renal Na+/H2O resorption and systemic vasoconstriction), this maintains cardiac output.\nAlthough RAAS activation is a compensatory mechanism for maintaining cardiac output in patients with CHF, prolonged renal hypoperfusion (particularly in conjunction with precipitating factors, such as NSAID use and dehydration) can lead to renal dysfunction.","bool":true},{"option":"Reduction of alveolar surface tension","explanation":"\nSurfactant ensures low alveolar surface tension to prevent alveolar collapse.

This patient, however, presents with CHF that is most likely due to chronic hypertension, as suggested by his history of poor compliance with his medication regimen.

In the heart, serotonin can cause endocardial fibrosis, resulting in carcinoid heart disease. In patients with carcinoid heart disease, the right side of the heart is typically affected as the lungs enzymatically inactivate the metabolites; therefore, the left side of the heart is usually spared.

In constrictive pericarditis, a thick, rigid, and fibrous pericardium compromises cardiac function, which is restored by the removal of the fibrotic pericardium. In patients without signs of chronic constrictive pericarditis (i.e., no pericardial calcifications, atrial fibrillation, hepatic dysfunction, anasarca, or cachexia), pharmacotherapy can be attempted first. This can include NSAIDs, colchicine, diuretics, corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory therapy; these measures should also be considered as adjuncts to pericardiectomy in chronic constrictive pericarditis.\nIn healthy individuals, the velocity of blood flow in the left side of the heart normally decreases with inspiration. However, in patients with constrictive pericarditis, this decrease in blood flow is exaggerated (&gt; 25% decrease in diastolic flow across the mitral valve) because the rigid, fibrotic, shell-like pericardium impedes diastolic filling due to impaired relaxation of the left ventricle.

This condition is strongly associated with aortic pathology, including aortic dissection (as seen in this patient), aortic valve regurgitation, aortic aneurysm, and aortic root dilation. Marfan syndrome is caused by a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene, which encodes an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that forms a supportive sheath around elastin. Defects in fibrillin-1 make elastin fibers vulnerable to fragmentation and predispose to mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation, medial fibrosis, and loss of smooth muscle cell nuclei.\nPatients with Marfan syndrome classically have marfanoid habitus, joint hypermobility, a high-arched palate, arachnodactyly, skin hyperelasticity, and superotemporal lens subluxation.","bool":true},{"option":"Condylomata lata","explanation":"\nCondylomata lata are characteristic of secondary syphilis, not Marfan syndrome.

The aortic valve is the second most common valve affected by rheumatic heart disease. Both aortic regurgitation (AR) and aortic stenosis (AS) can cause left heart failure, resulting in symptoms like those seen here.

Chronic HTN causes long-term concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle and, if left untreated, can ultimately result in left-sided heart failure, which manifests with symptoms of pulmonary congestion (e.g., exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, bibasilar crackles), tachycardia, and S4 heart sound. Long-term left-sided heart failure may eventually progress to right-sided heart failure as a result of chronic volume overload and manifest with symptoms of fluid retention (e.g., peripheral edema, jugular venous distention). Although this patient's blood pressure is only mildly elevated, it is most likely attributed to the backflow of blood into the right chambers of the heart and a consequent decrease in left ventricular output.","bool":true},{"option":"Recent use of simvastatin","explanation":"\nSimvastatin does not exacerbate CHF.

In patients with this condition, an early-diastolic heart sound (S3) can be heard due to a sudden rush of blood into the volume-overloaded ventricles. While concurrent alcoholic cardiomyopathy cannot be completely excluded in this patient, the echocardiographic finding of concentric hypertrophy and S4 heart sound make another underlying cause more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Pericardial effusion","explanation":"Severe pericardial effusion (cardiac tamponade) can present with Beck triad of jugular venous distention, hypotension, and muffled (distant) heart sounds.

In developed countries, it is the most common cause of mitral valve degeneration and subsequent mitral valve prolapse. As the disease course progresses, mitral regurgitation can occur. This patient presents with common features of mitral valve prolapse (palpitations, anxiety, chest pain, mid-systolic click). The new-onset dyspnea, holosystolic murmur, and crackles on lung auscultation are consistent with regurgitation of the mitral valve, indicating an advanced disease process.","bool":true},{"option":"Inflammatory valve degeneration","explanation":"Inflammatory valve degeneration occurs in rheumatic heart disease, a late sequela of group A streptococcal infection, which often affects the mitral valve. Earlier stages of rheumatic heart disease most often involve mitral valve regurgitation, which then later develops into mitral stenosis.

VSDs are associated with frequent respiratory infections secondary to congestion of the pulmonary vessels.","answers":[{"option":"Digital clubbing","explanation":"\nDigital clubbing is a sign of chronic hypoxemia, which is a complication of an untreated VSD. VSDs are acyanotic congenital heart defects that manifest as a left-to-right shunt. An untreated VSD can lead to chronic volume overload of the right ventricle (RV) and subsequently increased blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature. This increased flow causes irreversible remodeling of the small pulmonary vessels, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and RV hypertrophy. RV pressure increases until it exceeds left ventricular (LV) pressure, at which point the shunt is reversed. This shunt reversal is known as Eisenmenger syndrome. Cyanosis and consequently, chronic tissue hypoxia, leads to the development of digital clubbing.\nChronic tissue hypoxia and megakaryocyte fragmentation are primary factors involved in the pathogenesis of digital clubbing. In Eisenmenger syndrome, blood can completely bypass the pulmonary vasculature, allowing whole megakaryocytes into the systemic circulation. Once these intact cells reach distal capillaries in the hands and feet, they impact and subsequently fragment. This fragmentation causes the release of platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, inducing angiogenesis and local mesenchymal growth and proliferation, which clinically manifests as digital clubbing.","bool":true},{"option":"Secondary hypertension","explanation":"\nSecondary hypertension can result from congenital heart defects such as coarctation of the aorta.

This patient most likely has cardiac tamponade as a complication of acute pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade can occur if increased amounts of inflammatory fluid are secreted into the pericardial space, compressing the cardiac chambers.

This diagnosis is further supported by her friction rub (triphasic scratching sound) and ECG showing diffuse ST segment elevation. Pericardial involvement is a common adverse effect of radiation therapy of the chest. In the acute setting, exposure to high doses of radiation causes cellular injury, which leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, resulting in neutrophilic infiltration of the pericardium.\nSeveral years after radiation therapy, individuals may develop constrictive pericarditis, which is characterized by fibrotic thickening of the pericardium and manifests with symptoms of fluid overload.

A pericardial knock is often heard on auscultation in constrictive pericarditis due to the abrupt halting of diastolic ventricular relaxation and filling by the rigid pericardial sac. In constrictive pericarditis, reduced ventricular filling leads to manifestations of reduced cardiac output (forward failure), such as fatigue and/or dyspnea, as well as those of fluid overload (backward failure), such as jugular venous distention, positive Kussmaul sign, hepatomegaly, and the clinical features seen in this patient.\nWhile tuberculosis is the most likely underlying cause of constrictive pericarditis in this patient, other etiologies include prior cardiac surgery, radiation therapy to the chest, viral infection, and connective tissue diseases.","bool":true},{"option":"Fixed split second heart sound","explanation":"Fixed splitting of S2 is pathognomonic for atrial septal defect. Although patients with constrictive pericarditis may occasionally have wide splitting of S2 during inspiration due to a reduction in the left ventricular ejection time, they do not have fixed splitting of S2.","bool":false},{"option":"Absent jugular venous pulse y descent","explanation":"The y descent of the jugular venous pulse waveform corresponds to the emptying of the right atrium following the opening of the tricuspid valve. Absent y descent would indicate resistance to all phases of diastolic filling, which is seen in cardiac tamponade. In constrictive pericarditis, the early phase of diastolic filling is unchanged, but the mid-late phase is met with resistance. This, coupled with the high jugular venous distention of chronic venous congestion, produces a prominent y descent that is accentuated in the early phase as filling drops rapidly from a higher peak pressure.","bool":false},{"option":"Fourth heart sound","explanation":"A fourth heart sound (S4) is caused by a late diastolic contraction of the atria and is seen in restrictive cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ischemic heart disease. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is an important differential diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis because it can manifest similarly. However, it does not cause calcification of the cardiac silhouette. An S4 is not a physical exam finding of constrictive pericarditis, most likely because the rigid pericardial sac impairs atrial contraction.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Friction rub","explanation":"In acute pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardial layers can cause friction as they move during the cardiac cycle, creating an audible friction rub on cardiac auscultation.

This increased blood flow causes pulmonary hypertension and irreversible remodeling of small pulmonary vessels, which may eventually lead to an Eisenmenger reaction (shunt reversal). This patient's palpable right parasternal heave and pronounced S2 are evidence of increased right heart strain. In patients with a large PDA, the features of differential cyanosis occur once shunt reversal develops. Because the ductus is located on the descending aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, reversal of the shunt results in deoxygenated blood reaching only the lower body. Due to the rise in pulmonary pressure, the characteristic continuous machine-like murmur heard in patients with PDA eventually disappears.","bool":true},{"option":"Abnormal narrowing of the aorta at the aortic isthmus","explanation":"Abnormal narrowing at the aortic isthmus is consistent with coarctation of the aorta (CoA), which would cause differential cyanosis if the CoA is severe (i.e., a ductal-dependent congenital heart defect) but this differential cyanosis would be evident from the neonatal period. In addition, patients with CoA have a brachio-femoral pulse delay rather than synchronous pulses. The symptoms of a mild CoA can begin later in life but in such a scenario, differential cyanosis would not be expected. Instead, patients present with features of brachiocephalic hypertension (e.g., headaches, epistaxis), lower extremity arterial insufficiency (manifesting with claudication and cool skin with faint or unpalpable pulses, but no cyanosis), and evidence of compensatory collateral arteries (e.g., continuous murmur over the back).","bool":false},{"option":"Positioning of the ascending aorta directly over a ventricular septal defect","explanation":"Positioning of the ascending aorta directly over a ventricular septal defect is seen in tetralogy of Fallot.

A patient with advanced CVD, as seen here, or a correctable cause of venous reflux should undergo endovenous thermal ablation as long as there are no contraindications to the procedure (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, peripheral artery disease). All patients with CVD should be counseled on lifestyle changes to improve venous return (e.g., daily exercise, frequent elevation of the legs, avoidance of long periods of standing and sitting).","bool":true},{"option":"Clopidogrel and cilostazol therapy","explanation":"Antiplatelet (e.g., clopidogrel) or vasodilator (e.g., cilostazol) therapy is not effective in the management of CVD. These drugs are primarily used in the management of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which can cause lower limb ulcers but such ulcers typically have regular margins and a punched-out appearance and occur over pressure points (e.g., tips of toes, lateral malleolus). Furthermore, PAD causes pale, shiny, cold, hairless skin on the lower extremities rather than edema and dermatitis and the normal ankle-brachial index (1.0–1.4) makes PAD extremely unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Contrast venography","explanation":"For patients with CVD, studies such as venography or venous plethysmography are not routinely recommended. These studies are only considered if the initial imaging modality is inconclusive or in specific circumstances (e.g., surgical planning for CVD due to intraabdominal venous obstruction).","bool":false},{"option":"Sclerotherapy","explanation":"\nSclerotherapy, which is a form of vein ablation therapy (VAT), is a treatment option for varicose veins.

This procedure is minimally invasive, and studies suggest similar efficacy to open surgical treatment. Reassuring vital signs and benign abdominal examination findings in this patient suggest acute bowel ischemia without permanent infarction, which is likely to resolve with the restoration of blood flow. This patient should also receive supportive measures (e.g., intravenous fluids, nasogastric decompression, broad-spectrum antibiotics) as well as anticoagulation, preferably with unfractionated heparin.","bool":true},{"option":"Explorative laparotomy","explanation":"\nExplorative laparotomy is reserved for acutely ill patients who are at risk for rapid deterioration, including patients with acute mesenteric ischemia who are hemodynamically unstable or have evidence of peritonitis (rebound tenderness and involuntary guarding). Because this patient has stable vital signs and a benign abdominal exam, explorative laparotomy is not the preferred treatment at this time.","bool":false},{"option":"Anticoagulation with warfarin","explanation":"Anticoagulation with warfarin should be considered in all patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), as AF increases the risk of thromboembolic complications, especially if rhythm control is unsuccessful. However, anticoagulation with warfarin requires bridging therapy with heparin because of the initial risk of warfarin-associated hypercoagulation. In addition, warfarin therapy is a long-term measure to treat underlying AF but is not indicated in the management of acute mesenteric ischemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Colonoscopy","explanation":"Although colonoscopy is used to diagnose large bowel pathologies (e.g., lower gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulosis, colon cancer), it is not indicated for patients with acute mesenteric ischemia. Poor patient preparation will likely lead to poor visualization of the colon, and the diseased bowel is more prone to perforation when insufflating while advancing the scope.","bool":false},{"option":"Cefazolin therapy","explanation":"\nCefazolin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that is commonly used perioperatively to prevent surgical site infection.

Now, she presents with clinical features of a left-sided stroke (e.g., right-sided weakness, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski), which in a young patient with signs of DVT (swollen, tender, erythematous left leg) should raise concern for paradoxical embolism.","answers":[{"option":"Patent foramen ovale","explanation":"\nParadoxical emboli can pass through any right-to-left shunt, but a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is the most common route. A PFO is considered an abnormal anatomical variant of the heart and is present in ∼ 25% of the general population. In addition to a stroke workup (i.e., noncontrast head CT, possible thrombolysis, etc.), this patient should also undergo compression ultrasonography to confirm DVT. Because of the risk of pulmonary embolism and recurrent cerebral emboli, this patient should be started on anticoagulant therapy once cerebral hemorrhage is ruled out and undergo echocardiography to evaluate for surgical closure of the PFO.","bool":true},{"option":"Atrial fibrillation","explanation":"\nAtrial fibrillation is a very common cause of thromboembolic stroke in older adults and those with heart disease (e.g., heart failure). This patient is at low risk for atrial fibrillation because of her age and lack of heart disease. Also, her heart rhythm was normal on examination, which decreases the likelihood of atrial fibrillation (but does not rule it out).","bool":false},{"option":"Ventricular septal defect","explanation":"\nVentricular septal defects are the most common pediatric septal defect and can cause paradoxical embolism, which has likely occurred in this patient.

Most patients with primary cardiac tumors do not initially present with stroke, but experience symptoms of heart failure (e.g., dyspnea, edema) due to the tumor obstructing blood flow. Additionally, patients often experience constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss). While this patient has stroke and fever, she lacks signs of heart failure. Her unilateral leg abnormalities are more suggestive of DVT.","bool":false},{"option":"Carotid artery dissection","explanation":"\nCarotid dissection can occur at any age and is a common cause of stroke in young patients (∼ 20% of cases). Cervical artery dissection classically presents with headache and neck pain following exertion (e.g., exercise, sexual intercourse, or even sneezing). This patient's lack of headache or neck pain in the presence of symptoms suggesting DVT make another etiology more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Mitral valve vegetation","explanation":"Embolism of septic vegetations from infective endocarditis (IE) that go to the brain can cause stroke. Patients with IE can also present with fever and tachycardia. However, IE is unlikely in patients without major risk factors for the disease (e.g., recent dental procedure, IV drug abuse, active untreated bacterial infection).

An S4 gallop is almost always pathological.","answers":[{"option":"Decreased compliance of the left ventricle","explanation":"\nDecreased compliance of the left ventricle is most likely due to left ventricular hypertrophy caused by long-standing hypertension and often manifests with an S4 gallop. Increased blood pressure activates angiotensin II either by local mechanical stretching of myocardiocytes or as a result of the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II promotes concentric remodeling of the heart, increasing stiffness of the organ, thus, decreasing compliance.","bool":true},{"option":"Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve","explanation":"\nMyxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve occurs in some connective tissue diseases (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome) leading to eventual mitral valve prolapse (MVP). MVP is associated with late-systolic crescendo murmurs as blood backflows from the left ventricle to the left atrium, preceded by a midsystolic click due to tensing of the chordae tendinae. The mitral regurgitation and volume overload associated with MVP can also result in an S3, which is an early diastolic sound, but MVP is not typically associated with an S4, as seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Dilation of the aortic root","explanation":"Dilation of the aortic root, which is caused by age-related degenerative changes, hypertension, aortitis (e.g., tertiary syphilis), or connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan syndrome), causes chronic aortic insufficiency (AI). AI can result in a low-pitched, mid or late diastolic sound that is best heard at the cardiac apex due to vibration of the ventricular wall by the regurgitant jet. However, a patient with AI would also have an early diastolic murmur best heard in the right upper sternal border. An isolated low-pitched, late diastolic sound on cardiac examination suggests another cause.","bool":false},{"option":"Thickening of the mitral valve leaflets","explanation":"Thickening of the mitral leaflet is seen in mitral stenosis and is the cause of the opening snap, which is an early diastolic sound that is best heard at the apex in the left lateral decubitus position.

The sound that is heard here is an S4 gallop, which is an unusual finding in pericarditis.

However, patients with right heart failure and cardiogenic shock also present with jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status, none of which are seen here.","bool":false}]},{"id":432,"info":"Cardiovascular System","question":"\nA 2-week-old newborn is brought to the physician because of worsening feeding difficulty since birth.

Successful repair of this defect will restore normal cardiac output.\n\n","answers":[{"option":"B","explanation":"A VSD causes left-to-right shunting of blood because the left ventricular pressure is physiologically higher than the right ventricular pressure due to the thicker ventricular wall and higher force of contraction. Closure of a VSD would, therefore, increase the amount of blood in the left ventricle and decrease the amount of blood in the right ventricle during each cardiac cycle. This results in an increase in left ventricular pressure and a decrease in right ventricular pressure as well as right ventricular output, which translates to a decrease in the amount of blood flowing into the left atrium and therefore a decrease in left atrial pressure.","bool":true},{"option":"A","explanation":"\nMitral stenosis (MS) causes a left atrial outflow obstruction. The left atrium has to contract against the partially closed mitral valve, which results in an increased left atrial pressure. Once repaired, left atrial outflow increases, thereby decreasing the left atrial pressure. The left ventricular input increases, thereby increasing the left ventricular pressure. The right ventricular pressure remains unchanged. These hemodynamic changes would not, however, be expected after the closure of a VSD.","bool":false},{"option":"E","explanation":"Both atrial septal defect repair, which stops shunting of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium, and pulmonary stenosis repair, which removes the right ventricular outflow obstruction, would decrease right ventricular pressure and increase left atrial as well as left ventricular pressure by increasing the amount of blood in the left side of the heart. These hemodynamic changes would not, however, be expected after the closure of a VSD.","bool":false},{"option":"C","explanation":"An increase in the pressure of all the chambers of the heart would be expected following fluid resuscitation in patients with hypovolemic shock. These hemodynamic changes would not be expected after the closure of a VSD.","bool":false},{"option":"D","explanation":"A decrease in the pressure in all the chambers of the heart would be expected following pericardiotomy for constrictive pericarditis or following aspiration of a hemopericardium.

He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years. His blood pressure is 145/80 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows generalized tenderness and a pulsatile mass in the periumbilical region on deep palpation. Further evaluation of the affected blood vessel is most likely to show which of the following?","difficulty":4,"hint":"The presence of chronic dull abdominal pain and a pulsatile abdominal mass suggests an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).","answers":[{"option":"Accumulation of foam cells in the tunica intima","explanation":"Accumulation of foam cells in the tunica intima is the pathological process underlying atheroma formation (atherosclerosis), which is the most common cause of aortic wall weakening and formation of an AAA. This patient's history of smoking, hypertension, and advanced age are all risk factors for atherosclerosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Fragmentation of elastic tissue in the tunica media","explanation":"Fragmentation of elastic tissue in the tunica media is the pathological process underlying cystic medial necrosis (CMN), which occurs in certain connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome. However, for reasons that are not completely understood, CMN typically affects the thoracic aorta rather than the abdominal aorta. A different pathological process is the most common cause of an AAA. Furthermore, this patient does not have features of Marfan syndrome (e.g., tall stature, long extremities, joint hypermobility, ectopia lentis).","bool":false},{"option":"Formation of giant cells in the tunica media","explanation":"Formation of giant cells in the tunica media is characteristic of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis, both of which are large vessel vasculitides and can result in an AAA. However, neither condition is the most common cause of AAA, and this patient does not report any symptoms that would otherwise suggest an increased likelihood of GCA (e.g., headache, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication) or Takayasu arteritis (e.g., limb claudication or onset of symptoms before the age of 40 years), so a different pathological process is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Obliterative inflammation of the vasa vasorum","explanation":"Obliterative inflammation of the vasa vasorum is characteristic of syphilitic aortitis, which can result in an aortic aneurysm. However, syphilitic aortitis affects the ascending aorta, whereas this patient presents with a mass in the abdominal portion of the descending aorta.","bool":false},{"option":"Necrotizing inflammation of the entire vessel wall","explanation":"\nNecrotizing inflammation of all the layers of the vessel wall is characteristic of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), which can cause microaneurysms in medium-sized arteries (e.g., mesenteric arteries and renal arteries), episodic abdominal pain (due to mesenteric ischemia), and hypertension (due to renal involvement). However, PAN would not cause a pulsatile periumbilical mass because it spares large arteries like the aorta. Other clinical features of vasculitis, such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and cutaneous lesions (e.g., livedo reticularis, distal ulcerations), would be expected instead.","bool":false}]}]
