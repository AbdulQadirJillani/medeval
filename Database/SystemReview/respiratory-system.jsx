Intubation and mechanical ventilation are the priority in all patients with CDH and should be performed before any further intervention because they help to decrease air swallowing and correct hypoxia. Bag-mask ventilation is contraindicated as air is pumped into the stomach and the bowel, resulting in gastric and/or intestinal distention and further compression of the lung. As in this patient, the majority (approximately 85%) of CDH cases are left-sided.\nFollowing intubation, a nasogastric tube should be placed for gastric decompression to decompress the stomach/bowel and reduce lung compression.","bool":true},{"option":"Surgical repair","explanation":"Surgical repair is indicated in all cases of CDH since spontaneous closure is unlikely and surgery may prevent further complications of the lung (e.g., pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension) and intestine (e.g., bowel obstruction, strangulation, or perforation). The most common procedure is the reduction of the hernial contents followed by closure (primary or using a biomaterial patch) of the diaphragmatic defect. However, surgery should be deferred until the newborn has been stabilized (most frequently at 24–48 hours); therefore, it is not the most appropriate next step in a patient with acute respiratory decompensation.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Chest tube placement","explanation":"The patient has some of the characteristic features of tension pneumothorax, including respiratory distress, absent breath sounds over the affected side of the lung, and shifting of heart sounds to the contralateral side, suggesting mediastinal deviation. However, in addition to the mediastinal shift to the right, this patient's chest x-ray shows findings of CDH. While chest tube placement is the preferred and often life-saving treatment for pneumothorax, it is contraindicated in patients with a diaphragmatic hernia as there is a high risk of injury to the herniated bowel.","bool":false},{"option":"Surfactant administration","explanation":"Endotracheal surfactant is indicated in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). Neonates with NRDS may present with tachypnea and cyanosis, however, this patient's chest x-ray indicates CDH.

Trauma to the chest can cause the ribs to pierce the pleura and damage intrathoracic vessels, which can lead to accumulation of blood in the pleural space. There is tracheal deviation to the opposite side due to the increasing volume in the pleural space. A hemothorax cannot be diagnosed with x-ray alone (diagnosis usually requires CT imaging or thoracentesis) but given the patient's recent trauma, this is the most likely etiology.","bool":true},{"option":"Bacteria in the pulmonary parenchyma","explanation":"\nBacteria in the pulmonary parenchyma (e.g., due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) would be consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Expected chest x-ray findings in bacterial pneumonia would also include a lobar opacity, but tracheal deviation and an air-fluid level, as seen here, would be unusual. Furthermore, this patient does not have fever or symptoms of pneumonia, making this unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Neoplastic cells in the bronchi","explanation":"\nNeoplastic cells in the bronchi would be consistent with lung cancer, which this patient has risk factors for (smoking, age). An obstructive lung cancer could also cause tracheal deviation but would cause tracheal deviation towards the affected side, due to lung collapse, unlike what is seen here. This patient's large left-sided pleural effusion in the setting of recent fall make a different diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Air between the pleura and chest wall","explanation":"Trapped air between the pleura and chest wall is the underlying pathophysiology of pneumothorax. Given this patient's history of progressively worsening left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath, pneumothorax should be considered as a possible diagnosis. A tension pneumothorax can cause tracheal deviation away from the affected side, due to increased intrathoracic pressure. However, x-ray findings in pneumothorax would include absent lung markings and areas of increased radiolucency rather than the large opacity and air-fluid level seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Fluid in alveoli","explanation":"Symptoms of pulmonary edema may include dyspnea and low oxygen saturation due to impaired oxygenation. While both are seen in this patient, pulmonary edema alone would not cause such a pronounced air-fluid level on x-ray.

After the patient has been stabilized, bronchoscopy is indicated to identify the source of bleeding as well as to stop the bleeding (e.g., via balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, topical epinephrine, or laser therapy). If bleeding cannot be controlled by bronchoscopy, arteriography with embolization or surgery should be attempted. In patients with signs of coagulopathy, or those taking anticoagulants, transfusion of blood products or administration of reversal agents may be warranted.\nIn a patient with a significant smoking history, an x-ray finding of a pulmonary nodule in combination with pulmonary symptoms (progressive shortness of breath and cough productive of blood-tinged sputum) suggests pulmonary hemorrhage due to bronchogenic carcinoma.","bool":true},{"option":"CT scan of the chest","explanation":"\nCT scan of the chest is indicated in patients with a new lesion detected on chest x-ray.

This measure provides respiratory support, prevents exhaustion, and serves as a bridge to endotracheal intubation. This patient has clinical features of acute respiratory distress (e.g., tachypnea, inspiratory stridor, accessory muscle breathing, low oxygen saturation); therefore, immediate bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen is warranted. A practitioner experienced in difficult airway management should perform emergency endotracheal intubation in a controlled setting under direct visualization (using a video-assisted laryngoscopy, if available) to further secure the patient's airway.\nSince the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, epiglottitis no longer mainly manifests as a life-threatening illness in children and is now predominantly seen in adults, particularly those with a BMI &gt; 25, a history of diabetes mellitus, coexistent pneumonia, or a preceding upper respiratory infection.","bool":true},{"option":"X-ray of the lateral neck","explanation":"An x-ray of the lateral neck can be obtained in a stable patient to confirm the diagnosis of epiglottitis, which can manifest as a thumbprint sign due to supraglottic narrowing.

In adult patients with acute epiglottitis, however, only one attempt at endotracheal intubation should be made before an emergency cricothyroidotomy is performed at the bedside. Patients with epiglottitis can develop worsening respiratory distress despite appropriate bag-mask ventilation, and they are predisposed to rapid progression to complete airway obstruction following any manipulation of the epiglottis. Therefore, as soon as epiglottitis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the management of difficult airways (e.g., anesthesiologist or otolaryngologist) should be notified and an intubation kit that includes the most advanced difficult airway adjuncts available (e.g., video laryngoscope, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope) should be obtained.\nIn children under 12 years of age with epiglottitis, needle cricothyroidotomy is preferred because of the funnel shape and narrowness of the trachea at the height of the cricoid ring as opposed to adults, in whom the trachea is narrowest at the level of the vocal cords.\n\n","bool":true},{"option":"Perform tracheostomy","explanation":"\nTracheostomy is a complex procedure that is customarily performed as a planned procedure in the operating room.

While HPV-negative oropharynx tumors are associated with dietary nitrosamine, alcohol consumption, and smoking, HPV-positive SCC is associated with the sexual transmission of high-risk HPV subtypes (e.g., types 16 and 18). These HPV subtypes produce the E7 protein, which inhibits retinoblastoma protein and consequently promotes increased cell proliferation.

Obesity is a risk factor for another common comorbidity associated with asthma.","answers":[{"option":"Add a proton pump inhibitor","explanation":"This patient's persistent cough and substernal chest pain are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for which obesity is a risk factor. GERD is a known trigger of asthma and is associated with difficult-to-treat disease. It is thought to worsen asthma as a result of chronic microaspiration of stomach contents into the upper airways as well as an increase in vagal tone. Asthma that worsens when lying down or after meals should raise concern for GERD-induced disease. Since this patient has only had a partial response to her recently initiated asthma medication, a trial of empiric therapy with a proton pump inhibitor is the most appropriate next step in management.","bool":true},{"option":"Add a salmeterol inhaler","explanation":"\nSalmeterol is a long-acting beta agonist that is used in the management of moderate chronic asthma. Salmeterol would be a reasonable next step in the escalation of her asthma therapy because this patient currently uses a short-acting beta agonist and a corticosteroid inhaler. However, other comorbidities that potentially worsen asthma should be treated before escalating asthma therapy.","bool":false},{"option":"Add oral prednisone","explanation":"Oral prednisone is used to treat acute asthma exacerbations or severe, therapy-refractory chronic asthma. This patient does not present with acute dyspnea and wheezing, which makes an acute asthma exacerbation unlikely. In addition, her FEV1  of 78% of predicted indicates moderate asthma severity, which does not warrant an oral corticosteroid therapy.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform methacholine challenge test","explanation":"The methacholine challenge test is used in suspected asthma when pulmonary function tests are inconclusive. This test has a high negative predictive value and is particularly useful for ruling out asthma as a potential diagnosis.

This patient's recurring chest pain, exertional dyspnea, and cough exacerbation when lying supine are possible symptoms of heart failure and lung edema. In some cases, severe mitral valve stenosis may lead to hoarseness due to recurrent laryngeal nerve damage by an enlarged left atrium. However, further signs and symptoms of heart failure such as peripheral pitting edema, increased jugular venous distention, nocturia, and tachycardia would be expected at this point.

This patient most likely developed a parapneumonic effusion, a type of exudate.","answers":[{"option":"Increased pleural vascular permeability","explanation":"\nParapneumonic pleural effusions are typically exudative. Pneumonia is associated with pleural inflammation, which leads to increased pleural vascular permeability, causing capillary leakage of exudate. Although exudative and transudative pleural effusions are usually differentiated by Light's criteria, a pleural fluid pH of &lt; 7.3 - 7.45 also suggests an exudative rather than transudative effusion, which typically has a pH of 7.45–7.55. In exudative pleural effusions, the anaerobic metabolic activity of both bacteria and leukocytes accumulating in the pleural fluid transforms glucose into lactate, which leads to a decrease in pleural fluid pH. Early antibiotic treatment is indicated to prevent progression to complicated effusion and empyema. See “Adjunctive pleural fluid analysis” table.\nComplicated parapneumonic effusions, defined by pleural fluid pH &lt; 7.2, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and/or glucose &lt; 60 mg/dL, are an indication for chest tube placement because this type of effusion is less likely to resolve spontaneously.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased plasma oncotic pressure","explanation":"Decreased plasma oncotic pressure is the underlying pathomechanism of pleural effusions in cirrhosis and/or nephrotic syndrome. Both conditions lead to reduced serum concentrations of albumin, the main serum protein that maintains intravascular oncotic pressure. Consequently, fluid extravasates into the interstitial space, resulting in a transudative effusion with a pH of 7.45–7.55. This patient's pleural effusion has a pH of 7.3. Although this patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, he does not present with symptoms of either condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased pulmonary capillary pressure","explanation":"Increased pulmonary capillary pressure is the underlying mechanism of pleural effusions in individuals with left heart failure. The inability of the heart to pump blood forward causes a backup of blood into the left atrium and the pulmonary veins. This backup increases the hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vasculature (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), leading to pulmonary edema and transudative pleural effusions. Transudative effusions typically have a pH of 7.45–7.55, whereas this patient's effusion has a pH of 7.3. Moreover, signs and symptoms of left-sided heart failure would be expected bilaterally, unlike the unilateral parapneumonic effusion seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Impaired pulmonary lymphatic flow","explanation":"Impaired lymphatic flow results in chylothorax, an exudative effusion. Chylothorax is commonly caused by thoracic duct obstruction due to malignancy (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer) or thoracic duct injury (e.g., due to thoracic surgery or severe trauma). Although this patient's history of smoking increases his risk of lung cancer, he lacks systemic features of malignancy such as weight loss. Moreover, he has no history of recent trauma or surgery.","bool":false},{"option":"Intrapleural accumulation of blood","explanation":"Intrapleural accumulation of blood is usually only seen in severe types of pneumonia, such as necrotizing pneumonia, which manifests with severe sepsis and hemoptysis. This patient has a nonbloody and uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion, as suggested by the pH of 7.3. Nontraumatic hemothorax most commonly results from spontaneous pneumothorax (due to the shearing of adhesions between the parietal and visceral pleura), vascular disease (e.g., ruptured aortic aneurysm, intrathoracic arterial dissection), or malignancy (spontaneous tumor bleeding). COPD may be complicated by pneumothorax, and his smoking history increases his risk for lung cancer. However, the chest x-ray shows no signs of either condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Transdiaphragmatic fluid movement","explanation":"Transdiaphragmatic fluid movement causes hepatic hydrothorax, a pulmonary complication of cirrhosis that is most commonly right-sided and manifests with dyspnea. Although this patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, he has no signs of ascites (e.g., abdominal distention), which would be expected in this condition. Moreover, hepatic hydrothorax is a transudative effusion, which usually has a pH of 7.45–7.55.

After intubation, an orogastric tube should be placed to relieve gastric distention caused by water that may have entered passively during submersion. Continuous ECG monitoring is necessary to assess for arrhythmias. Finally, wet clothes must be removed and the patient rewarmed.\nFor asymptomatic patients, continuous observation is required as submersion injuries can manifest with a delayed onset of symptoms.

The destruction of the elastic fibers causes a decrease in lung elasticity and an increase in lung compliance. The loss of elastic supporting tissue around the distal terminal bronchioli and respiratory units leads to premature closure of the small airways during expiration, which causes air trapping distal to the collapsed bronchioli and, subsequently, emphysema. Chronic hyperinflation (indicated by the increased TLC) due to loss of collapsing pressure of the lungs results in diaphragmatic flattening, which impairs this muscle's normal function: expansion of the thoracic cavity and subsequent airflow into the lungs during inspiration. Consequently, the use of accessory respiratory muscles becomes necessary, resulting in labored breathing and dyspnea.\nOther respiratory changes associated with COPD are related to chronic bronchitis, e.g., ciliary dysfunction and mucous airway obstruction. Patients with chronic bronchitis predominant COPD typically present with a history of chronic productive cough and cyanosis and experience early hypoxia (because of a V/Q mismatch resulting from airway obliteration due to excessive mucus production) and late dyspnea (because FVC is less affected by bronchitis than emphysema). Patients with COPD commonly have aspects of both chronic bronchitis and emphysema.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased alveolar elasticity","explanation":"In COPD, chronic bronchopulmonary inflammation results in increased amounts of local neutrophils and macrophages, both of which release elastases and free radicals that destroy bronchoalveolar elastic fibers.

Further, airway obstruction (due to retained pulmonary secretions) leads to resorption of gas by pulmonary capillaries, which can cause the collapse of nonventilated alveoli distal to the bronchial occlusion (i.e., resorptive atelectasis). However, increased positive pressure can reopen the collapsed alveoli by stenting open the airways, providing the lung expansion that the patient is unable to achieve by themself.

This patient's cough has persisted despite treatment with an antihistamine (diphenhydramine), making UACS unlikely. Since he has no symptoms suggestive of GERD (e.g., retrosternal burning pain, regurgitation), cough-variant asthma is the most likely diagnosis. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) is the first-line diagnostic step in patients with suspected obstructive lung disease. Spirometry showing an obstructive lung pattern (↓ FEV1, ↓ FEV1/FVC ratio) that reverses with bronchodilation (postbronchodilator test) confirms the diagnosis of asthma.

Absent or decreased breath sounds on the left suggest inadvertent right mainstem bronchus intubation, which is more common than inadvertent left mainstem bronchus intubation because the right mainstem bronchus is more vertically oriented than the left mainstem bronchus at the bifurcation of the trachea. When this is suspected, the appropriate next step is to pull back the ETT to the correct placement in the trachea, approx. 2–6 cm above the carina (or at the level of the T2–T4 vertebra on a chest x-ray). Methods of confirming the correct placement of an ETT include chest x-ray, end tidal CO2 measurement via capnography, and epigastric auscultation (gurgling suggests that ETT is in the GI tract).","bool":true},{"option":"Insert a needle into the second intercostal space","explanation":"\nNeedle decompression is used in the emergent management of tension pneumothorax, a potentially life-threatening condition that can rapidly lead to hemodynamic collapse from elevated intrathoracic pressures (by causing a drop in venous return and cardiac preload).

Predominantly caused by non-small cell lung cancer, these tumors are located in the superior sulcus of the lung, where infiltration of nearby structures causes a recognizable constellation of symptoms. This patient's unilateral facial swelling and head fullness are likely due to jugular venous congestion, while his unilateral arm edema suggests subclavian venous congestion. These vessels merge at the brachiocephalic vein, making it the most likely site of obstruction.\nPancoast tumors can also cause SVC syndrome and Horner syndrome.","bool":true},{"option":"Mediastinal lymphoma","explanation":"\nMediastinal lymphoma, most often Hodgkin lymphoma or primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, manifests with signs and symptoms of a mediastinal mass (e.g., chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath), B symptoms, and cervical lymphadenopathy, none of which are present here. Mediastinal lymphoma is most likely to occur in the anterior mediastinum, causing compression of the superior vena cava (i.e., SVC syndrome). Since the SVC drains both the right and left brachiocephalic veins, SVC syndrome involves bilateral symptoms, unlike the unilateral symptoms seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Right heart failure","explanation":"\nRight heart failure causes backward failure, leading to systemic venous congestion, increased central venous pressure, jugular venous distension (JVD), and peripheral pitting edema. Although this patient does have JVD and edema, the edema caused by right heart failure would be bilateral, because the right heart receives venous blood from both sides of the body via the superior vena cava.

Gunshot wounds commonly injure the small bowel, colon, and liver, and a FAST exam cannot rule out all sources of abdominal bleeding. During expiration, the dome of the diaphragm may reach as high as the fourth intercostal space on the right and the fifth intercostal space on the left. For this reason, any penetrating injury below this level is treated as if it involves both the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Although this patient may also have a diaphragmatic and/or pulmonary injury, as indicated by the right lower lobe opacity seen on chest x-ray, this is unlikely to be responsible for his hypotension and tachycardia. Given the site of injury and equivocal FAST exam, an exploratory laparotomy is indicated to assess for potential intraabdominal injuries that may be the cause of his hemodynamic instability.\nOther indications for emergency laparotomy include evisceration, signs of peritonitis (abdominal pain with guarding/rebound tenderness), and free air under the diaphragm.","bool":true},{"option":"CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis","explanation":"\nCT scan is used to assess patients with penetrating abdominal wounds if they are stable on examination.

This patient exhibits all the signs and symptoms of a massive hemothorax, i.e., tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, flat neck veins, decreased breath sounds, and dullness on percussion on the affected side, as well as tracheal deviation to the opposite side. A hemothorax, however small, must always be drained because blood in the pleural cavity may clot if not evacuated, resulting in a trapped lung (impaired lung expansion due to the clot) or an empyema (due to clot infection). Treatment usually consists of chest tube insertion into the 4th–5th intercostal space at the midaxillary line in order to allow the blood to drain away and improve lung ventilation.","bool":true},{"option":"Tension pneumothorax","explanation":"\nTension pneumothorax may manifest with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, decreased breath sounds on the affected side, and deviation of the trachea to the opposite side. However, neck veins would be distended instead of collapsed because the mediastinal shift that occurs with a tension pneumothorax compresses the superior vena cava. Also, lung fields on the affected side would be hyperresonant instead of dull on percussion.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Cardiac tamponade","explanation":"\nCardiac tamponade may manifest with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.

This infant has classic features of BPD, which include new-onset respiratory distress, cyanosis due to hypoxemia, and chest x-ray findings such as granular densities and hyperinflation interspersed with areas of atelectasis. Treatment of BPD is primarily focused on limiting oxygen toxicity and preventing complications (e.g., pneumothorax, cardiovascular collapse, neonatal sepsis).","bool":true},{"option":"Bronchiolitis obliterans","explanation":"\nBronchiolitis obliterans (BO) can manifest with features of respiratory distress (e.g., intercostal retractions, tachypnea, cyanosis), nonspecific auscultatory findings including wheezing and crackles, and hyperinflation on chest x-ray due to air-trapping, which are seen here. However, pediatric BO typically occurs following a severe lung infection, especially adenovirus pneumonia, and the clinical features of BO develop over years with a waxing and waning course. BO would be unlikely in this infant with no history of significant infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Pulmonary hypoplasia","explanation":"\nPulmonary hypoplasia manifests in the neonatal period with features of respiratory distress (e.g., intercostal retractions, tachypnea, cyanosis). However, neither wheezing nor crackles would be expected, and a chest x-ray would show decreased lung volume instead of atelectasis interspersed with hyperinflation. In addition, newborns with this condition typically have other congenital abnormalities (e.g., Potter sequence, rib deformities, anasarca, scaphoid abdomen) as a result of the pathological processes that ultimately lead to pulmonary hypoplasia (e.g., oligohydramnios, thoracic dystrophy, fetal hydrops, diaphragmatic hernia). None of these congenital abnormalities are reported in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Neonatal pneumonia","explanation":"This infant has several risk factors for pneumonia, including prematurity and prolonged intubation. Although aspects of his clinical presentation are consistent with pneumonia (e.g., labored breathing, cyanosis, crackles), other features of neonatal infection such as lethargy, temperature instability, and poor perfusion would be expected. Typical chest x-ray findings of neonatal pneumonia include bilateral alveolar densities with air bronchograms or irregular patchy infiltrates. This patient's x-ray findings are more consistent with a different condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Meconium aspiration syndrome","explanation":"\nNewborns with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) develop hypoxia immediately after birth and may require mechanical ventilation. Also, a chest x-ray in MAS would show interspersed areas of atelectasis and hyperinflation, which are seen here. However, MAS typically occurs in term and post-term rather than preterm infants; this infant's low body weight suggests that he was born preterm. Moreover, MAS would not explain the new-onset respiratory distress that occurred in this patient one week after discharge from the NICU. In infants with a history of MAS, cyanosis can remain even after the clinical features of MAS resolve if persistent pulmonary hypertension develops. However, chest x-ray is usually normal and crackles would not be expected in such a scenario.","bool":false}]},{"id":59,"info":"Respiratory System","question":"A 55-year-old man with recurrent pneumonia comes to the physician for a follow-up examination one week after hospitalization for pneumonia.

These cells are responsible for which of the following functions?","difficulty":4,"hint":"Clustered, proliferating cuboidal cells from an affected area of the lung are consistent with type II pneumocytes.","answers":[{"option":"Lecithin production","explanation":"\nLecithin refers to a class of fatty substances used by type II pneumocytes to produce lung surfactant. Lecithin is stored as lamellar bodies in the cytoplasm, giving the cells their foamy appearance. When released, these amphipathic molecules decrease the surface tension in alveoli and increase lung compliance, thus facilitating breathing.","bool":true},{"option":"Gas diffusion","explanation":"Gas diffusion in the respiratory portion of the lungs occurs through the extremely thin type I pneumocytes. This thinness is established by localizing all organelles close to the nucleus, leaving a two-membrane thick surface area for gas diffusion. These cells are unable to replicate and would not appear as proliferating cells in the biopsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Cytokine release","explanation":"\nAlveolar macrophages are a major source of cytokine release in the lower lung. Macrophages also take on a foamy appearance through the accumulation of digested fats that the cells scavenge. However, alveolar macrophages are large and pleomorphic with large eccentric nuclei, unlike the proliferating clusters in this patient's biopsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Toxin degradation","explanation":"Toxin degradation in the lower lung is chiefly conducted by club cells.

The gold standard for diagnosing bacterial tonsillitis is a throat culture, which can identify the underlying pathogen and determine its antibiotic sensitivity. The rapid strep antigen test has poor sensitivity but high specificity. Children and adolescents with a negative rapid strep test should have a throat culture to rule out bacterial infection; up to 30% of infections are missed with rapid antigen detection testing. If the rapid strep antigen test is positive, antibiotic therapy can be started without confirmatory throat culture. If bacterial infection is ruled out (i.e., both antigen testing and culture are negative), observation and symptomatic management (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs) are indicated.","bool":true},{"option":"Penicillin V therapy","explanation":"\nPenicillin V is the treatment of choice for patients with acute group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis and no penicillin allergy.

ASO titer is not useful in diagnosing acute streptococcal infection because antibody levels take about 2 weeks to rise, and do not peak until 3–5 weeks after infection; antibody levels reflect past, rather than current infections. This patient has only been symptomatic for 2 days, therefore an ASO titer would likely be negative, even if his symptoms were due to streptococcal infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Measurement of antiviral capsid antigen IgM antibody","explanation":"An antiviral capsid antigen IgM level is used to diagnose mononucleosis in patients with clinical suspicion despite a negative monospot test. While patients with mononucleosis often have tonsillitis/pharyngitis, this patient is lacking further symptoms such as cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and hepatosplenomegaly.

Hemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain further suggest that PE is complicated by pulmonary infarction, which occurs when the thrombus occludes a smaller segmental artery, resulting in inflammation of the lung parenchyma. The typical CT finding in patients with pulmonary infarction caused by PE is a wedge-shaped opacity near the pleura that does not enhance with contrast. The apex of the wedge is closest to the site of the arterial occlusion, with a triangular area of nonperfusion where the downstream vascular supply is cut off. A wedge-shaped opacity may very rarely be seen on chest x-ray in patients with pulmonary embolism; this radiographic finding is also referred to as Hampton hump.\nThe imaging modality of choice to confirm PE is CT pulmonary angiography, which shows a filling defect of the obstructed pulmonary arteries. This confirmatory finding is also seen in patients without concomitant pulmonary infarction.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased serum creatine kinase-MB activity","explanation":"\nCreatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) is most often used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction (MI). Although an acute MI may also cause sudden-onset chest pain and dyspnea, substernal pressure is typically described, and it should not change in intensity with inspiration. In addition, acute MI would not cause hemoptysis, and fever would be unusual.","bool":false},{"option":"Widespread ST elevation on ECG","explanation":"Widespread ST elevation and PR-segment depression on ECG suggest acute pericarditis, which manifests with pleuritic chest pain. However, patients with pericarditis will often have a prodrome of fever, malaise, and myalgias, and the pain is typically relieved by sitting or leaning forward. A friction rub is also common on cardiac auscultation.

In a previously healthy adult without known cardiac disease or other heart failure symptoms (e.g., peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, orthopnea), this finding would be concerning for ARDS. This condition could explain this patient's cough and dyspnea, but ARDS also causes severe respiratory distress, including even more marked tachypnea and hypoxia than reported here, and often an altered mental status. Lastly, ARDS would cause diffuse crackles on auscultation.","bool":false},{"option":"Thrombus in the left atrium on TEE","explanation":"\nThrombus formation in the left atrium most commonly occurs in patients with atrial fibrillation (A-fib), which causes abnormal contraction of the atrium leading to stasis of blood. While this patient has some risk factors for A-fib (hypertension, alcohol ingestion), her presentation is not consistent with this diagnosis. A-fib is usually asymptomatic, but it can manifest with weakness, fatigue, and lightheadedness. Pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis are not common features of this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Tracheal deviation on x-ray of the chest","explanation":"\nPneumothorax can manifest with sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. Tracheal deviation on chest x-ray (away from the side of the lesion) is a more concerning feature and suggests tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention to prevent hemodynamic collapse. While smoking is a risk factor for spontaneous pneumothorax, hemoptysis would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased expiratory flow on peak flow meter","explanation":"\nPeak expiratory flow rate is decreased in obstructive lung disease, and peak flow meter measurement is often used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in patients presenting with acute asthma exacerbations. Both asthma and COPD can cause dyspnea and cough, as well as increase the risk of respiratory infection.

Further radiographic features of pleural effusion include a homogeneous density with a meniscus-shaped margin (meniscus sign) as well as complete opacification of the lung and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side in cases of large effusions. Thoracentesis is the most effective method for managing pleural effusion and also allows for analysis of the pleural fluid to help establish the underlying etiology.\nThis patient's recent weight loss and long history of cigarette smoking suggest that the most likely cause of pleural effusion is lung cancer.

While all of these conditions may manifest with dyspnea and cough, further characteristic symptoms are absent (e.g., fever, protracted disease course, crackles or rales on auscultation). In addition, ground-glass opacities are frequently hard to detect on x-ray and are better visualized on CT scan.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevation of diaphragm","explanation":"Elevation of the diaphragm on chest x-ray in a patient with dyspnea can indicate atelectasis. While the auscultation findings are the same as those seen in this patient, atelectasis usually either manifests with sudden onset of acute dyspnea (e.g., following foreign body inhalation) or is asymptomatic if insidious in onset (e.g., due to lung fibrosis). Another condition that manifests with elevation of the diaphragm and dyspnea is paralysis of the phrenic nerve. However, unilateral paresis does usually not manifest with dyspnea and bilateral paresis would manifest with sudden onset of severe dyspnea.","bool":false},{"option":"Widened intercostal spaces","explanation":"Widening of the intercostal spaces on chest x-ray is caused by chronic hyperinflation of the lungs in emphysema.

Abnormal, permanent dilation of the air spaces (emphysema) caused by loss of elastic tissue and air trapping behind collapsed or obstructed bronchioles increases residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC). Narrowing of the airways, which is seen in patients with COPD, increases the resistance to air flow and consequently decreases forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and the Tiffeneau-Pinelli index (FEV1/FVC).

Metabolic compensation (elevated HCO3-) is usually also present and indicates that the hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis is chronic. Obesity reduces inspiratory muscle strength and restricts respiratory excursions, resulting in alveolar hypoventilation. Moreover, obesity is associated with increased production of CO2 as a result of the larger body surface area, further contributing to hypercapnia.

A suspected diagnosis is confirmed via culture from infected material (e.g., sputum).","bool":true},{"option":"Poor oral hygiene","explanation":"Poor oral hygiene is a predisposing factor for infection with Actinomyces spp., which is also a gram-positive, branching, rod-shaped bacteria. Thoracic actinomycosis can manifest with a cough and hemoptysis, similar to this patient. However, Actinomyces are nonacid fast, anaerobic bacteria, and infection does not usually cause lobar pneumonia.","bool":false},{"option":"Crowded living situation","explanation":"Congregate settings (e.g., hospitals, homeless shelters) can be a predisposing factor for several infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which also appears as gram-positive, acid-fast bacteria on light microscopy. Although tuberculosis classically presents with pulmonary symptoms such as productive cough and hemoptysis, chest x-ray would typically show upper lobe cavitary lung lesions, rather than lobar pneumonia. The presence of branching filaments on this patient's culture is also not consistent with a diagnosis of tuberculosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Exposure to contaminated air-conditioning unit","explanation":"Warm aqueous environments such as air conditioning units can be a habitat for Legionella pneumophila. Infection with L. pneumophila can cause Legionnaires' disease (especially in immunocompromised individuals) and present with atypical or lobar pneumonia. However, this patient lacks other classic features of Legionnaires' disease such as gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea). Moreover, L. pneumophila does not stain with acid-fast staining and would require silver staining for detection.","bool":false},{"option":"Sharing of unsterile IV needles","explanation":"Sharing of unsterile IV needles (e.g., IV drug use) is a risk factor for blood-borne infections including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV infection.

In emphysema, alveolar collapse due to loss of lung parenchyma leads to decreased flow rates during the latter part of expiration, creating the scooped-out appearance of the expiratory limb. In addition, the loop shifts to the left, because the residual volume is abnormally high due to air trapping and hyperinflation. Further causes of an obstructive pattern on a flow-volume loop include asthma, bronchiolitis, and bronchiectasis.","bool":true},{"option":"Endotracheal neoplasm","explanation":"Endotracheal neoplasms (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma) can cause fixed upper airway obstruction. This patient's smoking history puts her at risk of endotracheal neoplasms, which commonly manifest with shortness of breath, cough, and weight loss. However, a fixed upper airway obstruction would cause flow limitation throughout respiration, showing flattening of both the inspiratory and expiratory limb on a flow-volume loop.","bool":false},{"option":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","explanation":"\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a potential cause of restrictive lung disease. This patient's smoking history puts her at risk for IPF, which commonly manifests with progressive dyspnea and cough. However, as in any restrictive lung disease, the flow-volume loop would show a substantially decreased total lung capacity due to the lung parenchyma's inability to fully expand (i.e., decreased compliance). The peak flow is decreased in IPF, but not as low as would be expected given the decreased lung volume. This is because expiratory flows are increased by the enhanced elastic recoil of fibrosed lung parenchyma.","bool":false},{"option":"Chronic asthma","explanation":"\nAsthma is an obstructive lung disease, and, thus, consistent with this patient's low-volume loop showing a concave upward expiratory limb. Moreover, chronic cough, dyspnea, hypoxia and decreased breath sounds on auscultation are common features of chronic asthma. However, although new-onset asthma in late adulthood is possible, this patient's long-standing history of smoking, recent weight loss, and the absence of a history of atopy or allergic disease make a different diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Unilateral mainstem obstruction","explanation":"The most common causes of unilateral mainstem obstruction are foreign body aspiration, which can easily be ruled out here, and tumors. Indeed, progressive cough, dyspnea, and weight loss in a patient with a smoking history should raise suspicion for respiratory malignancy. Moreover, unilateral mainstem obstruction would also show increased residual volume on flow-volume loop due to the impaired expiration of the air in the obstructed airway. However, in contrast to the flow-volume loop in this patient, the shape of the inspiratory and expiratory limb would typically be normal with a decreased vital capacity. During forceful expiration, the flow would quickly reach a peak flow below normal and then decline nearly linearly to the residual volume.","bool":false},{"option":"Neuromuscular weakness","explanation":"Neuromuscular weakness of the respiratory muscles can lead to shortness of breath, hypoxia, and (often ineffective) cough, all of which this patient has. Moreover, difficulty swallowing due to concomitant bulbar dysfunction may result in weight loss.

This condition is caused by air trapping in the pleural space, which, if severe enough, can compress the adjacent structures (e.g., contralateral lung, mediastinum) and impair venous return to the heart. This can cause life-threatening cardiopulmonary collapse, which manifests with severe hypotension and tachycardia.

Another characteristic feature of this condition is eggshell calcification.","answers":[{"option":"Silicosis","explanation":"This patient's presentation with chronic cough, dyspnea on exertion, and diffuse fine crackles over upper lung fields is suggestive of interstitial lung disease (ILD). The most likely cause of this patient's ILD is exposure-related, given his occupation as a quarry worker for 10 years (inhalation of crystalline silica). Silica is typically found below the earth's surface and most commonly affects the upper lobes of the lungs, as seen on this chest x-ray. While silicosis is typically a clinical diagnosis, a lung biopsy would show silicotic nodules. Patients with silicosis are at increased risk for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and should have an annual TB skin test.","bool":true},{"option":"Sarcoidosis","explanation":"\nSarcoidosis most commonly affects the pulmonary system and manifests as interstitial fibrosis with chronic cough, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue.

Neoplastic growth of the anterior and middle mediastinal lymph nodes causes these structures to expand and impinge on the surrounding anatomy (e.g., SVC and esophagus). The superior vena cava is directly adjacent to these chains of lymph nodes, and even partial obstruction of the SVC can manifest clinically. Coupled with the absence of risk factors for lung cancer or evidence of a soft tissue mass in the apices (which is seen in cases of Pancoast tumor), clinical evidence of impingement on other mediastinal structures (e.g., dysphagia from esophageal impingement) and the radiographic finding of a widened mediastinum make mediastinal lymphoma the most likely diagnosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Pancoast tumor","explanation":"\nPancoast tumors can manifest with progressive superior vena cava obstruction. However, Pancoast tumors are classically associated with shoulder pain, Horner syndrome, and a positive smoking history, none of which are present in this case.

This patient's chest x-ray showing a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field further supports this diagnosis. Altered consciousness is a risk factor for aspiration and is classically seen in alcohol use disorder, sedation, general anesthesia, and seizures. This patient's history of gastric reflux is an additional risk factor for aspiration, as it indicates lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction, which can lead to the regurgitation of gastric contents into the esophagus.\nFurther risk factors for aspiration include neurodegenerative conditions associated with reduced gag reflex and dysphagia, such as stroke, Parkinson disease, dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or myasthenia gravis.","bool":true},{"option":"Tuberculosis","explanation":"\nTuberculosis (TB) can manifest with cough, fever, night sweats, and poor appetite.

These findings are consistent with pneumomediastinum.","answers":[{"option":"Bronchial rupture","explanation":"\nTracheobronchial injuries such as a bronchial rupture can occur after a high-speed trauma. A bronchial rupture can present with Hamman sign (as a result of the pneumomediastinum) and respiratory acidosis (due to alveolar hypoventilation from airway obstruction and atelectasis). The dullness on percussion in the right hemithorax suggests a fluid collection. In the context of recent trauma, this finding likely represents an associated hemothorax. Patients with a tracheobronchial injury may develop a pneumothorax or a pneumomediastinum which reaccumulates even after a thoracostomy.","bool":true},{"option":"Pulmonary embolism","explanation":"\nPulmonary embolism can be caused by embolism of fat following a femoral fracture and typically presents with nonspecific findings including pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion.

Patients with an aortic dissection can present with an acute onset of severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the back, hypertension (though hypotension is also seen when the dissection is complicated by cardiac tamponade or aortic rupture), weak or asymmetric peripheral pulses, and different blood pressures in the upper extremities. Pneumomediastinum is not a feature of aortic dissection.","bool":false},{"option":"Myocardial rupture","explanation":"\nMyocardial rupture can be caused by blunt chest trauma.

Furthermore, neither an S4 expected of a noncompliant hypertrophied ventricle nor a family history of sudden cardiac death in young relatives is present with this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Blockade of the right bundle branch","explanation":"\nRight bundle branch block (RBBB) is a cardiac conduction deficit that can cause a widely split S2. Although RBBB can manifest with dyspnea due to underlying diseases, it is typically asymptomatic.","bool":false},{"option":"Calcification of the pulmonary valve","explanation":"Calcification of the pulmonary valve can cause pulmonary stenosis, resulting in fatigue, dyspnea, and splitting of S2. Calcification of the pulmonary valve is rare but can occur secondary to congenital heart disease, carcinoid heart disease, or age-related changes. This patient is not in a high-risk age group nor does she have any signs of congenital or carcinoid heart disease which would suggest calcification.","bool":false},{"option":"Fibrosis of pulmonary interstitium","explanation":"\nFibrosis of the pulmonary interstitium is seen in pulmonary fibrosis.

Neonatal conjunctivitis due to C. trachomatis typically manifests 5–14 days after birth and likely explains this patient's mucopurulent eye discharge and swelling. Chlamydial pneumonia, which usually manifests 4–12 weeks after birth, is accompanied by neonatal conjunctivitis in 50% of cases and is characterized by a staccato cough with or without low-grade fever and features of interstitial pneumonia on chest x-ray. C. trachomatis infection is treated with macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin). Prenatal screening for C. trachomatis infection is indicated for pregnant women &lt; 25 years of age.","bool":true},{"option":"Bordetella pertussis","explanation":"\nBordetella pertussis infection (pertussis) can result in nasal discharge and cough without fever during the catarrhal stage, which may be brief in young infants. The catarrhal stage would be followed by paroxysms of a staccato cough with hypoxemia, as seen here (paroxysmal stage). Young infants are also at higher risk of developing complications of pertussis, such as pneumonia, and a lack of prenatal care (e.g., third trimester Tdap immunization) increases the risk of pertussis. However, B. pertussis does not cause neonatal conjunctivitis, so it is not the most likely causal organism.","bool":false},{"option":"Respiratory syncytial virus","explanation":"\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection can cause rhinorrhea, bronchiolitis, and, occasionally, afebrile pneumonia during infancy or the late neonatal period. Both bronchiolitis and pneumonia cause cough, hypoxemia, and crackles on auscultation. Conjunctival injection may be present in patients with RSV infection, as seen here. However, RSV does not cause purulent conjunctivitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Streptococcus agalactiae","explanation":"\nStreptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus; GBS) infection in neonates can manifest as pneumonia, and this patient's mother most likely did not receive prenatal screening for GBS colonization. However, neonatal pneumonia due to GBS would manifest within the first 6 days of life (early-onset GBS infection), whereas the pneumonia in this newborn manifested at 4 weeks of life. Late-onset GBS infection, which occurs 1–12 weeks after birth, usually manifests with neonatal meningitis or neonatal sepsis, but not pneumonia. Moreover, GBS is a rare cause of neonatal conjunctivitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Parainfluenza virus type 1","explanation":"\nParainfluenza virus type 1 typically causes croup, which can manifest with nasal congestion, a cough (classically a “barking seal” cough), and features of respiratory distress (e.g., tachypnea, hypoxemia). Patients may be afebrile or only have a low-grade fever during the prodromal phase. However, croup is characterized by hoarseness and inspiratory stridor, rather than crackles, and it more commonly affects children 6 months to 3 years of age. Moreover, this patient's history of purulent conjunctivitis suggests a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","explanation":"\nStreptococcus pneumoniae can cause pneumonia during infancy and the late neonatal period.

Mycoplasma pneumonia manifests with atypical pneumonia, a cold agglutinin reaction, and a rash. The cold agglutinin reaction is due to IgM antibodies produced in response to the microbe cross-reacting with an antigen on the host RBC, which causes hemolytic anemia and Raynaud phenomenon. This phenomenon typically resolves spontaneously with treatment (e.g., a macrolide antibiotic) and resolution of the infection. Chest x-ray findings in Mycoplasma pneumonia are often disproportionately severe and not commensurate with the severity of the patient's symptoms or examination findings.

Prolonged immobilization is an important risk factor that is a component of the pretest probability for PE (Wells score). In PE, the embolic occlusion of a vessel may lead to increased vessel permeability in the downstream pulmonary vessels, causing pleural effusion. Pleural effusion in PE is typically exudative (80% of cases) and may be hemorrhagic, especially if PE is complicated by pulmonary infarction. While chest x-rays are often normal in patients with PE, features that suggest PE include an enlarged pulmonary artery (Fleischner sign), hyperlucent lung tissue distal to the obstruction (Westermark sign), and a wedge-shaped opacity in the periphery of the lung (Hampton hump).\nDiagnosis is confirmed with CT pulmonary angiography showing a filling defect of the pulmonary arteries, or with ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy.","bool":true},{"option":"Asbestos exposure","explanation":"\nAsbestos exposure is a risk factor for asbestosis and lung malignancies (e.g., lung cancer and mesothelioma), which can also manifest with chest pain, dyspnea, and a bloody, exudative pleural effusion.

His difficulties speaking, altered mental state, use of accessory respiratory muscles (indicating respiratory fatigue), and normal to high Pco2 (≥ 42 mm Hg) are concerning for respiratory failure, for which endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated. Patients with acute asthma exacerbation generally initially present with respiratory alkalosis (decreased Pco2) due to tachypnea. With worsening airway obstruction and increasing respiratory fatigue, Pco2 increases and pH decreases.

The best initial test is the passage of a catheter through the nares, which is not possible in bilateral choanal atresia. Contrast rhinography in the supine position or CT scan of the facial bones confirms the diagnosis. After establishing an oropharyngeal airway, transnasal endoscopic resection of the posterior nasal septum is the most appropriate treatment to provide a permanent nasal airway. These procedures help prevent life-threatening cyanotic attacks and aspiration when the newborn's mouth is blocked during feeding. Finally, the newborn should be examined for other congenital anomalies since choanal atresia is often associated with CHARGE syndrome.\nSplitting of the second heart sound, as seen in this newborn, occurs physiologically during inspiration, which leads to delayed closure of the pulmonary valve (P2) due to increased right ventricular ejection time.","bool":true},{"option":"Endotracheal administration of artificial surfactant","explanation":"Endotracheal administration of artificial surfactant is indicated in patients with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), a condition caused by surfactant deficiency in preterm infants.

Differentiation of type II pneumocytes occurs between weeks 24–34 of gestation, leading to an increase in surfactant production in preparation for lung expansion postpartum. Low amounts of surfactant in premature infants predispose them to NRDS due to alveolar collapse. Artificial surfactant should be administered to this infant.

COPD is characterized by pulmonary inflammation resulting in fibrosis, airway obstruction, and capillary loss. Subsequent hypoxia and hypercapnia cause compensatory pulmonary vasoconstriction. The combination of hypoxic vasoconstriction and chronic inflammation triggers vascular remodeling, which, in turn, causes elevated pulmonary capillary pressure and pulmonary hypertension. Chronic, untreated pulmonary hypertension puts a strain on the right ventricle, causing concentric hypertrophy and progressive decline in right cardiac function, eventually leading to symptoms of decompensated right heart failure, as seen in this patient.\n\n\n\n","bool":true},{"option":"Left-sided systolic heart failure","explanation":"\nLeft-sided heart failure with systolic dysfunction (i.e., reduced left ventricular ejection fraction) can lead to pulmonary vascular congestion with increased pulmonary venous pressure and subsequent pulmonary hypertension. Over time, this can result in right ventricular strain, hypertrophy, and, ultimately, right-sided heart failure. Although LV systolic heart failure is the most common cause of right-sided heart failure, it is unlikely to be the underlying cause of this patient's condition, since he has a normal ejection fraction (∼ 60%) and shows no signs of left-sided heart failure (e.g., pulmonary edema with dyspnea, bilateral basilar rales).","bool":false},{"option":"Chronic occlusion of the pulmonary vessels","explanation":"Chronic occlusion of the pulmonary vessels (e.g., chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) is a form of pulmonary hypertension that can also lead to right-sided heart failure. However, this patient has no history of major risk factors (e.g., immobilization, hypercoagulability, malignancy) and a different etiology is much more likely given his underlying COPD.","bool":false},{"option":"Ventricular septal defect","explanation":"\nVentricular septal defect (VSD) arises from the incomplete closure of the ventricular septum during fetal development. Initially, VSDs cause a left to right shunt that increases blood flow through the pulmonary circulation. The resulting pulmonary hypertension can then, over time, cause right ventricular hypertrophy and subsequent right-sided heart failure. A VSD is unlikely in this patient given absence of a holosystolic murmur and his age.","bool":false},{"option":"Excessive systemic collagen deposition","explanation":"Excessive collagen deposition in the pulmonary tissue and arteries is characteristic of connective tissue disorders such as systemic sclerosis. This process can cause inflammation, interstitial thickening, and vascular dysfunction, which can result in pulmonary arterial hypertension and subsequent right-sided heart failure. However, right heart failure secondary to connective tissue disorders is commonly a late complication that is preceded by a long history of systemic symptoms (skin manifestations, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility). Furthermore, this patient' s history of COPD makes a different cause much more likely.","bool":false}]},{"id":190,"info":"Respiratory System","question":"A 42-year-old woman with hypertension comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of persistent reddening of her face, daytime fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.

Her blood pressure is 145/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows erythema of the face that is especially pronounced around the cheeks, nose, and ears. Fasting serum glucose concentration is 96 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's facial discoloration?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This overweight patient has increased daytime sleepiness and impaired concentration, making obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) a likely diagnosis.","answers":[{"option":"Increased erythropoietin production","explanation":"In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nighttime obstruction of the upper airways (e.g., resulting from obesity) leads to apneic episodes, hypoxia, and poor quality of sleep. Sleep deprivation causes daytime sleepiness and impaired concentration, while hypoxia triggers renal erythropoietin secretion and increased production of RBCs in the bone marrow, resulting in a characteristic red discoloration of the face (plethora). Chronic hypoxia can also trigger a sympathetic response, which could explain this patient's hypertension.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased bradykinin production","explanation":"Increased bradykinin production is the cause of angioedema, which can be caused by ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril) and occasionally result in facial erythema. However, swelling of the face would be evident and fatigue would not be expected with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema.\n\n","bool":false},{"option":"Increased serum cortisol levels","explanation":"Increased serum cortisol levels are a diagnostic finding in individuals with Cushing syndrome, which can cause hypertension, obesity, fatigue, and facial plethora.

Upon removal of the knife, the patient could hemorrhage and rapidly deteriorate. Emergency surgery is indicated to remove the knife in an environment in which bleeding can be controlled. Therefore, this patient should undergo rapid sequence endotracheal intubation in anticipation of emergency surgery.

Patients with theophylline toxicity are at risk of life-threatening seizures and cardiac arrhythmias. Because theophylline has a very narrow therapeutic index, drug levels should be monitored regularly. Elimination of theophylline occurs via the cytochrome P450 system, which can be inhibited by cimetidine (currently being used by this patient), resulting in decreased clearance and, consequently, increased plasma levels of theophylline.

In cases of massive PE with hemodynamic instability (e.g., SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg), thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) such as alteplase is indicated. Because of the associated significant risk of bleeding, there are several relative and absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Surgery within the past 10 days is a relative contraindication, but this patient underwent surgery 3 weeks ago. Therefore, alteplase would be the most appropriate treatment.

The best initial test in the case of suspected histoplasmosis, especially for patients who are acutely ill, is a urine or serum test for the galactomannan antigen of H. capsulatum. This test is less specific because of crossreaction with antigens of other fungi. A fungal culture of bronchoalveolar lavage is more specific but takes longer (up to 6 weeks).

However, the yeast cells of Paracoccidioides spp. are typically 20–60 μm in size (larger than an erythrocyte) and form a characteristic captain's wheel formation. Moreover, acute paracoccidioidomycosis (juvenile paracoccidioidomycosis) typically affects children and adolescents and would cause lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and aplastic anemia, not pulmonary symptoms.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Influenza virus is a segmented ssRNA virus with a helical capsid. Children and older individuals are at greatest risk for developing severe disease.","answers":[{"option":"Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin","explanation":"\nSerum antibodies against hemagglutinin are responsible for immunological protection against influenza virus infections. In the absence of host antibodies against hemagglutinin, influenza virions use hemagglutinin to bind to sialic acid residues on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells and gain entry into the cell. Once inside, the virus can replicate and eventually produce the clinical aspects of the flu.

The son, therefore, is most likely to have avoided infection as a result of having these neutralizing antibodies.","bool":true},{"option":"Vaccination with polyribosylribitol phosphate","explanation":"\nVaccination with polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) confers immunity against Hemophilus influenzae. PRP is the immunogenic capsular polysaccharide of H. influenzae contained in the Hib vaccine. Prior to the introduction of the Hib vaccine, invasive infection with H. influenzae (e.g., meningitis, pneumonia, and epiglottitis) was common, but the incidence of these infections has sharply declined thanks to widespread vaccination. However, the infectious agent in this scenario is a virus whereas H. influenzae is a gram-negative coccobacillus.","bool":false},{"option":"Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions","explanation":"\nProtease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions help protect against bacterial strains that produce IgA protease (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae). IgA protease functions to cleave serum IgA, making the host mucous membranes more susceptible to bacterial colonization or infection. However, secretory IgA are resistant to numerous IgA protease subtypes. The presence of these protease-resistant IgA antibodies may help explain why certain individuals are less likely to develop infections with IgA protease-producing bacteria. However, the infectious agent in this scenario is the influenza virus, which does not produce IgA protease and is not the target of secretory IgA antibodies.","bool":false},{"option":"High concentration of circulating T cells","explanation":"A high concentration of circulating T cells is fundamental to a functioning immune system, and T-cell count decreases naturally with age, slightly increasing the risk of infection. Although the son is likely to have a higher concentration of T cells than his 75-year-old mother, the immunological benefit would not amount to an added protective effect against the influenza virus, making another option more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Downregulation of ICAM-1 expression","explanation":"Downregulation of ICAM-1 expression might be a mechanism to reduce the probability of infection with a rhinovirus. These pathogens rely on the ICAM-1 receptor on respiratory epithelium to gain entry into host cells and cause infection.

Moreover, rhinovirus has an icosahedral capsid and a linear genome, unlike the virus described here.","bool":false},{"option":"Homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene","explanation":"\nHomozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene (most often CCR5-Δ32, in which a premature stop codon prevents normal protein production) confers resistance to HIV infection. CCR5 is used as a coreceptor for HIV entry into host cells, so that alterations in this protein make viral entry into host cells impossible. Acute infection with HIV is frequently asymptomatic but may manifest with fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough, which are also seen in this patient.

This floating rib cage segment is decoupled from the chest wall and causes paradoxical chest movement. Upon inspiration, as the intrathoracic pressure drops, the unstable segment will be pulled inwards by the negative pressure, and during expiration, the floating segment moves outward. This condition usually results from high-energy blunt trauma to the chest (e.g., motor vehicle collision).

Burn-related injury of the airways (often in combination with fluid resuscitation) can lead to the rapid development of upper airway edema and obstruction. Therefore, immediate intubation is necessary if inhalation injury is suspected or if burns involve more than 30–40% of the body surface, as seen here. Although this patient currently has no signs of impending respiratory decompensation (e.g., severe hypoxia, tachypnea) and only a mildly altered level of consciousness (GCS of 12), intubation and mechanical ventilation are the most appropriate next steps to prevent sudden airway obstruction and respiratory failure.","bool":true},{"option":"Disseminated bacterial infection","explanation":"Disseminated bacterial infection is a possible complication of burn injuries, as burn wounds are often colonized by multiple pathogens (e.g., MRSA, Pseudomonas). In addition, prolonged exposure to smoke (e.g., due to entrapment in closed spaces) causes ciliary dysfunction, which decreases the clearance of airway secretions and increases the risk of bacterial pneumonia. This patient's burns involve &gt; 30% of the body surface, which can lead to immunosuppression, increasing her risk of developing an infection.

Type IV HSR is mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Donor antigens in the transplanted lung present on MHC class II of the host's antigen-presenting cells (APCs) stimulate CD4 T cells, which subsequently differentiate into Th1 cells. Proliferating Th1 cells release proinflammatory cytokine (e.g., interferon-gamma) that stimulates the infiltration of macrophages into the vasculature and graft parenchyma. Likewise, expression of MHC class I on donor cells stimulates host CD8 T cells, leading to a direct CD8-mediated cytotoxic damage in the donor cells. Type II HSR results from the production of IgM and/or IgG antibodies, which bind donor antigens on the transplanted lung and induce complement-dependent or independent death of donor cells.","bool":true},{"option":"Donor rhesus D antigen","explanation":"Donor rhesus D antigen can lead to hyperacute rejection in cases of Rh incompatibility.

Antagonized G protein-coupled leukotriene receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells cannot bind leukotrienes released by inflammatory cells, which results in reduced bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are used as a second-line or additional treatment for mild to moderate chronic asthma because they generally have less efficacy than inhaled glucocorticoids and long-acting beta-2 receptor agonists, the former of which, in a low dose, would likely be preferred in this case.\nLTRAs tend to function particularly well in a subset of asthma patients who have exercise-induced or aspirin-exacerbated symptoms, or whose exacerbations are triggered by viral infections.","bool":true},{"option":"Inhibition of phosphodiesterase","explanation":"Inhibition of phosphodiesterase is the mechanism of action of theophylline. Without hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase, intracellular cAMP concentrations increase, which leads to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. However, theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index and is associated with significant toxicity (nausea, vomiting, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias); therefore, theophylline is not often used in children. Zafirlukast does not act on phosphodiesterase.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of mast cell degranulation","explanation":"Inhibition of mast cell degranulation is the mechanism of action of cromolyn and nedocromil, both of which are mast cell stabilizers. These agents prevent the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells, thereby reducing bronchospasms in asthmatics. Zafirlukast, however, does not act via this mechanism of action.","bool":false},{"option":"Antagonism at muscarinic receptors","explanation":"\nAntagonism at muscarinic receptors is the mechanism of action of ipratropium and tiotropium. Muscarinic receptor antagonism alleviates bronchoconstriction and reduces mucus secretion in the respiratory tract. Ipratropium and tiotropium are commonly used to treat acute asthma exacerbations and COPD. However, they are not typically used to treat chronic asthma as seen in this patient. Zafirlukast does not act via this mechanism of action.","bool":false},{"option":"Inactivation of NF-κB","explanation":"Inactivation of NF-κB is the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids. NF-κB inhibition results in decreased transcription of cytokines and other inflammation-associated molecules; it also inhibits bronchial inflammation by suppressing both B-cell and T-cell function. Low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids are a first-line treatment for mild chronic asthma and would likely be recommended in addition to this patient's albuterol inhaler. However, inactivation of NF-κB is not the mechanism of action of zafirlukast.","bool":false},{"option":"Binding of IgE antibodies","explanation":"Binding of IgE is the mechanism of action of the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab. Omalizumab is used in the treatment of severe allergic asthma involving high levels of IgE. This patient has mild to moderate exercise-induced asthma, so omalizumab would be inappropriate. Zafirlukast does not act via this mechanism of action.","bool":false},{"option":"Blockade of 5-lipoxygenase pathway","explanation":"Blockade of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway is the mechanism of action of zileuton. The drug selectively inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes by 5-lipoxygenase, thereby inhibiting the bronchospastic process initiated by proinflammatory leukotrienes. Zafirlukast, however, does not act via this mechanism of action.","bool":false}]},{"id":260,"info":"Respiratory System","question":"A 23-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 2 hours after the sudden onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain.

These symptoms in conjunction with a history of severe underlying pulmonary disease should raise concern for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP).","answers":[{"option":"Apical subpleural cyst rupture","explanation":"This patient with cystic fibrosis most likely developed an SSP due to the rupture of a dilated apical subpleural cyst. Approximately 3–4% of all patients with cystic fibrosis will have spontaneous pneumothorax, and this risk increases to 20% in patients older than 18 years. Air trapping is the result of chronic inflammation, bronchiectasis, and bronchial obstruction caused by the accumulation of thick mucus. Air trapping increases the pressure in already damaged alveolar tissue and this accumulation of pressure can lead to cyst rupture and thus pneumothorax.\nCOPD, particularly emphysema, is the most common cause of SSP, accounting for approximately 50–70% of cases. Other causes of SSP include pulmonary infections (e.g., pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumocystis pneumonia), Marfan syndrome, and malignancy.","bool":true},{"option":"Pulmonary parenchymal fibrosis","explanation":"Pulmonary parenchymal fibrosis is seen in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD).

However, she lacks typical signs of infection such as fever and a productive cough. Although breath sounds are commonly diminished over the affected lung field in pneumonia, increased, not decreased, tactile fremitus would be expected due to parenchymal consolidation. Pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis are often associated with bacterial infection; however, the most common pathogens are gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, as well as Staphylococcus aureus.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased pulmonary capillary permeability","explanation":"Increased pulmonary capillary permeability can cause pulmonary edema and abnormal breath sounds on pulmonary auscultation.

NRDS is most common in premature infants because adequate surfactant concentration is not reached until 34 weeks' gestation.

NRDS manifests up to 72 hours after birth with signs and symptoms of acute respiratory distress such as tachypnea (i.e., respiratory rate &gt; 60/min), cyanosis, nasal flaring, expiratory grunting, intercostal retractions, and decreased breath sounds. Treatment primarily consists of noninvasive ventilation via nasal continuous positive airway pressure. If ventilation alone is unsuccessful, artificial surfactant can be administered endotracheally (see “Overview of NDRDS and its differential diagnoses” table).\nAs the lungs mature, lecithin levels, the major component of surfactant, increases.

Careful monitoring of the heart rate is important because epinephrine can worsen tachycardia. In addition to epinephrine, oral or parenteral glucocorticoids (usually dexamethasone) are indicated in all patients with croup.

Pregnancy and the postpartum period are risk factors for the development of venous thrombosis and subsequent PE. During pregnancy, compression of the venous system due to an enlarged uterus can result in venous stasis, one of the three components of the Virchow triad. Another component is hypercoagulability, which is classically seen in pregnant women due to an increase in coagulation factors and decreased levels of protein S. In addition, endothelial damage may occur during labor, thereby increasing the risk of thrombosis during the postpartum period.\nEstablishing the diagnosis of PE during pregnancy can be challenging because many manifestations overlap with normal pregnancy-related changes (e.g., dyspnea, leg swelling, tachycardia, decreased blood pressure). In this patient, features that can help to distinguish PE from normal pregnancy findings include the presence of JVD, asymmetric leg edema, and unilateral dullness to percussion of the lung, which suggests pleural effusion. In patients with PE, pleural effusion can occur if the occluded pulmonary artery causes tissue ischemia (i.e., pulmonary infarction), which leads to increased permeability of pulmonary vessels.","bool":true},{"option":"Myocardial infarction","explanation":"\nMyocardial infarction (MI) can manifest with acute-onset chest pain and dyspnea.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"If this child could participate in spirometry, it would show reversible airflow obstruction. ","answers":[{"option":"Asthma","explanation":"A history of episodic dyspnea and cough that worsens at night and with exercise is highly suggestive of asthma. A normal chest x-ray, normal vital parameters when asymptomatic, and an auscultatory wheeze further support the clinical diagnosis of asthma. A history of other allergies (e.g., peanut allergy) raises suspicion of an atopic predisposition, making allergic, i.e. extrinsic asthma, which typically develops before 7 years of age, the most likely diagnosis.\nSpirometry is the initial test of choice in patients ≥ 6 years of age. Findings of an obstructive lung pattern (↓ FEV1, ↓ FEV1/FVC ratio) that reverses with bronchodilation would confirm a diagnosis of asthma. Spirometry may be attempted in children &lt; 6 years of age, but results are often unreliable. Therefore, diagnosis is largely dependant on a detailed history and the response to a trial of asthma medication. If the diagnosis is still nonconclusive, a methacholine challenge test may be attempted or watchful waiting initiated. Support x-ray is not always indicated and, if done, can be normal in mild cases of asthma or may show evidence of hyperinflation (e.g., flattened diaphragm, wide intercostal spaces).

T-cell dysfunction and increased B-cell activity lead to local immune hyperactivity, inflammation, and subsequent formation of noncaseating granulomas. The lung and the lymphatic system are most commonly affected, although sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder that can affect any organ. In sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases, the expression of 1α-hydroxylase is increased in macrophages.

Both conditions manifest with a chronic cough and exertional dyspnea; however, they also typically manifest with expectoration, cyanosis, and weight loss. This patient's smoking history is a risk factor for COPD and emphysema, but she is still quite young to develop it. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency would also often lead to liver disease (e.g., hepatitis, hepatomegaly, cirrhosis).

Bilateral increase in V/Q can be seen with exercise, during which there is physiologic vasodilation of the apical capillaries, resulting in increased perfusion of the apices with matched ventilation. A bilateral decrease in both ventilation and perfusion can be seen in patients with emphysema due to the destruction of both the alveoli and the capillary bed. Other possibilities include the combination of two separate conditions, of which one causes alveolar hypoventilation (e.g., opioid intoxication) and the other causes pulmonary hypoperfusion (e.g., right-sided heart failure, severe hypotension).

DVT is the most common cause of pulmonary embolism (PE), which typically presents with sharp chest pain and shortness of breath, as seen here. In PE, occlusion of one or more of the pulmonary arteries leads to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, which results in an increased A-a gradient and hypoxemia.

Oxygen therapy in patients with chronically impaired oxygenation from COPD should be titrated to a saturation of 88–92% to avoid oxygen-induced hypercapnia and CO2 narcosis, which is seen here. Alveolar hyperoxia inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, leading to increased perfusion of poorly ventilated alveoli (i.e., worsening ventilation-perfusion mismatch). The resulting increased dead space ventilation is thought to be the major contributor to acute hypercapnia. In addition, accumulating oxyhemoglobin facilitates CO2 release from RBCs (Haldane effect). Contrary to prior belief, reduced hypoxic respiratory drive is only responsible for a small increase of pCO2.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased pulmonary vasoconstriction","explanation":"Increased pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs as a result of hypoxemia (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction) to improve an existing ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and would, therefore, also improve symptoms of AECOPD.

Given this patient's smoking history and underlying cirrhosis, it is important to differentiate between hepatic hydrothorax (transudate) and malignant pleural effusion secondary to lung or liver cancer (exudate). In patients with large symptomatic pleural effusions, diagnostic thoracocentesis can be combined with therapeutic thoracocentesis to provide symptomatic relief.\nPleural fluid drainage is not required if the patient has bilateral pleural effusions that are asymptomatic, of equal sizes, suspected to be due to transudation (based on the presence of an underlying cause such as cirrhosis, cardiac failure, or nephrotic syndrome), and responsive to medical therapy (e.g., diuretics).","bool":true},{"option":"Begin diuretic therapy","explanation":"Administration of diuretics (e.g., furosemide) is an appropriate treatment for hepatic hydrothorax due to cirrhosis, which could explain this patient's pleural effusion.

Mechanical ventilation (especially with a high positive end-expiratory pressure) is considered a risk factor for developing pneumothorax. High ventilatory pressure can damage the lung tissue, causing a leak that allows air to enter the pleural cavity. Because the air entering the pleural space comes from the lung rather than the exterior, it is known as a closed pneumothorax. Following completion of the procedure, another chest x-ray to control the position of chest tube placement should be performed. To prevent further lung damage, the ventilatory pressure should be decreased.\nPneumothorax is often hard to diagnose in ventilated patients. Since the x-ray is obtained in the supine position, less air collects apically, making the pneumothorax less obvious.","bool":true},{"option":"Needle decompression","explanation":"Immediate insertion of a large-bore needle into the 2nd intercostal space along the midclavicular line or the 4th–5th intercostal space between the anterior and midaxillary line is indicated for tension pneumothorax. Although tension pneumothorax may also manifest with decreased oxygen saturation and deep sulcus sign, further findings such as contralateral tracheal deviation, distended neck veins, cyanosis, and hemodynamic instability (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension) are commonly seen.","bool":false},{"option":"CT scan of the chest","explanation":"Indications to obtain a CT scan include uncertain diagnosis despite chest x-ray, suspected underlying lung disease (to determine likelihood of recurrent disease), and presurgical workup. The patient had a chest x-ray that showed deepening of the costophrenic angle, indicating a pneumothorax. Further workup with a chest CT is not needed at this time.","bool":false},{"option":"Increase the PEEP","explanation":"Increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is often necessary when treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with ARDS typically present with acute onset tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, dyspnea, diffuse crackles, and possibly fever, cough, and chest pain. Chest x-ray of patients with ARDS usually reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates, air bronchogram, atelectasis, and pleural effusions. This patient's x-ray indicates a pneumothorax, most likely due to increased pressures during mechanical ventilation. Increasing the PEEP is contraindicated as it would exacerbate his condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Close observation","explanation":"Close observation would be the most appropriate next step in the management of asymptomatic patients with a small primary spontaneous pneumothorax (rim between the lung edge and chest wall &lt; 2–3 cm). Such a pneumothorax usually resolves spontaneously within ∼ 10 days and symptomatic treatment and serial follow-up with repeat chest x-ray are sufficient. This patient is symptomatic, presenting with iatrogenic pneumothorax most likely due to mechanical ventilation, and requires treatment.","bool":false},{"option":"Administer levofloxacin","explanation":"\nRespiratory fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin are the first-line treatment in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia who do not have risk factors for multiresistant pathogens (e.g., prior antibiotic treatment, structural lung disease). Pneumonia typically manifests with high fever and chills, productive cough, tachypnea, and dyspnea. Chest x-ray usually shows extensive opacities restricted to one pulmonary lobe, poorly defined patchy infiltrates, or diffuse reticular opacity. These features are not present in this patient.","bool":false}]},{"id":358,"info":"Respiratory System","question":"\nA 68-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after her family found her unresponsive. She lives alone in her apartment and had called her daughter to report several hours of nausea, headache, and worsening dizziness. The daughter says that she has been trying to convince her mother to move into an assisted living facility. She has been worrying about her wellbeing since the beginning of the winter, especially because her furnace has not been working properly recently. The patient has atrial fibrillation and depression. Current medications are warfarin, metoprolol succinate, and amitriptyline. She is awake but lethargic. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 95/min and irregular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Examination shows a pale reddish coloration of the skin. Serum studies show a prothrombin time of 32.8 sec (INR = 2.5). Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows:\n\n\npH\n\t\t\t7.30\n\t\t\n\nPCO2\n\n\t\t\t37.8 mm Hg\n\t\t\n\nPO2\n\n\t\t\t113 mm Hg\n\t\t\n\nHCO3-\n\n\t\t\t16 mEq/L\n\t\t\n\nFurther evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?\n","difficulty":1,"hint":"Despite a normal PaO2 on arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) and SpO2 on pulse oximetry, this patient should be treated with oxygen.","answers":[{"option":"Elevated carboxyhemoglobin level in blood","explanation":"An elevated blood level of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) confirms carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that can leak from a malfunctioning furnace. CO has a greater affinity for hemoglobin (Hb) than oxygen does, so when it binds to Hb it reduces Hb's oxygen-carrying capacity and shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, thereby decreasing O2 release in tissues. This leads to tissue hypoxia and metabolic acidosis, as seen here. Note that PaO2 is normal as it reflects the amount of dissolved O2 in the blood, which is not affected by CO. Likewise, SpO2 will be normal if a standard pulse oximeter is used as those cannot differentiate between COHb and oxyhemoglobin.\nSymptoms of CO poisoning are variable and depend on the COHb level. Nausea, headache, and dizziness are common early signs. After exposure to high levels of CO, patients may develop a cherry-red skin tone, but this finding is more commonly seen postmortem. Treatment includes supportive care, 100% O2, and occasionally hyperbaric oxygen therapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Elevated methemoglobin level in blood","explanation":"An elevated blood level of methemoglobin (MetHb) typically results from exposure to substances that increase intrinsic production of MetHb (e.g., nitrate-containing drinking water, certain drugs such as nitroglycerin, sulfonamides, and topical anesthetics). In methemoglobinemia, PaO2 is often normal despite evidence of poor tissue oxygenation (i.e., metabolic acidosis), as the amount of dissolved O2 in the blood is unchanged by the presence of MetHb. Likewise, SpO2 will be normal if a standard pulse oximeter is used as those cannot differentiate between methemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin. Symptoms of methemoglobinemia include headache, nausea, dizziness, and lethargy, as seen here. However, it manifests with cyanosis rather than the skin redness seen in this case. Additionally, this patient has no history that suggests ingestion of precipitating agents.","bool":false},{"option":"QRS prolongation on electrocardiogram","explanation":"Prolongation of the QRS complex on an electrocardiogram can be seen in individuals with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. This patient has a history of depression, which increases her risk for suicide attempt with toxic ingestion of her prescribed TCA, amitriptyline. TCA toxicity can cause mental status changes, as well as skin flushing, as seen in this case. However, this patient lacks other common symptoms of TCA overdose, particularly findings of anticholinergic toxicity. Moreover, her initial symptoms of nausea, headache, and dizziness are not typically associated with TCA toxicity.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated cyanide concentration in serum","explanation":"An elevated serum cyanide blood concentration can be found in patients that have been exposed to combustion reactions of plastics, upholstery, rubber, and other nitrogen-containing products, most commonly as a result of house fires. Patients with cyanide poisoning can present very similarly to this patient, with nausea, headache, dizziness, altered mental status, skin flushing, and metabolic acidosis on ABG. However, cyanide poisoning is unlikely in this case as there is no history of a fire at the scene.","bool":false},{"option":"Focal parenchymal hypoattenuation on CT scan of the head","explanation":"A focal parenchymal hypoattenuation on a CT scan of the head can be seen in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases her risk of thromboembolic disease. Headache, nausea, dizziness, and impaired consciousness are possible symptoms of a cerebrovascular event. However, an ischemic stroke is unlikely in the setting of warfarin therapy with a therapeutic INR (2 to 3). Moreover, when an ischemic stroke occurs in a patient with a therapeutic INR, it is typically a lacunar infarct manifesting with focal neurologic deficits (e.g., hemiparesis), which is not seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Calcium oxalate crystals in urinalysis","explanation":"\nCalcium oxalate crystals can be detected in urinalysis of patients following intoxication with ethylene glycol, a substance found in industrial products such as antifreeze solutions and windshield wiper fluid. Poisoning may occur due to ingestion as an ethanol substitute, as a suicide attempt or by accident. Clinical presentation includes an altered mental status and metabolic acidosis, as seen in this patient. Although this patient has a history of depression, which increases the risk of self-harm behavior, she lacks other key findings of ethylene glycol toxicity, including sweet-smelling breath, flank pain, hematuria, and tetany. Moreover, red discoloration of the skin is not typically associated with ethylene glycol poisoning.","bool":false}]}]
