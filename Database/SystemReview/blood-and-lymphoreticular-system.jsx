Impaired NADPH production, in turn, causes impaired regeneration of reduced glutathione, an antioxidant that protects the erythrocyte membrane from oxidative damage. Erythrocyte membranes in patients with G6PD deficiency are, therefore, vulnerable to oxidative stress (e.g., from anti-malaria drugs such as primaquine, or sulfa drugs).

Cold agglutinin disease can also occasionally affect children; in the pediatric population, however, it typically occurs following Mycoplasma pneumonia or infectious mononucleosis. There is no history of a cough, sore throat, or lymphadenopathy to suggest that either of these infections occurred in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Absent hemoglobin beta chain","explanation":"The absence of hemoglobin beta-chain is seen in patients with beta-thalassemia major. Beta-thalassemia major can result in hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly. However, the onset of symptoms in beta-thalassemia major occurs much earlier in life (usually at the end of infancy), and patients typically have massive hepatosplenomegaly (unlike the mild splenomegaly seen in this patient), microcytic anemia, thalassemic facies (e.g., maxillary hyperplasia, frontal bossing), and a history of multiple transfusions in early childhood.","bool":false},{"option":"Lead poisoning","explanation":"Acute lead toxicity can result in abdominal pain and acute hemolytic anemia.

Extensive skeletal destruction caused by bone marrow infiltration predisposes affected patients to vertebral compression fractures and anemia, as indicated by this woman's lower back pain, pallor, and weakness. Patients can present with foamy urine due to light chain proteinuria (Bence Jones proteins).

O2 partial pressure and O2 saturation remain normal because these parameters mainly depend on the inhaled oxygen concentration, atmospheric pressure, and gas exchange in the lungs, none of which is affected by low Hb concentration. Anemia can cause tachycardia, which is seen in this patient, but pallor rather than cyanosis would be expected. Moreover, chocolate-colored blood that does not change color when exposed to oxygen is not seen in anemia.","bool":false},{"option":"C","explanation":"\nMethemoglobinemia is caused by an abundance of methemoglobin, an altered form of hemoglobin in which ferrous iron (Fe2+) is oxidized to the ferric form (Fe3+). Since Fe3+ cannot bind oxygen, arterial O2 saturation and total O2 content decrease. This leads to functional anemia, despite normal hemoglobin concentrations. Patients with methemoglobinemia show clinical signs of cyanosis due to poor tissue oxygenation. O2 partial pressure (PaO2), which reflects the concentration of dissolved oxygen in plasma, is not affected. In patients prone to developing methemoglobinemia (e.g., patients with G6PD deficiency), oxidant drugs such as dapsone and topical anesthetic drugs should be avoided. Treatment consists of converting methemoglobin to hemoglobin by using reducing agents such as methylene blue and vitamin C.\nAlthough prolonged or chronic methemoglobinemia may lead to erythrocytosis or polycythemia, this patient has only been taking her medication for three days.\nSee “Overview of factors that affect oxygenation” table.","bool":true},{"option":"D","explanation":"These arterial blood gas findings are consistent with hypoxemia (e.g., due to impaired gas exchange in the lungs). Impaired oxygenation of the blood decreases both the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma (↓ PaO2) and the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin (↓ SaO2). As a result, the total amount of oxygen transported by arterial blood (i.e., O2 content) will also be reduced. In states of hypoxemia, the hemoglobin concentration is initially unaffected, but may eventually increase due to stimulation of erythropoietin secretion. Hypoxemia can cause signs of cyanosis, which are seen here. However, unlike this patient's blood sample, deoxygenated blood changes color to bright red upon exposure to oxygen.","bool":false},{"option":"E","explanation":"These arterial blood gas findings are consistent with chronic carbon monoxide poisoning (e.g., from cigarette smoke). Since carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin (Hb) with much higher affinity than oxygen (producing carboxyhemoglobin), it cannot easily be displaced. This results in a left shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, which impairs oxygen delivery to the tissues. The amount of oxygen bound to Hb (SaO2) as well as the total arterial O2 content are reduced, while the amount of dissolved oxygen in the plasma (PaO2) remains unaffected. Elevated erythropoietin production secondary to chronic hypoxia induces an increase in Hb. Clinical findings of chronic carbon monoxide include dizziness and seizures, neither of which is seen here.

This translocation results in overexpression of the CMYC gene, which is a proto-oncogene that codes for a transcription factor of the MYC family. The CMYC gene also plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. The subsequent activation of transcription may lead to malignant transformation and tumor growth. The endemic form of Burkitt lymphoma, which typically involves the jaw, is most common in equatorial Africa and South America and is virtually always associated with EBV.","bool":true},{"option":"Inhibition of apoptosis","explanation":"In the cell cycle, there are defined checkpoints and transition points where the cell can be arrested. The p53 tumor suppressor gene, for example, normally initiates apoptosis if DNA damage is present after the G1 phase.

Inhibition of apoptosis, however, is not the mechanism that is directly responsible for the malignant transformation in Burkitt lymphoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Defect in DNA repair","explanation":"\nDNA replication includes control mechanisms to keep the genetic information as stable as possible. In certain breast cancers, for example, a loss-of-function mutation in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 or 2 will lead to DNA errors not being repaired, and, therefore, the occurrence of mutations that may subsequently result in malignant transformation. A defect in DNA repair, however, is not the mechanism that is directly responsible for the malignant transformation in Burkitt lymphoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Impairment of receptor function","explanation":"The impairment of receptor function can lead to nonreceptor function or altered receptor function (loss-of-function mutation). For example, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) caused by errors during DNA replication can produce a point mutation in the receptor which controls the secretion of growth hormone (GH). This leads to an uncontrolled GH secretion, which may play a role in the development of tumors, e.g., lung cancer. However, impairment of receptor function is not directly responsible for the malignant transformation in Burkitt lymphoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of cell cycle arrest","explanation":"In the cell cycle, there are defined checkpoints and transition points at which the cell can be arrested. For example, when DNA is damaged, retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which is a tumor suppressor, is responsible for stopping the progression of G1 phase to S phase. Loss of function of pRb results in both the inhibition of cell cycle arrest and unregulated cell division, which may lead to the development of retinoblastoma. Inhibition of cell cycle arrest, however, is not the mechanism that is directly responsible for the malignant transformation in Burkitt lymphoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Integration of viral DNA","explanation":"The integration of viral DNA into the host's genome causes genetic damage and chromosomal instability, which contribute to oncogenesis. This plays an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma after infection with the hepatitis B virus.

PNH is caused by an acquired genetic mutation that results in a deficiency of the GPI anchor, leaving erythrocytes susceptible to complement-mediated hemolysis. The free Hb released during hemolysis in patients with PNH results in the depletion of serum nitric oxide and activation of the endothelial lining of the blood vessels, leading to vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation, and, consequently, venous thrombosis. Venous thrombosis is the leading cause of death in patients with PNH and usually occurs in atypical locations, such as portal veins, hepatic veins (resulting in Budd-Chiari syndrome), and cerebral veins (resulting in stroke).\nPatients with PNH who develop severe anemia, pain crises, venous thrombosis, and/or end-organ damage require anti-C5 antibody treatment, e.g., eculizumab, ravulizumab.

In hereditary TTP, deficiency of ADAMTS13 leads to the formation of large von Willebrand factor multimers that bind to endothelial cell surfaces. Platelets adhere to these multimers and microthrombi form, leading to thrombocytopenia and small-vessel occlusion. Circulating RBCs are damaged by the microthrombi blockages, resulting in MAHA. Further laboratory findings of TTP include a negative Coombs test, normal coagulation studies (e.g., PT, PTT), and other features of hemolytic anemia (e.g., increased indirect bilirubin, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin).\nFurther conditions associated with fragmented erythrocytes include disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, HELLP syndrome, and mechanical hemolysis (e.g., from mechanical heart valves).","bool":true},{"option":"Urinary red blood cell casts","explanation":"Urinary red blood cell casts indicate glomerular damage and can be seen in various conditions, such as glomerulonephritis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

A side effect of inhaled NO is the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+) at high levels, resulting in the formation of methemoglobin. Because Fe3+ has a reduced affinity for oxygen binding, methemoglobin is a poor oxygen transporter.

Since this reaction is also vitamin B12-dependent, a deficiency of either vitamin (e.g., from malnutrition due to alcohol use disorder) results in the accumulation of homocysteine. Hyperhomocysteinemia leads to hypercoagulability and is therefore associated with thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis. The underlying mechanisms include decreased endothelial antithrombotic activity and activation of procoagulatory factors (e.g., factor V, factor VII). A normal serum methylmalonic acid concentration, as seen here, indicates folate deficiency rather than vitamin B12 deficiency.\nIn addition to malnutrition, folate deficiency can also be caused by malabsorptive conditions (e.g., celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease), increased vitamin requirements (e.g., due to pregnancy), and certain drugs (e.g., methotrexate, phenytoin, trimethoprim).","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased protein C concentration","explanation":"\nProtein C inhibits the coagulation cascade by inactivating factor Va and factor VIIIa.

However, other findings, such as bone pain, symptoms of hypercalcemia, and foamy urine, would also be expected.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","explanation":"\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults, can occur spontaneously or secondary to numerous low-grade B-cell lymphomas (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Patients with DLBCL are of advanced age (&gt; 70 years) and present with a rapidly enlarging mass within the lymph system. However, B symptoms (weight loss, fever, night sweats) and painless lymphadenopathy would also be expected. In addition, DLBCL would not cause ringed sideroblasts and does not occur in association with myelodysplastic syndrome.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia","explanation":"\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) primarily occurs in older patients (&gt; 70 years) and could explain this patient's anemia. However, CLL more commonly manifests with a more insidious onset of B symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, and painless lymphadenopathy and is not associated with MDS. Predisposing factors include positive family history, advanced age, and exposure to organic solvents.

Although anemia can occur, other features such as hepatosplenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and leukemic dissemination would also be expected. More importantly, because mycosis fungoides is a cutaneous lymphoma, these findings would be preceded by intensely pruritic erythroderma accompanied by palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis. Atypical T cells would be present on peripheral blood smear instead of ringed sideroblasts.

The severity of alpha thalassemia is determined by the number of missing alleles. The absence of 3 alleles, as in this patient, indicates hemoglobin H disease (HbH disease), also referred to as alpha thalassemia intermedia (see “Overview of thalassemia” table). This condition is characterized by the presence of beta-globin tetramers, known as hemoglobin H (β4).\nDuring the first weeks of life, newborns express fetal gamma-globin rather than beta-globin. In newborns with HbH disease, the relative deficiency of alpha-globin chains causes the fetal gamma-globin chains to tetramerize and form hemoglobin Barts (γ4); in unaffected newborns, hemoglobin F (α2,γ2) would be produced instead. Although hemoglobin Barts can arise in any type of alpha thalassemia (e.g., it accounts for 3–8% of the total hemoglobin in alpha thalassemia minor), newborns with HbH disease usually have 20–40% hemoglobin Barts at birth; hemoglobin Barts is occasionally used as a newborn screening parameter for these conditions. Four to six weeks after birth, beta-globin levels become sufficiently high for hemoglobin H to form, which can be seen on electrophoresis. Further expected findings in HbH disease include an elevated RBC count and reticulocyte count; these features can be used to distinguish between HbH disease and other types of anemia, such as iron deficiency anemia.\nThe presence of hemoglobin Barts is most pronounced in the absence of all 4 alleles (i.e., hemoglobin Barts disease), which typically leads to hydrops fetalis.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased spherocyte count","explanation":"Increased spherocyte count is seen in patients with hereditary spherocytosis, which manifests with jaundice, splenomegaly, and pallor.

However, the symptoms of beta thalassemia major usually appear after 4–6 months, when most of the beta-globin production occurs. Moreover, the production of beta-globin is controlled by a single gene (i.e., only 2 alleles).

Although patients with vWD are often asymptomatic, possible manifestations include symptoms of platelet dysfunction (e.g., easy bruising, bleeding from mucosal surfaces) as vWF mediates platelet adhesion. In some cases, symptoms of disrupted secondary hemostasis (e.g., urinary, joint, and soft tissue bleeding) can occur since vWF prevents the breakdown of factor VIII. Around 50% of affected women with vWD have menorrhagia, as seen in this patient.

As a result, patients present with signs of folate deficiency (e.g., glossitis, dysphagia, elevated mean red cell volume, low reticulocyte count) and require folic acid supplementation.\nFolate deficiency is much more likely to develop in patients with chronic hemolysis before vitamin B12 deficiency because folate reserves in the body are not as large.","bool":true},{"option":"Cholecystectomy","explanation":"Patients with HS are more likely to develop cholelithiasis from bilirubin stones, which are due to hyperbilirubinemia from extravascular hemolysis.

The deficiency hinders the ability of platelets to adhere to subendothelial collagen and inhibits platelet activation, which leads to a prolonged bleeding time. PT and PTT are generally in normal ranges in patients with this condition because the clotting factors are unaffected. However, factor VIII is bound to vWF in the blood to prevent rapid breakdown. Thus, half of the patients with vWD can also present with mildly prolonged PTT, as seen in this patient.\nDesmopressin is the treatment of choice for vWD types 1 and 2 because it stimulates vWF release from endothelial cells.

In a patient with malignancy, normocytic anemia and normal red cell distribution width (RDW) suggest anemia of chronic disease.","answers":[{"option":"A","explanation":"\nAnemia of chronic disease (ACD) is caused by decreased erythropoiesis despite adequate iron stores. Chronic disease causes chronic inflammation with a consequent increase in hepcidin and cytokines (e.g., IL-6). These transmitters increase intracellular iron retention in macrophages and decrease intestinal iron absorption. As a result, serum iron levels and, consequently, transferrin saturation decrease. Transferrin, which is a negative inflammatory marker, can also be reduced in inflammation, indicated by a low total iron-binding capacity. Furthermore, the involved cytokines increase the transcription of acute phase reactant ferritin, resulting in high serum ferritin levels. Finally, these cytokines also inhibit erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, resulting in a low reticulocyte count. Expression of the transferrin receptor (TfR) is not affected in ACD and soluble TfR concentration remains normal.

The light chains cause eosinophilic intratubular cast formation and obstruction. They have a direct toxic effect on the renal tubular epithelial cells, resulting in tubular atrophy. A dipstick urine test cannot detect light chain proteins in the urine since it is specific for albumin.\nBesides myeloma cast nephropathy, renal disease in MM patients may be due to various other mechanisms, including AL amyloidosis (usually presenting with nephrotic syndrome due to glomerular dysfunction) or hypercalcemia (causing nephrocalcinosis).","bool":true},{"option":"Anti double-stranded DNA antibodies","explanation":"\nAnti-dsDNA antibodies are typically found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Cytochrome b5 reductase, an enzyme in erythrocytes, reduces methemoglobin (MetHb) back to hemoglobin (Hb). When compared to adults, infants have lower cytochrome b5 reductase activity, higher levels of fetal Hb (which is easily oxidized to MetHb), and consume more water per kilogram body weight; infants are therefore at higher risk of developing methemoglobinemia. Infants who receive home-prepared food or formula (e.g., during weaning) are at risk of nitrate poisoning. Nitrates are not concentrated in breast milk even if the mother is drinking water with a very high nitrate concentration; infants who are exclusively breastfed are, therefore, not at risk for developing nitrate poisoning.

The most important underlying mechanisms for this association are the low iron content of cow's milk and the inhibition of iron absorption caused by milk ingredients, especially calcium and casein. As IDA causes depletion of the body's iron stores, serum ferritin is decreased and TIBC is increased. Increased anisocytosis resulting in elevated RDW occurs because iron availability for RBC production varies throughout the day. The lack of iron also affects the final step of heme synthesis, which results in hypochromic (↓ MCH) and microcytic (↓ MCV) anemia as a result of disrupted RBC production (see “Serum laboratory findings in microcytic anemia” table).\nManagement of this patient should consist of oral iron supplementation as well as limiting the intake of cow's milk to 16–24 oz (470–710 mL) per day.","bool":true},{"option":"B","explanation":"The combination of normal MCV, normal RDW, low TIBC, and high ferritin is characteristic of anemia of chronic disease (ACD).

Her condition manifests in premature infants typically at the age of 3–12 weeks.","answers":[{"option":"Impaired erythropoietin production","explanation":"\nImpaired production of erythropoietin (EPO) is the primary cause of anemia of prematurity (AOP). EPO is produced by the fetal liver as well as fetal kidneys and production increases with gestational age. EPO levels and erythropoiesis show a physiological decrease after birth, as the onset of breathing and the closure of the ductus arteriosus increase tissue oxygenation. Preterm children are born with a lower hematocrit than full-term newborns, which is complicated by the physiologically reduced EPO production after birth. This effect results in AOP. Poor oxygen delivery to the tissue leads to clinical signs and symptoms of AOP (e.g., episodes of apnea). Laboratory findings for AOP include normocytic, normochromic anemia with a low-normal reticulocyte count, all of which are present in this patient.\nManagement of AOP includes limitation of blood withdrawals, iron supplementation (routinely done in preterm infants), and RBC transfusions if necessary (taking into account restrictive guidelines for transfusions in neonates).

In MM, cell proliferation increases the secretion of proosteoclastogenic factors (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1), which leads to osteolysis, and, consequently, hypercalcemia and diffuse bone pain. In addition, neoplastic cell infiltration in the bone marrow suppresses hematopoiesis, resulting in pancytopenia. Patients with MM also have an increased risk of infection due to the overproduction of nonfunctional antibodies.\nThis patient should undergo prompt evaluation for MM with serum and urine protein electrophoresis, a free light chain assay, and imaging to assess for bone lesions (e.g., whole-body low-dose CT scan). Bone marrow biopsy should also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased secretion of PTH from parathyroid chief cells","explanation":"Increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion indicates hyperparathyroidism, which, in combination with elevated calcium, suggests either primary hyperparathyroidism or, in rare cases, tertiary hyperparathyroidism. In both conditions, oversecretion of PTH increases calcium release from the bone and calcium reabsorption by the kidney, which may result in bone pain (e.g., hip pain) and signs of hypercalcemia (e.g., lethargy, confusion, vomiting). In addition, tertiary hyperparathyroidism can manifest with anemia and can be caused by longstanding chronic kidney disease, which manifests with elevated serum creatinine. However, a normal serum creatinine level 5 months prior makes tertiary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. In addition, primary hyperparathyroidism does not cause anemia, making another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Excessive intake of calcium","explanation":"Excessive intake of calcium, e.g., through excessive intake of dietary supplements, causes milk-alkali syndrome, which can manifest with symptoms of hypercalcemia. However, milk-alkali syndrome would not explain this patient's anemia or hip pain.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased excretion of calcium from renal tubular cells","explanation":"Chronic kidney injury (CKI), which manifests with elevated serum creatinine, can lead to decreased glomerular filtration (i.e., low filter load) and, subsequently, decreased excretion of calcium from renal tubular cells. However, in CKI, hypocalcemia rather than hypercalcemia is observed. In patients with CKI, hypocalcemia results from decreased renal hydroxylation of vitamin D, which reduces intestinal calcium absorption, and decreased renal excretion of phosphate, which causes hyperphosphatemia and subsequent calcium phosphate precipitation in tissues. The development of hypercalcemia, elevated serum creatinine, and anemia within the past 5 months makes this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased production of calcitriol","explanation":"Increased production of calcitriol (i.e., hypervitaminosis D) can cause increased intestinal calcium absorption and bone resorption, leading to hypercalcemia. Hypervitaminosis D can occur in patients with granulomatous diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis) or lymphoma secondary to increased expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase. Although lymphoma can cause anemia of chronic disease, this patient has no other characteristic symptoms (e.g., lymphadenopathy), and hip pain and increased serum creatinine levels are not typical features of lymphoma. In addition, this patient has no symptoms suggestive of granulomatous disease.","bool":false},{"option":"Release of PTH-related protein from malignant renal cells","explanation":"Release of PTH-related protein from malignant renal cells is a common cause of hypercalcemia in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). While RCC can cause bone pain (due to bone metastases or hypercalcemia) and anemia in addition to hypercalcemia, other features such as hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable flank mass would also be expected.

This condition would not prevent an increase of PTT because antibodies play no role in heparin's mechanism of action, so it is not a likely cause of this patient's symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperhomocysteinemia","explanation":"Elevated levels of homocysteine can be seen in patients with mutations in enzymes that metabolize homocysteine (autosomal recessive), vitamin B12 deficiency, and vitamin B6 deficiency. Hyperhomocysteinemia is considered a risk factor for thrombosis as it alters the function of thrombomodulin, factor VII, and factor V. Excess homocysteine also damages the vasculature leading to decreased endothelial antithrombotic activity. However, this patient has no evidence of anemia due to vitamin B6 or B12 deficiency (fatigue, pallor, tachycardia) or a family history of metabolic disease (enzyme deficiency). Moreover, homocysteine plays no role in heparin's mechanism of action and, therefore, does not affect the efficacy of heparin.","bool":false},{"option":"Factor V Leiden","explanation":"The altered factor V in Factor V Leiden is immune to the regulatory effect of protein C. Overactivity of factor V results in excessive activation of prothrombin, leading to a hypercoagulable state. Because neither protein C nor factor V interacts with heparin, its efficacy is unaffected in patients with Factor V Leiden.","bool":false},{"option":"Antithrombin III deficiency","explanation":"\nAntithrombin III deficiency (AT III deficiency) is an inherited autosomal dominant hypercoagulable disease. AT III inhibits coagulation by binding to and inactivating the coagulation factors II (thrombin) and X. Heparin works by potentiating the binding of AT III to thrombin and factor X. This patient's PTT remains normal despite heparin administration because heparin requires AT III to achieve its effect. Patients with AT III deficiency can tolerate higher doses of heparin (also known as heparin resistance) without showing any changes in PTT.

The combination of IDA and unintentional weight loss in a 63-year-old patient raises concern for chronic gastrointestinal bleeding from colorectal cancer (CRC). A stool guaiac test, which can detect the presence of occult blood in the stool, is likely to be positive. Following a stool guaiac test, this patient should undergo further diagnostic studies (e.g., colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy) in order to confirm the underlying source of bleeding.\nIDA from chronic occult blood loss in the absence of obstructive symptoms is especially common in patients with right-sided colon carcinoma.

Important risk factors for the development of vitamin B12 deficiency include malnutrition (e.g., in veganism or restricted dietary intake due to anorexia nervosa), inflammatory bowel disease, and bariatric surgery. Patients with this condition may present with a variety of symptoms, including glossitis, neurological symptoms (e.g., diminished executive functioning and personality changes), and gait abnormalities (due to peripheral neuropathy or subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord), none of which are seen here. Furthermore, vitamin B12 deficiency is not typically associated with unintentional weight loss or pica.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated serum lead concentration","explanation":"Elevated serum lead concentration is caused by the consumption of substances contaminated with lead (e.g., due to pica).

This leads to von Willebrand factor accumulation on endothelial cell surfaces, platelet adhesion, and microthrombosis with fragmentation of red blood cells (schistocytes on peripheral blood smear) and end-organ ischemia and damage, especially in the brain and in the kidneys. Severely decreased activity of ADAMTS13 in serum confirms the diagnosis of TTP in a patient with otherwise unexplained microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. However, ADAMTS13 measurement is not routinely available, and, therefore, waiting for test results to confirm ADAMTS13 deficiency should not delay treatment. Treatment with plasma exchange should be started promptly after a presumptive diagnosis is made based on clinical features and initial laboratory results.\nIn approx. 95% of individuals affected by TTP, the condition is acquired and results from anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. Risk factors include drugs (chemotherapeutic agents, ticlopidine, clopidogrel), pregnancy, and systemic diseases such as HIV, systemic lupus erythematosus, and malignancies. Congenital TTP, which is due to mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene, often presents in infancy or childhood.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy","explanation":"Decreased megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy would indicate decreased production of platelets, e.g., due to aplastic anemia or bone marrow infiltration. In patients with TTP, bone marrow biopsy is not routinely indicated. If done, it would show normal or increased megakaryocytes because the thrombocytopenia seen in these patients is a result of peripheral consumption rather than decreased production of platelets.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated fibrin degradation products in serum","explanation":"Elevated fibrin degradation products are seen in disorders of the coagulation cascade such as disseminated intravascular coagulation and are a result of fibrin breakdown by plasmin, which creates D-dimers.

GMP is used to create viral RNA; therefore, decreased GMP synthesis leads to impaired HCV replication. In addition, ribavirin also binds to the nucleotide-binding site of RNA polymerase, thereby further inhibiting viral replication. Ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia results from the accumulation of phosphorylated forms of ribavirin within red blood cells; since RBCs lack dephosphorylating enzymes, ribavirin accumulates within cells, leading to hemolysis.

Extramedullary hematopoiesis often occurs as a compensatory mechanism in patients with chronic anemia and commonly involves the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes and can also affect the bones (e.g., skull) and paravertebral areas, causing spinal cord compression, which can lead to lower extremity weakness, hyperreflexia, and decreased sensation below the level of compression. Extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and liver is physiological during fetal development but is always pathological after birth.","bool":true},{"option":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis","explanation":"\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis can cause splenomegaly and bone marrow infiltration. However, extramedullary hematopoiesis is rare in Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and histopathology of a biopsy sample would typically reveal polygonal cells with coffee bean-shaped nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm (i.e., Langerhans cell proliferation) rather than erythroid colonies with an abundance of megakaryocytes and myeloid cells.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute myeloid leukemia","explanation":"\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) can develop secondary to a myelodysplastic syndrome and can manifest with extramedullary hematopoiesis and splenomegaly.

Laboratory results confirm the diagnosis of normocytic, normochromic anemia.","answers":[{"option":"Decreased erythropoietin production","explanation":"This patient's normocytic anemia is most likely due to her underlying CKD. The etiology of anemia of chronic kidney disease is multifactorial, but primarily driven by low erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is produced and released by the interstitial cells in the peritubular capillaries and stimulates erythroid proliferation in the bone marrow. In CKD, there is decreased production of erythropoietin, leading to a decrease in RBC proliferation, and subsequent normocytic anemia with a low reticulocyte count (hypoproliferative anemia). CKD may also manifest with iron deficiency, however, this patient's normal ferritin levels indicate normal iron stores.","bool":true},{"option":"Chronic occult blood loss","explanation":"Chronic occult gastrointestinal blood loss is the most common cause of anemia in older individuals.

This is a tough question designed to test your understanding of multiple biochemical pathways. Nucleotides are synthesized using ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), which is primarily produced as an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. The oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate by G6PD is the rate-limiting step of the pentose phosphate pathway. In patients with G6PD deficiency, R5P is produced by the enzymes transketolase and transaldolase. This occurs in the nonoxidative (reversible) branch of the pentose phosphate pathway using byproducts of glycolysis, namely, fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P). Therefore, transketolase is one of the essential enzymes for the production of R5P, and thus nucleotide synthesis, in patients with G6PD deficiency.\nWhen the cellular need for R5P is low, transketolase and transaldolase function in reverse to create F6P and GA3P for ATP generation.","bool":true},{"option":"Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I","explanation":"Unlike carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step for de novo pyrimidine synthesis, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I does not contribute to nucleotide synthesis. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, the rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle, catalyzes the production of carbamoyl phosphate by combining ammonia and bicarbonate.

Individuals with CKD are at increased risk of bleeding and anemia.","answers":[{"option":"Dysfunctional platelet aggregation","explanation":"The gastrointestinal bleeding in this patient with CKD and uremia is most likely secondary to uremic platelet dysfunction. Abnormal platelet adhesion and platelet aggregation in individuals with uremia are multifactorial and most likely occur because of the presence of platelet function inhibitors, uremic toxins, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa dysfunction. Abnormalities in von Willebrand factor and thrombocytopenia may also play a role in increased bleeding tendency in patients with CKD.

However, because this patient lacks the aforementioned features and is afebrile, well-appearing, and has small, mobile lymph nodes with a preceding viral illness, a lymph node biopsy is not indicated at this time.","bool":false},{"option":"Obtain throat swabs","explanation":"Throat swabbing for a rapid antigen test or bacterial culture is performed to confirm group A streptococcus (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis. Throat swabs should not be performed without strong clinical suspicion of GAS infection because GAS often colonizes the oropharynx without causing any infection. In a child presenting with acute BCL, throat swabs are unnecessary if there is a history of recent cough and coryza; the presence of both makes a viral URTI likely and GAS extremely unlikely. In children with acute BCL and no history of viral URTI symptoms, a throat swab is performed if any of the following features are present: concomitant fever &gt; 38°C, tonsillar swelling, pharyngeal or tonsillar exudates, evidence of suppurative lymphadenitis (e.g., severe tenderness, fluctuating swelling). Mild pharyngeal erythema and slight lymph node tenderness are common with viral URTIs and these findings alone are not indications for performing a throat swab.","bool":false},{"option":"Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy","explanation":"\nEmpiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated in patients with acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis (UCL) and moderate symptoms (e.g., warm, tender adenitis, fever).

Although this patient recently started playing flag football, there is no evidence of excessive training. Furthermore, stress fractures involving the hip are very rare.","bool":false},{"option":"Avascular necrosis","explanation":"\nAvascular osteonecrosis of the femoral head can be a complication of SCD and typically manifests between 7–15 years of age. Osteonecrosis is caused by trabecular bone infarction from RBC sickling and vaso-occlusion. The femoral head is commonly affected because of poor collateral blood supply. In a patient with SCD, subacute hip pain without systemic symptoms is characteristic of avascular osteonecrosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Septic arthritis","explanation":"Although septic arthritis can be a complication of SCD (due to functional asplenia) and lead to hip pain in children, it is usually accompanied by systemic (e.g., fever, chills, leukocytosis) and local findings (joint swelling, erythema). This patient's isolated hip pain is more likely the result of a different complication of SCD.","bool":false},{"option":"Slipped capital femoral epiphysis","explanation":"\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a common hip disorder in adolescents and affects boys more often than girls.

Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Easy bruising, thrombophlebitis, and symptoms of microvascular disturbance (e.g., lightheadedness, intermittent headaches) in a patient with a dramatically elevated platelet count are suggestive of essential thrombocythemia (ET). The drug used as a cytoreductive agent in patients with ET is hydroxyurea.","answers":[{"option":"Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin","explanation":"\nFetal hemoglobin (HbF) does not contain β-globin chains, the mutated component in sickle cell anemia hemoglobin (HbS). Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin by altering the genetic expression of β-globin chains, with γ-globin chains being produced instead (i.e., HbF created in place of HbS or HbA). This leads to a proportional reduction in sickled hemoglobin, thus decreasing RBC polymerization (HbF does not polymerize) and sickling. Therefore, the number of hemolytic and vaso-occlusive episodes decreases.\nHydroxyurea also has a cytoreductive action, blocking DNA synthesis and cell division by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase. This makes it a potent antimetabolite and a useful drug in the treatment of myeloproliferative diseases, as this patient has.","bool":true},{"option":"Augmentation of red blood cell production","explanation":"Augmentation of red blood cell production is the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). This reduces the severity of anemia and need for transfusions in individuals with chronic kidney disease, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and anemia of myelodysplastic syndromes. However, this patient presents with essential thrombocythemia, a myeloproliferative disease that would benefit from treatment with a cytoreductive agent (e.g., an antimetabolite), not an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. In addition, rhEPO is not preferred in the treatment of sickle cell anemia, as it does not prevent hemolysis or vaso-occlusive crises.","bool":false},{"option":"Restoration of the body's iron stores","explanation":"Restoration of the body's iron stores is achieved by either oral or parenteral administration of iron. Individuals with sickle cell anemia can develop iron deficiency secondary to hemolysis and urinary loss of iron. However, iron supplementation is not routinely given to adults with sickle cell anemia, as there is evidence that iron-deficient RBCs are less prone to sickling. (Iron supplementation is, however, recommended for iron-deficient children with sickle cell anemia.) This patient was diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia, a myeloproliferative disorder of platelets that is not treated with iron supplementation.","bool":false},{"option":"Substitution of cofactors for DNA synthesis","explanation":"Substitution of cofactors for DNA synthesis (i.e., Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid) is the primary treatment for megaloblastic anemia. Essential thrombocythemia, which this patient has, is caused by excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes, not ineffective DNA synthesis of erythrocyte precursors. Therefore, vitamin B12 and folic acid are not administered as therapy. In individuals with sickle cell anemia, vitamin B12 and folic acid may be supplemented to support the increased erythropoiesis following a hemolytic crisis. However, they play no role in preventing sickling of RBCs or vaso-occlusive crises.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation","explanation":"Inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation is the effect of antiplatelet agents. Aspirin, a cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor, is used to prevent thrombotic events in essential thrombocythemia, which this patient has. However, antiplatelet agents play no role in preventing hemolysis or vaso-occlusive crises in individuals with sickle cell anemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of stem cell differentiation","explanation":"Inhibition of stem cell differentiation into megakaryocytes is the mechanism of action of IFN-α, a treatment option for essential thrombocythemia, which this patient has. However, as sickle cell anemia is a genetic mutation affecting hemoglobin, not megakaryocytes, IFN-α would not be beneficial in its management.","bool":false},{"option":"Prevention of hemoglobin S polymerization","explanation":"Drugs that prevent hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerization are still under investigation and could be the future mainstay of treatment for sickle cell disease.

However, while penetrating abdominal trauma (e.g., gunshot, knife wound) leads to immediate bowel injury and intestinal leakage, blunt abdominal trauma (e.g., this patient's fall) typically results in an intestinal contusion, which slowly develops into necrosis and intestinal rupture after several days. This patient's acute presentation after a fall makes another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Liver hematoma","explanation":"Abdominal pain radiating to the shoulder and abdominal guarding after a fall may raise suspicion for liver hematoma.

The presence of large VWF molecules in patients with TTP causes increased platelet adhesion and aggregation, resulting in microthrombi formation and consumption of platelets. This process leads to thrombocytopenia with bleeding manifestations (e.g., petechiae, bleeding gums), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (↓ hemoglobin, ↑ LDH, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, schistocytes, jaundice), neurologic abnormalities (e.g., headache, dizziness), fever, and renal involvement (↑ creatinine, proteinuria). Pregnancy is a known risk factor for TTP.

Clinically, this manifests as headache, altered mental status, tachycardia, flushed skin, and almond-scented breath. Nitrites oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin, which binds cyanide, thereby allowing oxidative phosphorylation to resume and symptoms to improve.

Schistocytes together with his murmur and family history of bicuspid aortic valve make mechanical hemolysis (i.e., fragmentation of erythrocytes) secondary to aortic stenosis the most likely cause of this patient's condition. In most cases, bicuspid aortic valve is a hereditary disease, and it is associated with premature aortic stenosis. Fragmentation hemolysis secondary to aortic valve stenosis is thought to result from high-velocity turbulence occurring near the valve. Bicuspid aortic valve is typically an indication for valve replacement.\nThe presence of schistocytes should always raise concern for TTP, DIC, and HELLP syndrome, all of which require prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent further complications.

While all of these conditions can present with a dramatically increased platelet count, patients with PV have marked erythrocytosis (↑ hemoglobin), and PMF typically manifests with splenomegaly, neither of which is the case here. ET is therefore the most likely diagnosis in this patient. Patients with ET are at risk of thromboembolic complications (DVT, thrombophlebitis) and some female patients experience spontaneous miscarriages. Other common features include easy bruising and petechial bleeding (due to dysfunctional platelets).\nSince ET may be asymptomatic, it is often discovered incidentally when a blood count shows prominent thrombocytosis.

In this condition, RBCs are especially sensitive to destruction by complement complexes, which causes intravascular hemolysis (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LDH), manifesting with jaundice and hemoglobinuria (dark urine). Complements also destroy leukocytes and thrombocytes, causing pancytopenia. Due to RBC destruction, less nitric oxide is generated by RBCs, and the remaining NO is scavenged by free hemoglobin (a result of hemolysis). NO is a vasodilator that causes muscle relaxation and inhibits platelet aggregation.

Though this patient presents with fever and fatigue, the lack of pharyngitis, marked lymphocytosis (50,000/mm3), as well as the considerable anemia and thrombocytopenia, make this diagnosis less likely. Similarly, the physical exam shows nontender lymph nodes; infections typically lead to tender enlargement of the lymph nodes.

Although this patient has a history of recurrent infections during childhood, he does not have the typical features of Chediak-Higashi syndrome, e.g., albinism, photosensitivity, bleeding tendency, and peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, the occurrence of an anaphylactic reaction to blood transfusion is not explained by Chediak-Higashi syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Absence of mature circulating B cells","explanation":"The absence of mature circulating B cells is the pathophysiologic mechanism of X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Infants with X-linked agammaglobulinemia are initially asymptomatic because of maternal IgG in their serum, but these molecules are no longer present by the age of 6 months. At this age, the first onset of severe, recurring infections is commonly seen. Without lifelong administration of gamma globulins and prophylactic antibiotics, the condition is most often lethal in childhood.

The development of hypercalcemia, anemia, renal dysfunction (as indicated by the increased serum creatinine concentration), elevated ESR, and bone pain (lower back pain) over a relatively short time (laboratory studies were normal 3 months ago) raises concern for a malignant etiology.","answers":[{"option":"Release of osteoclast activating factors from malignant plasma cells","explanation":"This patient's presentation (i.e., hypercalcemia, anemia, elevated serum creatinine, and lower back pain) indicates multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by overproliferation and diffuse infiltration of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. In MM, plasma cell proliferation increases the secretion of proosteoclastogenic factors (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1, RANKL) which leads to osteolysis, and, consequently, hypercalcemia and diffuse bone pain. In addition, neoplastic plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow suppresses hematopoiesis, resulting in pancytopenia. Kidney injury in patients with MM is usually the result of deposition of light chain cast nephropathy (myeloma kidney) and hypercalcemia. The excess production of monoclonal protein by malignant plasma cells leads to increased serum viscosity and, consequently, elevated ESR. Patients with MM also have an increased risk of infection due to the overproduction of nonfunctional antibodies.","bool":true},{"option":"Excess PTH secretion from parathyroid glands","explanation":"Increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion indicates hyperparathyroidism, which, in combination with elevated calcium, suggests either primary hyperparathyroidism or, in rare cases, tertiary hyperparathyroidism. In both conditions, oversecretion of PTH increases calcium release from the bone and calcium reabsorption by the kidney, which may result in bone pain (e.g., lower back pain) and signs of hypercalcemia. In addition, tertiary hyperparathyroidism can manifest with anemia and can be caused by longstanding chronic kidney disease, which manifests with elevated serum creatinine. However, a normal serum creatinine level 3 months prior makes tertiary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. In addition, primary hyperparathyroidism does not cause anemia or elevated ESR, making another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased renal excretion of calcium","explanation":"Chronic kidney injury (CKI), which manifests with elevated serum creatinine, can lead to decreased glomerular filtration (i.e., low filter load) and, subsequently, decreased excretion of calcium from renal tubular cells. However, in CKI, hypocalcemia rather than hypercalcemia is observed. In patients with CKI, hypocalcemia results from decreased renal hydroxylation of vitamin D, which reduces intestinal calcium absorption, and decreased renal excretion of phosphate, which causes hyperphosphatemia and subsequent calcium phosphate precipitation in tissues. The development of hypercalcemia, elevated serum creatinine, elevated ESR, and anemia within only 3 months makes this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased production of calcitriol","explanation":"Increased production of calcitriol (i.e., hypervitaminosis D) can cause increased intestinal calcium absorption and bone resorption, leading to hypercalcemia. Hypervitaminosis D can occur in patients with granulomatous diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis) or lymphoma secondary to increased expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase. Although lymphoma can cause anemia of chronic disease, this patient has no other characteristic symptoms (e.g., lymphadenopathy), and hip pain and increased serum creatinine levels are not typical features of lymphoma. In addition, this patient has no symptoms suggestive of granulomatous disease.","bool":false},{"option":"Release of PTH-related protein from malignant renal cells","explanation":"Release of PTH-related protein from malignant renal cells is a common cause of hypercalcemia in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

However, patients with TRALI or TACO would present with hypoxemia as a result of respiratory insufficiency and bilateral crackles due to pulmonary edema. Moreover, patients with TACO are usually afebrile and hypertensive rather than hypotensive, given their state of circulatory overload. Together with the normal SpO2, the absence of these findings makes these diagnoses unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Serum antibodies against Class I HLA antigens","explanation":"Serum antibodies directed against donor HLA antigens have been associated with febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs), as the antibodies may bind to HLA antigens on residual donor leukocytes in blood products and possibly stimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines, which could cause fever and tachypnea.

As gram-positive organisms (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci) are the most common pathogens that cause CRBSI, gram-positive antibiotic coverage is warranted for all patients with CRBSI; vancomycin is usually recommended because of the high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in health care settings. Compared to subclavian and jugular CRBSI, there is a higher risk of CRBSI caused by Candida spp. or gram-negative bacilli in femoral CRBSI due to the risk of colonization in this region. Therefore, gram-negative coverage (including for Pseudomonas aeruginosa) with a fourth-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefepime) or a carbapenem as well as Candida spp. coverage with an echinocandin (e.g., caspofungin) is indicated. In patients with subclavian and jugular CRBSI, vancomycin alone is the most appropriate empiric therapy (see “Empiric antibiotic therapy for CRBSI” table).\nCatheter removal is warranted in patients with sepsis and hemodynamic instability (such as this patient), endocarditis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, or persistent bacteremia despite &gt; 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy against the causative pathogen.

An MRI scan of the brain shows signs of an evolving cerebral infarction on the patient's left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?","difficulty":4,"hint":"In a young patient, ischemic stroke, a history of dactylitis (pain/swelling of the hands and feet), and low O2 saturation suggest sickle cell disease (SCD). Sickled red blood cells are rigid and tend to clump along the walls of arteries, which can lead to thrombosis, infarction, and end-organ ischemia (cerebral infarction in this case).","answers":[{"option":"Exchange transfusion therapy","explanation":"\nImmediate exchange transfusion is the first-line therapy in SCD patients with an acute ischemic stroke. During exchange transfusion, erythrocytes with HbS are removed and exchanged with HbS-free erythrocytes, reducing both the concentration of HbS and the rate of vasoocclusion, as well as increasing oxygen delivery. Although exchange transfusion improves outcomes, it does not reverse pre-existing vasoocclusion. In this patient, supplemental oxygen should also be administered to maintain a saturation above 95%.\nPrevention of stroke in children with SCD includes screening with transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Identified high-risk patients, as well as children who have already had an ischemic stroke, should receive chronic blood transfusions to lower the proportion of HbS.","bool":true},{"option":"Hydroxyurea therapy","explanation":"\nHydroxyurea therapy is considered a first-line treatment for primary prevention of vasoocclusive crises and is used in the management of anemia in SCD. As it functions primarily by raising fetal hemoglobin levels, which can take several months to increase significantly, hydroxyurea would not be helpful in the management of an acute ischemic stroke. However, this patient should be started on hydroxyurea before leaving the hospital, as it has been proven to improve survival outcomes and reduce complications.","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator therapy","explanation":"Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is indicated for acute ischemic stroke in patients who have had an occlusive episode within the past 4.5 hours. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the clumping of sickled red blood cells rather than the thrombi that cause most ischemic strokes, for which tPA therapy is not effective. In addition, this patient is only 5 years of age and tPA is not FDA-approved for the treatment of stroke in individuals &lt; 18 years of age. A different therapy with a rapid effect that allows for the precise control of HbS levels is more appropriate.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Mechanical thrombectomy","explanation":"\nMechanical thrombectomy is usually reserved for patients with a proximal large artery occlusion in the anterior cerebral circulation. It is typically carried out in conjunction with intravenous thrombolytic therapy. This technique would not be appropriate in a young patient with SCD.","bool":false},{"option":"Aspirin therapy","explanation":"\nAspirin therapy, which has an antiplatelet effect, is a common adjunctive therapy in the management of an acute ischemic stroke, including in patients with SCD. Administration within 24–48 hours of symptom onset reduces the risk of recurrent stroke and improves mortality. However, another option is more appropriate for the acute management of this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Heparin therapy","explanation":"Although patients with SCD are considered hypercoagulable at baseline, anticoagulation is not recommended for patients with SCD with an acute ischemic stroke. In fact, the use of anticoagulants is strongly cautioned in all patients with SCD, as these patients are at greater risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Heparin is only indicated as thromboprophylactic therapy in patients with SCD ≥ 18 years of age that are hospitalized with an acute medical illness.","bool":false}]},{"id":288,"info":"Blood and Lymphoreticular System","question":"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a severely itchy rash. She initially noticed a small, itchy bump that gradually became a generalized rash. She reports that the itching is extremely bothersome and often wakes her up at night. Yesterday, she also noticed a lump in the left axilla. She has used over-the-counter emollients to decrease the intensity of the rash, but they have not had any notable effect. She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. She has osteoarthritis of the knees, for which she takes daily ibuprofen. Examination shows diffuse erythroderma with fine scales involving the neck, shoulders, back, abdomen, and extremities. The nails appear normal. There is generalized lymphadenopathy. A peripheral blood smear shows numerous atypical cells with highly grooved nuclei. This patient's condition is most likely caused by abnormal proliferation of which of the following types of cells?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Diffuse erythroderma with intense pruritus, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a peripheral blood smear that shows numerous atypical cells with highly grooved (cerebriform) nuclei are consistent with a diagnosis of Sézary syndrome (SS).","answers":[{"option":"T cells","explanation":"SS is a subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) characterized by leukemic dissemination of malignant T cells in the skin. This condition can evolve from mycosis fungoides (another CTCL subtype) or arise de novo. The evaluation of SS should include a skin biopsy to assess cell morphology, immunophenotype, and clonality as well as a peripheral blood smear with flow cytometry and clonality studies. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Sézary cells (atypical T cells with cerebriform nuclei) in the peripheral blood. Treatments include skin-directed therapies (e.g., topical corticosteroids, topical nitrogen mustards) and systemic therapies (e.g., phototherapy, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies).","bool":true},{"option":"Keratinocytes","explanation":"Abnormal proliferation of keratinocytes does not occur in SS, but in several dermatologic conditions, including psoriasis and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Psoriasis typically manifests with well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silver-white scales on the scalp, back, and extensor surfaces. Erythroderma is an uncommon manifestation of psoriasis. Nonmelanoma skin cancers manifest with discrete lesions, most commonly in sun-exposed areas of skin; they do not cause erythroderma. In addition, these conditions do not manifest with generalized lymphadenopathy or atypical cells with highly grooved (cerebriform) nuclei on a peripheral blood smear.","bool":false},{"option":"Plasma cells","explanation":"Abnormal proliferation of plasma cells occurs in plasma cell dyscrasias, such as multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma can rarely manifest with cutaneous plasmacytomas, which typically appear as purple-red, subcutaneous nodules, but it does not cause erythroderma. In addition, multiple myeloma does not typically cause generalized lymphadenopathy or pruritus. SS, which this patient has, is not caused by abnormal proliferation of plasma cells.","bool":false},{"option":"B cells","explanation":"Abnormal proliferation of B cells occurs in B-cell lymphomas. These malignancies can be further categorized into Hodgkin lymphomas, which are characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, which comprise all other types. Patients with B-cell lymphomas typically develop localized lymphadenopathy (not generalized) and have B symptoms, which are not seen in this patient. In addition, B-cell lymphomas do not cause erythroderma. SS, which this patient has, is not caused by abnormal proliferation of B cells.","bool":false},{"option":"Myeloblasts","explanation":"Abnormal proliferation of myeloblasts occurs in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which can rarely manifest with generalized lymphadenopathy and pruritus. AML can also cause cutaneous lesions (leukemia cutis). However, leukemia cutis typically manifests with discrete, nodular lesions; it does not cause erythroderma. In addition, myeloblasts on peripheral blood smear appear as immature cells with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli and may show Auer rods; they do not have highly grooved (cerebriform) nuclei. SS, which this patient has, is not caused by abnormal proliferation of myeloblasts.","bool":false}]},{"id":289,"info":"Blood and Lymphoreticular System","question":"A 21-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia comes to the physician because she has not had a menstrual period for 12 months. Menarche occurred at the age of 11 years, and menses occurred at regular 28-day intervals until they became irregular 1 year ago. Physical examination shows normal female genitalia and bimanual examination shows a normal-sized uterus. Laboratory studies show markedly elevated FSH levels consistent with premature ovarian failure. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies show a 46,XY karyotype in the peripheral blood cells. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the male karyotype found on chromosomal analysis?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has secondary amenorrhea due to premature ovarian failure, most likely related to chemotherapy she received in the past. Physical examination shows a female phenotype, whereas chromosomal analysis shows a male genotype.","answers":[{"option":"Allogeneic bone marrow transplant","explanation":"\nAllogeneic stem cell transplantation is used in post-remission therapy of patients with ALL who have a high risk of relapse. In contrast to autologous stem cell transplantation, which involves the removal, storage, and retransfusion of a patient's own cells, allogenous stem cell transplantation refers to the administration of hematopoietic stem cells from a sibling or unrelated donor. Chromosomal analysis in this female patient shows a male genotype (46,XY karyotype) because she received stem cells from a male donor (e.g., sex-mismatched transplantation). This patient's premature ovarian failure is most likely related to cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and radiation administered prior to the allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\nOther types of grafts include isografts (e.g., from an identical twin) and xenografts (e.g., from a pig).\n","bool":true},{"option":"21-hydroxylase deficiency","explanation":"\n21-hydroxylase deficiency is seen in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a group of autosomal recessive defects in the enzymes responsible for cortisol, aldosterone, and androgen synthesis. In contrast to this patient, 21-hydroxylase deficiency in women most commonly manifests with hypotension, virilization, and precocious puberty. Although menstrual irregularities can occur in CAH, the mechanism differs from premature ovarian failure. It would not explain the male genotype seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Defective androgen receptor","explanation":"Defective androgen receptor function is the underlying cause of androgen insensitivity syndrome, an X-linked recessive mutation of the gene locus encoding the androgen receptor. Patients present with amenorrhea, variable degrees of feminization, and a 46,XY karyotype. However, a blind vaginal pouch, uterine agenesis, and primary amenorrhea (rather than secondary amenorrhea) would also be expected. ","bool":false},{"option":"Müllerian duct agenesis","explanation":"\nMüllerian duct agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome) is a rare, congenital defect that manifests with normally functioning gonads, female phenotype, and primary amenorrhea due to a missing or abnormal uterus. In contrast to this patient, premature ovarian failure and male genotype on FISH analysis would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Radiation therapy","explanation":"Radiation is used as CNS preventive therapy in patients with ALL, and it has been associated with amenorrhea and premature ovarian failure due to cytotoxic effects on oocytes. However, radiotherapy of the CNS would not cause a male genotype on FISH, which is seen in this patient.","bool":false}]},{"id":290,"info":"Blood and Lymphoreticular System","question":"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 12-hour history of abdominal pain and dark urine. Three days ago, he developed a cough, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. Examination shows conjunctival pallor, scleral icterus, and mild splenomegaly. A peripheral blood smear shows small round inclusions within erythrocytes and several erythrocytes with semicircular indentations. The underlying cause of this patient's condition is most likely to also affect which of the following processes?","difficulty":4,"hint":"Heinz bodies (inclusions of denatured hemoglobin within erythrocytes) and bite cells are characteristic of glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency). The patient's abdominal pain, dark urine, conjunctival pallor, scleral icterus, and splenomegaly suggest acute hemolytic crisis. This is a common manifestation of G6PD deficiency, which is typically triggered by exposure to oxidative conditions (e.g., drugs, infections, or fava beans).","answers":[{"option":"Generation of superoxide","explanation":"\nGeneration of superoxide is the first step of respiratory burst, a cellular pathway that creates reactive oxygen species to degrade phagocytized pathogens. This step requires NADPH, which is produced by the enzyme G6PD as part of the hexose monophosphate shunt. G6PD deficiency therefore results in a deficiency of NADPH and failure of superoxide generation in respiratory burst. NADPH is involved in numerous cellular processes, including protection against reactive oxygen species toxicity, regeneration of glutathione, and lipid synthesis.\nIn severe cases, NADPH deficiency can cause complete dysfunction of phagolysosomal digestion, resulting in symptoms of chronic granulomatous disease.","bool":true},{"option":"Anchoring proteins to cell surface","explanation":"Anchoring proteins to the cell surface is a function performed by molecules such as phosphatidylinositol. This function is impaired in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Both PNH and G6PD deficiency manifest with hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinuria. However, a blood smear of a patient with PNH would not show Heinz bodies. Furthermore, PNH is usually associated with other findings, such as excessive fatigue and venous thrombosis in unusual locations.","bool":false},{"option":"De-novo synthesis of glutathione","explanation":"De-novo synthesis of glutathione is performed by the enzyme glutathione synthetase. Much like G6PD deficiency, a deficiency in glutathione synthesis can cause hemolytic anemia. Although NADPH produced by G6PD is required as a cofactor for the reduction of oxidized glutathione, G6PD is not involved in the de-novo synthesis of glutathione.","bool":false},{"option":"Function of myeloperoxidase","explanation":"\nMyeloperoxidase is a neutrophilic enzyme involved in the oxidative burst. It catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into hypochlorous acid, which is then used by phagocytes to destroy engulfed microbes. In myeloperoxidase deficiency, this enzymatic reaction is impaired, leading to increased susceptibility to infection with Candida spp. The function of myeloperoxidase is not affected by G6PD deficiency.","bool":false},{"option":"Conversion of phosphoenolypyruvate","explanation":"Conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate is the final step in glycolysis. Like G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency causes intrinsic hemolytic anemia. However, the two enzymes operate independently and G6PD deficiency does not affect pyruvate kinase function. Furthermore, blood smear or pyruvate kinase deficiency shows burr cells instead of Heinz bodies, and patients are more likely to have chronic features of anemia compared to patients with G6PD deficiency who have recurrent episodes of anemia.","bool":false}]},{"id":291,"info":"Blood and Lymphoreticular System","question":"\nTwo days after admission to the hospital for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, a 35-year-old man develops nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps.

In combination with the laboratory findings (↑ potassium, ↑ urea nitrogen, ↑ uric acid, ↑ phosphorus, ↓ calcium), his presentation indicates tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).","answers":[{"option":"Intravenous hydration","explanation":"\nIntravenous hydration is recommended for all patients at risk of developing TLS. Patients receiving cytotoxic treatment for hematological malignancies with high cell turnover (e.g., leukemias or lymphomas) are especially at risk of developing TLS as a result of rapid cell lysis. The condition is characterized by the massive release of intracellular components, such as potassium, phosphate, and uric acid, into the blood, which can cause acute urate nephropathy leading to acute kidney failure and death. Adequate hydration prior to receiving chemotherapy helps minimize kidney injury and symptoms.\nElectrolyte abnormalities in TLS can lead to seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.","bool":true},{"option":"Allopurinol","explanation":"\nAllopurinol is a hypouricemic drug that is used as an adjunctive measure for the prevention of urate nephropathy, which usually can occur as a sequela of TLS. Although this drug is useful in the management of this complication because it decreases uric acid formation, it is not the most effective preventive measure for TLS.","bool":false},{"option":"Rasburicase","explanation":"\nRasburicase, a urate oxidase recombinant, is a drug that helps degrade uric acid, catalyzing it to a more soluble compound (allantoin).
