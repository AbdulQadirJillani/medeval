The change in urine osmolality after desmopressin administration can be used to identify the cause of DI.","answers":[{"option":"Posterior pituitary","explanation":"\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH) is produced in the hypothalamus (supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus). This hormone is then stored in, and subsequently released by, the posterior pituitary gland. Ischemia or direct damage (e.g., major surgery or head trauma) to the pituitary gland can affect ADH secretion and cause transient central DI. Features of central DI include polyuria, polydipsia, and increased serum osmolality in the presence of low urine osmolality. In the majority of cases, patients recover the ability to maintain serum osmolality, and ADH secretion is restored.","bool":true},{"option":"Supraoptic nucleus","explanation":"The supraoptic nucleus produces ADH. Damage to this nucleus leads to central DI, which can manifest with thirst, polyuria, and hypernatremia as seen in this patient. However, because the majority of ADH is produced in the supraoptic nucleus, damage to this structure typically leads to permanent DI, not a quick recovery (transient DI) like the one seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Adrenal cortex","explanation":"The adrenal cortex produces glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur in the postoperative period (Addisonian crisis) because of ischemic adrenal damage. Furthermore, acute adrenal insufficiency can be transient, as seen here.

The most common type of pituitary adenomas is a prolactinoma.","answers":[{"option":"Impotence","explanation":"\nImpotence is common in men with hyperprolactinemia, which causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Prolactin inhibits the synthesis and release of GnRH, which results in low levels of FSH and LH secretion. Low levels of LH lead to low production of testosterone in testicular Leydig cells. In men, the lack of testosterone can cause erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, reduced testicular volume, impaired fertility, and loss of axillary hair. Pituitary macroadenomas may cause headaches and bitemporal hemianopia due to compression of the surrounding structures (e.g., optic chiasm).","bool":true},{"option":"Galactorrhea","explanation":"\nGalactorrhea occurs in hyperprolactinemia because prolactin stimulates milk production in the breasts. Hyperprolactinemia can be due to a prolactinoma or any sellar tumor that disrupts the inhibitory effect of the hypothalamus on the pituitary gland. Galactorrhea is commonly seen in premenopausal women with hyperprolactinemia. However, this finding is very rare in postmenopausal women and male patients with hyperprolactinemia. Another finding is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Polyuria","explanation":"\nPolyuria is seen in diabetes insipidus, which could be due to a pituitary apoplexy. This condition would also cause headaches and visual disturbances, which are seen in this patient. However, pituitary apoplexy would present with acute rather than chronic headaches. It would also lead to a sudden lack of secretion of all hormones of the pituitary (panhypopituitarism). Polyuria is not the most likely finding in this patient with a pituitary adenoma who does not have signs or symptoms of a deficiency of any of the other pituitary hormones.","bool":false},{"option":"Macroglossia","explanation":"\nMacroglossia can be found in adults with growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, which results in acromegaly. The mass effect of this kind of pituitary adenoma could explain this patient's headaches and bitemporal hemianopia.

Toxic adenomas are uncommon in children and radionuclide scanning is rarely indicated in children with primary hypothyroidism.","bool":false},{"option":"Low urine iodine levels","explanation":"Low urine iodine levels indicate iodine deficiency, which can lead to hypothyroidism and goiter. However, with the introduction of iodized salt in the 1920's, iodine deficiency has become exceedingly rare in the US, making another condition much more likely. In developing countries where a low iodine diet is common, this patient's symptoms would most likely be the result of iodine deficiency.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate","explanation":"An increased ESR in a patient with goiter may indicate subacute thyroiditis, which most often occurs in women 30–50 years and presents with a painful, diffuse, and firm goiter, and a clinical course of hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism, and finally a return to euthyroidism over the span of several months.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's findings?\n","difficulty":3,"hint":"Obesity is a known risk factor for precocious puberty. Depending on the predominant pathomechanism, obesity can result in either central or peripheral precocious puberty. An increase in luteinizing hormone following the leuprolide stimulation test can distinguish between the two mechanisms.","answers":[{"option":"Pulsatile GnRH release","explanation":"\nObesity in children is associated with an overproduction of leptin, which results in increased GnRH pulsatility. This, in turn, triggers central precocious puberty (CPP). Central precocious sexual development usually follows the physiological order of sexual development (i.e. thelarche, pubarche, menarche), which is consistent with this girl's symptoms. The patient should undergo cranial MRI to assess for an intracranial etiology of her CPP (e.g., hypothalamic tumor, intracranial hamartoma).\nObesity can also cause precocious puberty by a peripheral mechanism: Increased insulin resistance leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia resulting in hormone imbalances that cause premature adrenarche, thelarche, and pubarche. There is no rise in GnRH pulsatility in this mechanism. Therefore, gonadal maturity (menarche, spermarche) is not seen in precocious puberty purely due to hyperinsulinemia. Most importantly, peripheral precocious puberty is characterized by a lack of increase in luteinizing hormone following the GnRH agonist stimulation test (e.g., with leuprolide).","bool":true},{"option":"Compensatory hyperinsulinemia","explanation":"Compensatory hyperinsulinemia can occur due to insulin resistance in children with obesity. Hyperinsulinemia results in a decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), an increase in free sex steroids levels, and premature adrenarche with increased adrenal androgen production. The resulting hyperandrogenemia triggers precocious puberty, but by a peripheral mechanism which is characterized by a lack of increase in luteinizing hormone levels after leuprolide stimulation. In addition, this patient's development of sexual characteristics follows the typical order of pubertal changes in girls, which is not typical of peripheral precocious puberty.","bool":false},{"option":"Overproduction of adrenal cortisol","explanation":"\nHypercortisolism due to an adrenal tumor or an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma is an important differential diagnosis to consider in overweight children with altered sexual development. Cushing syndrome may be associated with weight gain and dermatological changes. However, it is not associated with precocious puberty. Rather, Cushing syndrome would likely arrest or delay puberty due to inhibition of GnRH secretion. In addition, obesity-related to Cushing syndrome usually involves the head, neck, and trunk but spares the extremities, which is not the case in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase","explanation":"Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, which is the most common adrenal enzyme deficiency, results in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Nonclassic CAH (late-onset CAH) typically manifests with precocious puberty but causes the peripheral type, characterized by a lack of increase in luteinizing hormone following leuprolide stimulation test. Classical CAH typically manifests with early-onset symptoms, for example, in girls with congenital virilization (e.g., clitoromegaly).","bool":false},{"option":"Ectopic hormone production","explanation":"\nHormone-producing ovarian cysts are the most common cause of peripheral precocious puberty in girls. This condition typically manifests with early breast development followed by episodes of vaginal bleeding, which occur due to estrogen withdrawal once the cyst regresses. In ectopic estrogen production, LH and FSH levels are suppressed to prepubertal levels due to elevated sex hormone levels, and a leuprolide stimulation test does not increase LH levels, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.\nThis is a difficult question designed to test your knowledge about the different pathomechanisms behind precocious puberty. If a boy &lt; 9 years of age or a girl &lt; 8 years of age presents with features of puberty and their bone age differs by &gt; 1 year compared to chronological age, precocious puberty must be suspected. A GnRH/leuprolide stimulation test is used to differentiate central from peripheral causes of precocious puberty. An increase in gonadotropins (LH and FSH) after GnRH stimulation indicates that the central mechanism of LH and FSH release is not inhibited by high levels of sex hormones, which would be expected in peripheral precocious puberty. In this case, the mechanism behind precocious puberty is GnRH dependent, that is, central.

In addition, testosterone can be peripherally converted into estrogen, which promotes female breast and pubertal development.\nAIS also prevents the cranial suspensory ligament from regressing and therefore the testes remain in the inguinal canal or abdomen. Because of the increased risk of malignant transformation of the cryptorchid testes, patients with AIS require an orchiectomy. Most patients delay surgery until after puberty to allow for full pubertal development and attainment of adult height. After surgery, patients who identify as women require estrogen replacement therapy. In patients with partial AIS, orchiectomy is usually performed before puberty and hormone replacement therapy (based on the individual's gender identity) may be initiated at the beginning of expected puberty.

The thyrotoxicosis is transient and usually resolves within 12 weeks, when the maternal TRAb disappears from the infant's circulation. Before resolution, though, neonatal thyrotoxicosis should be treated as soon as it is diagnosed to prevent complications such as cardiac failure, intellectual disability, and craniosynostosis.

She appears lethargic. Physical examination shows deep and labored breathing and dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Urine dipstick is positive for ketones and glucose. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and a 6-week history of polydipsia and weight loss. Together with Kussmaul breathing (deep and labored breathing), dehydration (dry mucous membranes), glucosuria, and ketonuria, these symptoms indicate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which causes an anion gap metabolic acidosis.","answers":[{"option":"Decreased total body potassium","explanation":"\nDKA typically occurs in individuals with undiagnosed, untreated type 1 diabetes mellitus or treatment failure in known diabetics. Absolute insulin deficiency results in hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality. As a result, K+ shifts along with water from inside cells to the extracellular space and is lost in the urine. Moreover, the insulin that normally promotes cellular potassium uptake is absent in DKA, compounding the problem. A total body K+ deficit, therefore, develops in the body, although serum K+ may be normal or even paradoxically elevated.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased arterial blood pH","explanation":"\nDKA causes metabolic acidosis, which leads to decreased arterial blood pH (not increased). The insulin deficiency in DKA increases lipolysis, resulting in more free fatty acids. In the liver, free fatty acids are converted to ketones, two of which are acidic (acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid).","bool":false},{"option":"Serum glucose concentration &gt; 800 mg/dL","explanation":"In DKA, serum glucose concentration is increased due to insulin deficiency. However, serum glucose rarely exceeds 600 or 650 mg/dL because ketogenesis (due to insulin deficiency) usually begins at lower glucose concentrations and causes symptoms earlier. A hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), on the other hand, does not involve ketogenesis (there are residual insulin levels that suppresses lipolysis and ketogenesis) and usually presents with serum glucose levels &gt; 600 mg/dL. The ketonuria and hyperventilation in this patient argue against HHS.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased arterial pCO2","explanation":"\nDKA causes a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap. In response to the acidosis, patients typically exhibit a deep and labored breathing pattern (Kussmaul breathing) to provide respiratory compensation, as seen with this patient. The higher depth and rate of breaths results in an increase in carbon dioxide exhalation and subsequently a decrease in arterial pCO2 (compensatory respiratory alkalosis).","bool":false},{"option":"Excess water retention","explanation":"Patients with DKA typically present with hypovolemia and severe dehydration rather than excess water retention. In DKA, hyperglycemia leads to osmotic diuresis which typically manifests as polyuria and polydipsia, as seen in this patient.

She has a hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.5%, confirmed with a random blood glucose of 200 mg/dL, along with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria).","answers":[{"option":"Increased glomerular filtration","explanation":"\nIncreased glomerular filtration is the underlying cause of proteinuria. Increased glomerular filtration is caused by glycation, which results from chronic hyperglycemia. Glycation causes increased permeability and thickening of the basement membrane, thereby leading to urinary excretion of albumin. Glycation also increases the rigidity of the efferent glomerular arterioles, which accelerates hyperfiltration and mesangial expansion and causes progressive loss of glomerular function. This chronic degenerative process can be monitored by measuring urine albumin levels.\nMicroalbuminuria (urine albumin levels of 30–300 mg/day) is the earliest sign of diabetic nephropathy. ACE inhibitors, which have a protective effect against renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and prevent the progression of albuminuria, are the first-line antihypertensive treatment for patients with diabetes.","bool":true},{"option":"Continuous activation of complement C3","explanation":"Continuous activation of complement C3 is the underlying cause of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN 2), which can manifest with proteinuria in severe cases. However, when proteinuria is present, excreted levels are typically in the nephrotic range (≥ 3.5 g/day) and accompanied by manifestations of nephrotic syndrome (e.g., edema, hypoproteinemia, hyperlipidemia).

In Alport syndrome, patients also present with bilateral hearing loss.","bool":false},{"option":"Renal papillary necrosis","explanation":"\nRenal papillary necrosis leads to proteinuria and may be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, renal papillary necrosis is accompanied by tubular proteinuria (i.e., the excretion of lower molecular weight proteins) rather than the excretion of albumin, which indicates glomerular damage. Furthermore, gross hematuria would be expected in renal papillary necrosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Diffuse nodular glomerulosclerosis","explanation":"Diffuse glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules) is a characteristic finding of diabetic nephropathy that occurs in later stages of the disease, following glomerular basement membrane thickening and a period of mesangial expansion due to chronic hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, elevated levels of growth hormones, and intraglomerular hypertension.

Vitamin D in its active form, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, raises serum calcium and phosphate levels by increasing absorption from the intestine and kidneys. At high levels, vitamin D also stimulates bone resorption, resulting in calcium and phosphate release. Moreover, vitamin D directly suppresses PTH release, explaining the low PTH levels. The next step in management is to measure serum concentrations of the vitamin D metabolites in order to confirm the etiology of this patient's hypercalcemia.","bool":true},{"option":"Vitamin A toxicity","explanation":"Chronic vitamin A toxicity due to excessive intake of vitamin supplements may rarely lead to hypercalcemia, manifesting with constipation and decreased appetite.

Moreover, thiazide diuretics reduce serum phosphate levels, in contrast to the increased phosphate levels seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Primary hyperparathyroidism","explanation":"\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is one of the most common causes of hypercalcemia. This patient's PTH levels, however, are decreased rather than increased.","bool":false},{"option":"Primary hypothyroidism","explanation":"This patient's elevated TSH level, despite treatment with levothyroxine use, suggests that she is in a hypothyroid state. While hyperthyroidism may lead to mildly elevated calcium levels due to TSH-mediated increased bone resorption, hypothyroidism is not associated with hypercalcemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Excess calcium carbonate intake","explanation":"\nCalcium carbonate is used both as an antacid and calcium supplement. Ingestion of large amounts may cause milk-alkali syndrome, which manifests with hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, and acute kidney injury.

The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated serum glucagon levels. An abdominal ultrasound showing masses in the pancreas and liver is likely indicative of metastatic disease.","answers":[{"option":"Administer octreotide","explanation":"\nOctreotide, a somatostatin analog, reduces the secretion of glucagon to control the symptoms resulting from hypersecretion of glucagon (hyperglycemia, diarrhea, necrolytic migratory erythema, neurologic symptoms). In addition to supportive care (e.g., control of hyperglycemia), octreotide is the preferred initial therapy to bring these symptoms under rapid control.","bool":true},{"option":"Schedule distal pancreatectomy","explanation":"Resection of the distal portion of the pancreas is the definitive treatment for glucagonoma that is strictly localized to the pancreas and not metastasized. In localized disease, resection can lead to rapid resolution of symptoms. However, localized glucagonoma is rare and this patient already shows features that are highly suspicious for metastatic disease (liver lesions on ultrasound), which requires further evaluation before determining a surgical treatment option. Furthermore, even if the disease is localized, this patient's symptoms and hyperglycemia should be resolved before surgery.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform endoscopic ultrasonography","explanation":"\nEndoscopic ultrasound provides excellent spatial resolution (up to 2–3 mm), allowing detection of very small tumors and providing more accurate information on the local disease extent.

Dietary interventions for children and adolescents with obesity should not consist of strict diet regimens but rather focus on the long-term promotion of healthy eating behaviors such as increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables and minimizing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and saturated fats. Reducing body weight and abdominal fat subsequently increases insulin sensitivity and reduces blood pressure and lipids, and there may also be long-term effects as weight loss may help in preventing or delaying the onset of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In this patient, however, there is no report of excess vitamin D intake and there are no clinical features of granulomatous disease or lymphoma.","bool":false},{"option":"B","explanation":"These laboratory values are seen in primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), which is most commonly caused by parathyroid adenoma. Most patients with pHPT are asymptomatic, but symptoms of hypercalcemia may occur. In pHPT, high levels of PTH increase serum calcium levels by increasing bone turnover and renal calcium reabsorption. Increased PTH levels also cause hypophosphatemia by preventing renal phosphate reabsorption. Moreover, PTH induces renal hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This patient, however, has a recent history of renal cancer rather than parathyroid gland adenoma or hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands.","bool":false},{"option":"C","explanation":"These laboratory values are seen in humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, which is caused by ectopic secretion of PTHrP from solid tumors (most commonly renal cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or squamous cell cancers of the head, neck, or lung). PTHrP activates PTH receptors and increases bone resorption, renal calcium absorption, and phosphate excretion, leading to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypercalcemia further suppresses the secretion of PTH, causing hypoparathyroidism. Unlike PTH, PTHrP does not stimulate the hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), therefore low calcitriol levels can be expected in hypercalcemia of malignancy.","bool":true},{"option":"D","explanation":"These laboratory values are seen in tertiary hyperparathyroidism (tHPT), which is most commonly caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) and manifests with hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The insufficient production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in CKD causes hypocalcemia, which can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT). Persistent sHPT leads to the development of functionally autonomous parathyroid glands that continually release PTH (i.e., tHPT), inducing increased bone resorption and hypercalcemia. Patients with tHPT commonly have decreased phosphate excretion due to impaired renal function. Although this patient presents with symptoms of hypercalcemia, he does not have a history of CKD.","bool":false},{"option":"E","explanation":"These laboratory values can be seen in pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP), which is caused by renal tubular resistance to PTH.

Hypocortisolism leads to an increase in ADH, and, consequently, free water retention and hyponatremia. Furthermore, hypoglycemia is caused by decreased gluconeogenesis, which is normally promoted by cortisol. Potassium and bicarbonate levels remain normal in secondary adrenal insufficiency, as aldosterone secretion is controlled primarily via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Secondary adrenal insufficiency may be caused by the sudden discontinuation of chronic glucocorticoid therapy, or, in rare cases, hypopituitarism (e.g., as a result of pituitary microadenoma that causes isolated ACTH deficiency). Adrenal insufficiency associated with glucocorticoid use is due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, which leads to decreased endogenous ACTH production and, in turn, insufficient serum cortisol levels in the absence of exogenous glucocorticoids.","bool":true}]},{"id":48,"info":"Endocrine System","question":"A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found by his neighbor in a somnolent state.

Serum estrogen, which steadily increases during pregnancy, stimulates pituitary lactotrophs, resulting in lactotroph hyperplasia and increased prolactin production. This lactotroph hyperplasia can cause up to 40% increase from pregestational volume by the end of pregnancy. Of note, the number of thyrotrophs and corticotrophs remains unchanged and the number of somatotrophs and gonadotrophs decreases during pregnancy. The pituitary gland regains its normal pregestational size and cell-ratio at ∼ 6 months postpartum.\nPhysiological pituitary enlargement can also result from gonadotroph hyperplasia, which is a potential finding in puberty (due to hypothalamic GnRH production) and after menopause (due to decreased circulating estrogen and loss of negative feedback).","bool":true},{"option":"Prolactinoma","explanation":"A prolactinoma, which is the most common tumor of the pituitary gland, can enlarge during pregnancy as a result of the hyperestrogenic state.

Dopamine secreted by the hypothalamus normally inhibits the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Although typical antipsychotics are most commonly associated with this side effect, atypical antipsychotics, especially risperidone, can also cause hyperprolactinemia. Risperidone antagonizes D2 dopaminergic receptors, decreasing dopamine's tonic inhibition of prolactin secretion and resulting in hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin acts directly on breast epithelial cells to stimulate milk production (hence this patient's galactorrhea).

Slightly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), low thyroid blood flow on Doppler ultrasonography, and the onset of symptoms within one year of delivery are consistent with postpartum thyroiditis.","answers":[{"option":"Release of thyroid hormone from damaged follicular cells","explanation":"\nPostpartum thyroiditis (PPT) is caused by a subacute autoimmune inflammation of the thyroid gland that results in lymphocytic infiltration, destruction of the follicular cells, and subsequent release of preformed thyroid hormones. Affected individuals most commonly present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, followed by a hypothyroid phase due to the exhaustion of thyroglobulin stores and the inhibition of TSH secretion by high concentrations of serum thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). As the inflammation remits, the follicles regenerate and hormone synthesis resumes, reestablishing the euthyroid state. Although the sequence of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism is typical, isolated transient hyper- or hypothyroidism also occurs. Physical examination of the thyroid gland can be normal or show a painless goiter, as seen in this patient. Radioimmunoassay shows thyroid peroxidase antibodies in approx. 60% of patients and is classically negative for TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs), which helps differentiate PPT from Graves disease.\nPPT is usually self-limiting, but patients with bothersome symptoms of hyperthyroidism can be treated with beta blockers (e.g., propranolol).

A large goiter can cause dysphagia due to esophageal compression.","answers":[{"option":"Positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies in serum","explanation":"\nThyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) are typically only present in the thyroid gland and thus sequestered from the systemic immune system. In Hashimoto thyroiditis, genetic and environmental factors are thought to cause immune sensitization to self-antigens such as TPO and Tg, which results in chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. As such, thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) can be detected in the majority of patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and can be used to assess disease activity (see “Overview of thyroid antibodies” table).\nRadioactive iodine scan is not part of the regular workup of Hashimoto thyroiditis; the findings are highly variable but iodine uptake may be decreased in transient thyrotoxicosis.

Furthermore, CD usually manifests with signs of malabsorption such as weight loss and anemia. Extraintestinal symptoms like erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, and/or uveitis may also be present. More importantly, CD would not explain this patient's laboratory abnormalities, cutaneous flushing, or achlorhydria.","bool":false},{"option":"Excessive accumulation of mast cells","explanation":"\nSystemic mastocytosis could cause significant diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and cutaneous flushing. The excessive accumulation of mast cells seen in this disease can localize to specific organs, like the intestine, where synchronous activation leads to an excessive release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, prostaglandins, proteases, and various cytokines. The skin is often involved and patients typically report pruritus and urticaria.

These drugs benefit T2DM patients by reducing insulin resistance, not by increasing insulin secretion.","bool":false},{"option":"Metformin","explanation":"\nMetformin (biguanide) exerts its action by enhancing the effects of insulin in two major ways. First, metformin decreases hepatic glucose output by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and intestinal glucose absorption.

A history of smoking is the strongest risk factor for SCLC. Because SCLC is a pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor, it can produce hormones that are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes including Cushing syndrome, SIADH, and Lambert-Eaton syndrome. In Cushing syndrome due to SCLC, the affected cells produce ACTH, which is not suppressed by high cortisol and is resistant to negative feedback. Consequently, serum cortisol levels remain elevated following a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, as seen in this patient.\nOther cancers which are less commonly associated with the secretion of ACTH or ACTH-like substances include renal cell cancer, bronchial and pancreatic carcinoid tumors, and medullary thyroid carcinomas.","bool":true},{"option":"Pituitary adenoma","explanation":"A corticotropic pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease) would result in secondary hypercortisolism due to increased ACTH production by the tumor.

Hyperglycemia increases blood osmolarity, which triggers a shift of fluid from the intracellular compartment to the extracellular compartment in an attempt to normalize blood osmolarity. The shift of fluid to the extracellular space also causes intracellular K+ to shift passively down the concentration gradient into the extracellular compartment. The acidemic state also contributes to hyperkalemia by inducing the movement of K+ into the extracellular space in exchange for H+ via H+/K+ antiporters. K+ requires insulin to shift back into the intracellular compartment and hence, cannot easily shift back into the intracellular compartment in patients with insulin deficiency.\nDespite hyperkalemia, patients with DKA actually have a total body K+ deficit due to increased renal K+ loss as a result of osmotic diuresis.

If a thyroid profile were to be done in this patient, the most likely results would be decreased thyroglobulin and TSH levels and increased T3 and T4 levels.","answers":[{"option":"Exogenous thyrotoxicosis","explanation":"Over-the-counter weight-loss supplements and herbal products commonly contain thyroid hormones in amounts high enough to cause thyrotoxicosis. Other groups at high risk for factitious hyperthyroidism are medical personnel who have access to L-thyroxine and use it to lose weight, receive insurance compensation (malingering), or gain attention (Munchausen syndrome/factitious disorder). Goiter, which may be present in some forms of endogenous hyperthyroidism, is absent in patients with exogenous thyrotoxicosis. Low or undetectable thyroglobulin levels indicate that exogenous thyroid hormones have caused the thyroid gland to stop producing endogenous hormones and thus confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes tapering and ceasing the exogenous hormone intake. Beta blockers can be considered for severely symptomatic patients.","bool":true},{"option":"Acute stress disorder","explanation":"\nAcute stress disorder is a trauma- and stressor-related disorder. To establish this diagnosis, a patient must meet a wide range of criteria that include arousal symptoms such as the sleep disturbance and irritability seen here, but also and more importantly a history of trauma as well as symptoms of intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, and avoidance. Furthermore, this patient's neurological findings of hyperreflexia and resting tremor suggest a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Graves disease","explanation":"\nGraves disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism and is characterized by the presence of stimulating TSH receptor autoantibodies. However, unlike this patient, individuals with Graves disease typically present with diffuse goiter, Graves ophthalmopathy, and pretibial myxedema.","bool":false},{"option":"Generalized anxiety disorder","explanation":"While patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may present with irritability, restlessness, and sleep disturbance, patients typically do not show neurological findings such as the increased reflexes seen in this case. Furthermore, GAD is characterized by prolonged and excessive anxiety that is either unspecific or revolves around certain themes (e.g., health, work).","bool":false},{"option":"Hashimoto thyroiditis","explanation":"\nHashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies against the thyroid gland lead to the gradual destruction of thyroid tissue. While hyperthyroidism can occasionally be present in acute phases of Hashimoto thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis), the disease is typically asymptomatic in its early stages and only manifests with hypothyroidism in later stages. Hashimoto thyroiditis is, therefore, not the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Coffee consumption","explanation":"Excessive consumption of stimulants such as caffeine, which is found in coffee and some weight-loss supplements, can cause restlessness, sleep disturbances, tachycardia, hyperreflexia, resting tremor, and palpitations. This patient's weight loss medication may be the source of her symptoms. However, her daily routine of drinking 2–3 cups of coffee is generally regarded as safe for regular consumption. Furthermore, her regular coffee consumption has been a longstanding habit and she is now likely to be well-tolerant to this level of caffeine intake. Therefore, coffee is unlikely to be the cause of her rather recent onset of symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Pheochromocytoma","explanation":"\nPheochromocytoma can also present with episodic or persistent hypertension, palpitations, and tachycardia as well as weight loss and diaphoresis (sweating) due to the massive release of catecholamines into the systemic circulation. If examined during such an episode, patients could also exhibit resting tremor and hyperreflexia. However, pheochromocytomas commonly cause throbbing headaches, nausea, pallor, and abdominal pain, none of which this patient has.

The failure of cortisol to increase after the cosyntropin stimulation test confirms the diagnosis. Hyperpigmentation of the buccal mucosa (due to excess production of MSH, a byproduct of ACTH synthesis) indicates primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease).","answers":[{"option":"F","explanation":"These findings are consistent with Addison disease. Lack of aldosterone leads to diminished renal sodium and water absorption, causing hypovolemia and hyponatremia. Renal excretion of potassium and protons is also impaired, resulting in hyperkalemia and mild hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (decreased bicarbonate). Hypocortisolism directly causes nausea, weight loss, and hypotension, as in this patient, and triggers ADH release, which contributes to hyponatremia. Finally, loss of the gluconeogenic effect of cortisol causes hypoglycemia.\nThe most common cause of Addison disease is autoimmune adrenalitis. There is an increased prevalence of other autoimmune conditions in patients with Addison disease, including vitiligo, as seen here. Primary adrenal insufficiency is also a common manifestation in patients with polyglandular autoimmune syndromes.","bool":true},{"option":"E","explanation":"These values are consistent with excessive use of potassium-wasting diuretics like thiazides, not with primary adrenal insufficiency. Enhanced excretion of sodium and chloride, as well as loss of potassium due to increased activity of the Na+-K+ cotransporter, leads to hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, with normal glucose levels. This patient has no history of diuretic use. Moreover, diuretic use would not explain the negative cosyntropin test, nor the hyperpigmentation of the buccal mucosa.","bool":false},{"option":"C","explanation":"These values are consistent with primary hyperaldosteronism, not primary adrenal insufficiency. In this condition, excessive production of aldosterone leads to sodium and water retention. Increased sodium reabsorption, in turn, leads to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Even though primary hyperaldosteronism manifests with fatigue, which is seen in this patient, it is typically associated with drug-resistant hypertension, not hypotension. Moreover, it is not associated with hyperpigmentation or a negative cosyntropin test.","bool":false},{"option":"B","explanation":"These values are consistent with Cushing syndrome, not primary adrenal insufficiency. In this condition, the weak mineralocorticoid effects of excess cortisol lead to sodium and water retention as well as increased potassium excretion, causing metabolic alkalosis. Moreover, the glucocorticoid effects cause central obesity, thin skin, weight gain, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia. This patient does not have Cushingoid features and presents with findings that are directly opposed to what would be expected in Cushing syndrome, i.e., weight loss, hypotension, low serum cortisol concentration.","bool":false},{"option":"D","explanation":"These values are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis, not primary adrenal insufficiency. In this condition, insulin deficiency causes a hyperglycemic crisis, which leads to hyperosmolarity and production of ketone bodies. The hyperosmolar state causes potassium to be shifted out of cells along with water as a compensatory mechanism, resulting in hyperkalemia (although total body potassium is depleted). An increase in ketone bodies leads to an excess of acidic compounds (which is then buffered by bicarbonate), causing an overall metabolic acidosis with an anion gap. Although this patient is at risk for autoimmune disease due to his vitiligo, he does not have a history of diabetes or typical symptoms of DKA like polyuria, polydipsia, vomiting, or volume depletion. Furthermore, DKA is not associated with hyperpigmentation or a negative cosyntropin test.","bool":false},{"option":"A","explanation":"These findings would be seen in secondary adrenal insufficiency, not primary adrenal insufficiency. In this condition, decreased production of ACTH in the pituitary gland leads to hypocortisolism and hypoandrogenism. Consequently, hypoglycemia due to a decrease in gluconeogenesis (normally promoted by cortisol) would be seen, as well as hyponatremia due to an increase in ADH and free water retention. However, since aldosterone secretion is primarily controlled by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, secondary adrenal insufficiency is not associated with hypoaldosteronism, which is why potassium and bicarbonate levels remain normal. Moreover, although this patient shows signs of hypocortisolism, he lacks risk factors for secondary adrenal insufficiency like prolonged steroid use.

Which of the following factors is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient's obesity, acanthosis nigricans (hyperpigmented plaques in the axillae and neck), elevated serum insulin, and elevated HbA1c are consistent with insulin resistance.","answers":[{"option":"Increased levels of serum fatty acids","explanation":"\nElevated plasma free fatty acids (which is likely in this patient given her obesity) decrease insulin-mediated glucose uptake into tissues, resulting in insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. When insulin resistance first develops, the pancreas is able to compensate by increasing insulin secretion. Over the course of the disease, insulin resistance progresses and the ability of the pancreas to overcome this resistance declines, resulting in decreased endogenous insulin production and subsequent hyperglycemia.","bool":true},{"option":"Positive HLA-DR4 serotype","explanation":"Positive HLA-DR4 serotype is associated with the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can also manifest with hyperglycemia but is characterized by low insulin levels. This patient's age and obesity make T1DM unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased levels of serum cortisol","explanation":"Decreased levels of serum cortisol, as seen in primary adrenal insufficiency, would result in hypoglycemia rather than the hyperglycemia seen in this patient. Although patients with primary adrenal insufficiency may have hyperpigmentation, it is usually seen on the knuckles and buccal mucosa. The hyperpigmented plaques found on the axillae and posterior neck of this patient suggest acanthosis nigricans, which is associated with insulin resistance.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased levels of serum adiponectin","explanation":"Increased levels of serum adiponectin are associated with improved glucose metabolism and are part of the mechanism of action of thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone).

Hashimoto thyroiditis usually leads to clinical hypothyroidism, which may manifest with obesity and menstrual irregularities. However, the absence of additional features of hypothyroidism in this patient, such as fatigue, cold intolerance, dry skin, hair loss, loss of appetite, and constipation, makes a thyroid disorder unlikely. Furthermore, acanthosis nigricans is only rarely seen in patients with hypothyroidism.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Malignant glandular cells on gastric biopsy","explanation":"Malignant cells of glandular origin on a biopsy specimen of the stomach confirm the diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. The patient has peptic ulcer disease, which is a risk factor for gastric cancer. Gastrointestinal malignancies, especially gastric adenocarcinoma, are associated with malignant acanthosis nigricans, which is a paraneoplastic syndrome. While both the benign and malignant form of acanthosis nigricans manifest with velvety, hyperpigmented skin thickening, the paraneoplastic syndrome is characterized by rapid onset, a verrucous or papulous surface, and involvement of atypical sites (e.g., palms, soles, or mucous membranes), which is not the case in this patient. Moreover, the patient is young and has no signs of gastrointestinal malignancy, such as weight loss, anemia, abdominal pain, early satiety, nausea or vomiting, dysphagia, hematemesis, or melena. In addition, her irregular menstrual period and infertility could not be explained by this diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Atrophic adrenal glands on CT scan of the abdomen","explanation":"\nAtrophic adrenal glands are typically seen on an abdominal CT scan in cases of autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency. This disorder typically manifests with hypotension, weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, intestinal complaints (nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea), loss of axillary and pubic hair, and hyperpigmentation due to increased production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Although this patient has hyperpigmented skin lesions, the hyperpigmentation in adrenal insufficiency is typically diffuse and involves areas that are not normally exposed to sunlight (e.g., palm creases, mucous membrane of the oral cavity).

Affected individuals usually have a normal length at birth, but growth velocity decreases between 6 months and 3 years of age. Bone age is typically delayed by 2–4 years causing growth to take longer than usual. After a growth spurt in late adolescence, patients usually reach a normal adult height. While patients should be closely monitored to ensure that growth velocity does not decrease further, treatment is not indicated.\nFurther testing to rule out pathological causes should be performed in all patients with delayed puberty, who present with changes in growth velocity for at least 6 months and/or with signs of underlying disease. Testing should include a CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, BUN, creatinine, liver function tests, and hormonal tests (e.g., LH, FSH, estradiol, testosterone, TSH).","bool":true},{"option":"MRI of the brain","explanation":"An MRI of the brain can be used in the diagnosis of intracranial neoplasms. Mass effect of hypothalamic or pituitary tumors can cause a deficiency of growth hormone, LH, and FSH, which subsequently causes short stature and delayed puberty. Craniopharyngiomas are most common in children and teenagers, but a tumor large enough to cause hormone deficiencies would likely also manifest with visual field defects (bitemporal hemianopsia). Further, imaging of the brain is only indicated in patients that have established hormone deficiencies or are at high risk for intracranial neoplasm (e.g., history of cranial irradiation).","bool":false},{"option":"Growth hormone therapy","explanation":"\nGrowth hormone (GH) therapy can be used to increase growth in children with idiopathic short stature, Turner syndrome, or GH deficiency (GHD). However, patients with Turner syndrome and idiopathic short stature disorders typically present with a bone age normal for their chronological age. Patients with GHD can have a delayed bone age and experience delayed puberty. However, in cases of GHD, either a growth delay is apparent within the first few months of life, or the associated characteristic features of acquired GHD, such as an immature (“cherubic”) fat distribution and characteristic facial features (underdeveloped nasal bridge and frontal bossing), are present. Moreover, before GH supplementation is initiated, a definitive diagnosis should be unequivocally established with hormonal assays and serial measurements of length or height. Therefore, GH treatment is not appropriate as the next step of management in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Genetic karyotyping","explanation":"Genetic karyotyping can be used to diagnose chromosomal anomalies such as Turner syndrome. While patients with Turner syndrome also have short stature and delayed puberty, they also present with other characteristic signs of the condition such as a webbed neck, shield chest, and cardiac and renal malformations, which are absent in this patient. Furthermore, Turner syndrome would not explain this patient's delayed bone age.","bool":false},{"option":"Measure serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels","explanation":"Measurement of serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels can help differentiate congenital GnRH deficiency (e.g., in Kallmann syndrome) from constitutional delay of puberty. Although patients with congenital GnRH deficiency can also have delayed bone age, delayed puberty, and short stature, adrenarche occurs normally, usually leading to the development of some pubic hair which is not seen in this patient. In addition, congenital GnRH deficiency is very rare and often associated with other findings (e.g., hyposmia/anosmia in Kallmann syndrome or skeletal abnormalities such as cleft lip/palate or syndactyly). While congenital GnRH deficiency cannot be entirely excluded in this patient, measurement of serum DHEA is not indicated at this time.","bool":false},{"option":"Pelvic ultrasound","explanation":"A pelvic ultrasound can be used in the evaluation of delayed puberty and/or primary amenorrhea if a pelvic mass or anatomical anomalies of the genital tract are suspected.

A pelvic ultrasound is therefore not indicated in the initial workup.","bool":false},{"option":"Measurement of blood glucose level","explanation":"Measurement blood glucose levels can be used to screen patients for diabetes. Many systemic illnesses, including diabetes mellitus, can cause a growth delay. Although, type 1 diabetes is more common in children and adolescents and can also present with delayed growth, patients typically also present with weight loss, polydipsia, and polyuria, all of which are absent in this patient.

The Y chromosome results in the formation of the testes (instead of the ovaries) from the undifferentiated fetal gonad. The uterus does not develop because the anti-Mullerian hormone secreted by the testes causes Mullerian duct atresia. However, the genital tubercle in AIS is not responsive to testosterone, so masculinization of the external genitalia does not occur. AIS also results in a failure of the cranial suspensory ligament to regress, meaning the testes remain in the inguinal canal or abdomen instead of the perineal region. Patients are born with female external genitalia and are generally raised as women. At the time of puberty, axillary and pubic hair growth is also absent or decreased since cutaneous androgen receptors lack sensitivity. Breast development occurs despite the absence of ovaries since aromatase in adipose tissue converts androgens produced by the inguinal testes to estradiol.\nHormonal analysis in patients with AIS shows elevated LH levels due to insensitivity of the pituitary gland to androgen and possibly elevated testosterone levels due to stimulation of the Leydig cells by LH. The diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing, which shows a mutation in the AR gene on chromosome Xq. Patients with complete AIS usually have a female gender identity.","bool":true},{"option":"SRY gene defect","explanation":"A defect in the SRY gene on chromosome Y results in Swyer syndrome, which manifests with primary amenorrhea and absent or atretic ovaries on ultrasound.

Hypovolemic hyponatremia is a characteristic feature of diabetic ketoacidosis and occurs due to the osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia and glucosuria. In dilutional hyponatremia, increased serum osmolality from hyperglycemia causes water to shift from the intracellular to the extracellular space, resulting in a decreased serum sodium concentration.

Fluid repletion with IV saline helps normalize the calcium concentration via dilution and increased renal excretion of calcium. For rapid-onset, short-term control of hypercalcemia, intravenous calcitonin therapy is often added to supplement IV fluid therapy. Patients whose hypercalcemia is associated with increased levels of vitamin D (e.g., sarcoidosis, lymphoma) may also require targeted therapy with systemic corticosteroids, which decrease the production and promote the degradation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.\nSarcoidosis can lead to hypercalcemia via the expression of 1α-hydroxylase from macrophages within noncaseating granulomas, which results in the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to the metabolically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. High levels of calcitriol increase blood calcium levels, which, in turn, result in compensatory hypoparathyroidism and a consequent increase in the urinary elimination of calcium.

In individuals with CKD, insufficient production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D causes hypocalcemia, which can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT). Persistent sHPT leads to the development of functionally autonomous parathyroid glands that continually release PTH (i.e., tHPT), inducing increased bone resorption and hypercalcemia.

This enzyme deficiency is the most common cause of CAH and results in decreased synthesis of mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone) and glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisone). Hypoaldosteronism causes hypotension and hyperkalemia and hypocortisolism leads to an increase in the secretion of ACTH from the pituitary gland.

TB can affect any organ, including the adrenal glands causing infectious adrenalitis, which may result in symptoms of chronic primary adrenal insufficiency and bilateral adrenal enlargement. Further management of this patient should include confirmation of TB with sputum microscopy and PCR, initiation of the appropriate TB treatment, and replacement of the deficient glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.\nNormally, hypoglycemia is expected in patients with primary adrenocortical insufficiency because of the lack of glucocorticoid-mediated diabetogenic effects. However, this patient is diabetic and glucose control is likely hindered by the current infection.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Autoimmune adrenalitis","explanation":"\nAutoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenocortical insufficiency. It commonly occurs in association with other autoimmune diseases as part of a polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, e.g., together with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although this patient's fatigue, hypotension, low cortisol, and elevated ACTH are signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, the simultaneous presence of productive cough, fevers, and weight loss, as well as history of immigration, make a different underlying cause more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Adrenal hemorrhage","explanation":"\nAdrenal hemorrhage may be caused by anticoagulation therapy or Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, which may be seen in Neisseria meningitis septicemia. This patient is currently not on any anticoagulative medications and, besides the lethargy and hypotension, there is little evidence to suggest acute meningococcal sepsis, which might consist of altered mental status, shock, or coagulopathy-induced purpura and ecchymoses.","bool":false},{"option":"Amyloid deposition","explanation":"\nAmyloidosis may affect any organ, including the adrenals. Although amyloid infiltration of the adrenal glands may cause bilateral adrenal enlargement, the progression of the disease would assume more of a chronic course than 2 months. Furthermore, there is no evidence of plasma cell disorders, chronic inflammation, chronic kidney disease, or a family history of amyloidosis in this patient, which might suggest amyloidosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Pituitary tumor","explanation":"A pituitary gland tumor may cause adrenal insufficiency if ACTH production is impaired (secondary adrenal insufficiency). The presentation with fatigue, hypotension, and low cortisol would be similar, but ACTH would be low rather than elevated.

Other symptoms include loss of libido, as well as gynecomastia in men and galactorrhea, amenorrhea and infertility in women.","bool":true},{"option":"Somatotrophs","explanation":"Somatotroph cells are growth hormone-secreting cells in the pituitary gland. Somatotroph adenomas account for about 15% of all pituitary adenomas. Constantly increased levels of GH can lead to acromegaly, which this patient does not have. Erectile dysfunction is not caused by somatotroph adenomas.","bool":false},{"option":"Corticotrophs","explanation":"Corticotroph cells are ACTH-secreting cells in the pituitary gland. Corticotropinomas only account for about 5% of all pituitary adenomas. Increased ACTH production causes a secondary hypercortisolism through stimulation of the adrenal cortex, also called Cushing disease. The most common symptoms are central obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, hypertension, osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, hirsutism and thin and easily bruisable skin, none of which are present in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Thyrotrophs","explanation":"Thyrotroph cells are TSH-secreting cells in the pituitary gland.

For the past two months, she has not been able to lactate and had to start feeding her son with formula. She reports that she often feels cold and has been wearing more layers than before pregnancy. She has not had her menses again since the delivery. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 56/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 92/61 mm Hg. Examination shows sparse pubic hair. Which of the following findings is most likely in this patient?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This puerperal patient has symptoms of several hormone deficiencies: hypoprolactinemia (failure to lactate), hypothyroidism (cold intolerance and bradycardia), hypocortisolism (hypotension and lethargy), and hypogonadism (amenorrhea and loss of pubic hair). In the context of severe postpartum hemorrhage, these findings suggest Sheehan syndrome.","answers":[{"option":"Empty sella turcica on MRI of the brain","explanation":"An empty sella turcica is a common imaging finding in patients with Sheehan syndrome. The anterior pituitary gland receives its blood supply from a relatively low-pressure arterial system and is, therefore, vulnerable to ischemia and infarction. During pregnancy, hypertrophy of prolactin-producing regions increases the size of the pituitary gland, making it very sensitive to ischemia, e.g., secondary to prolonged or severe postpartum bleeding, which has occurred in this patient. In the months following the initial ischemic insult, the pituitary gland progressively atrophies, resulting in an empty sella turcica on brain imaging. Since the pattern of hormone deficiency may vary depending on the extent of pituitary necrosis, each hormone deficiency must be tested individually.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased serum level of aldosterone","explanation":"A decrease in serum aldosterone levels can be seen in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (e.g., due to autoimmune adrenalitis, adrenalectomy). Sheehan syndrome, however, causes secondary adrenal insufficiency (i.e., due to ACTH deficiency). Since aldosterone is regulated by the RAAS system, which is independent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, it remains unchanged in patients with Sheehan syndrome. In this patient with hypotension, aldosterone would most likely be increased.","bool":false},{"option":"Withdrawal bleeding after progesterone challenge test","explanation":"Withdrawal bleeding after a progesterone challenge test can be observed in amenorrheic women with anovulatory cycles (e.g., due to polycystic ovary syndrome). These cycles, in which no corpus luteum (and, therefore, no progesterone) is produced, result in unopposed hyperestrogenism and absent/irregular endometrial shedding, which lead to menstrual irregularities (e.g., amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea). Sheehan syndrome causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, resulting in decreased levels of both estrogen and progesterone. Therefore, withdrawal bleeding would only be expected after a combined estrogen and progesterone challenge test rather than a progesterone challenge test alone.","bool":false},{"option":"Low urine osmolality after desmopressin administration","explanation":"Low urine osmolality after desmopressin administration is characteristic of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI). Although it is rare (as the posterior pituitary receives its blood supply from a high-pressure arterial system, being less prone to ischemia than the anterior pituitary), central DI is associated with Sheehan syndrome, not nephrogenic DI. Central DI manifests with an increase rather than a decrease in urine osmolality after desmopressin administration.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased serum level of TSH","explanation":"Increased serum levels of TSH can be seen in patients with primary hypothyroidism. Sheehan syndrome, however, causes secondary hypothyroidism due to pituitary ischemia.

High cortisol levels in conjunction with low ACTH levels indicate primary hypercortisolism.","answers":[{"option":"CT scan of the abdomen","explanation":"This patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome due to autonomous overproduction of cortisol by the adrenal gland. Once Cushing syndrome has been determined to be ACTH-independent, a thin-section CT or MRI of the adrenal glands should be performed to evaluate for adrenal mass.

Also, this patient lacks other symptoms of lung cancer, such as cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and chest pain.","bool":false},{"option":"Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test","explanation":"A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test can be used in the initial screening for hypercortisolism. In normal individuals, dexamethasone suppresses ACTH secretion and thus decreases the level of cortisol. However, in this patient, the diagnosis of hypercortisolism using a 24–hour urine sample as well as a decreased ACTH level in serum has already been established, indicating an ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome. Therefore a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test would not be helpful in confirming the cause of his symptoms.\nHigh-dose dexamethasone suppression test can be used in patients with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism to differentiate whether the source of ACTH production is pituitary (Cushing disease) or ectopic.","bool":false},{"option":"CRH stimulation test","explanation":"\nCRH stimulation test can be used in patients with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism to differentiate whether the source of excess ACTH production is pituitary (Cushing disease) or ectopic. If serum ACTH and cortisol levels increase further after CRH stimulation, Cushing disease is confirmed; minimal or no change in their levels suggests ectopic ACTH production. Since the patient presents with ACTH-independent hypercortisolism, this test would not be indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"ACTH stimulation test","explanation":"\nACTH stimulation test is used to test the response of the adrenal glands to ACTH in patients suspected of having adrenal insufficiency (e.g., hypocortisolism), such as Addison disease.

Aldosteronomas are a common cause of primary hyperaldosteronism. Overproduction of aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption by the kidneys, resulting in hypertension and low serum renin levels. Furthermore, increased sodium resorption creates an electronegative tubular lumen in the late distal tubule and collecting tubules, leading to increased excretion of potassium and protons that follow the electrical gradient, which results in hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Aldosterone escape limits the expansion of the extracellular fluid volume and thus prevents edema formation.","bool":true},{"option":"Cushing syndrome","explanation":"\nCushing syndrome can manifest with hypertension, hypokalemia, fatigue, and muscle weakness, which are seen in this patient. Severe hypercortisolism can potentially suppress renin levels via a negative feedback mechanism on renal baroreceptors, although renin levels remain normal in most patients with Cushing syndrome. The absence of other important features of hypercortisolism such as weight gain (central obesity, moon facies, and buffalo hump), easily bruisable skin and stretch marks, hirsutism, or acne make this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Pheochromocytoma","explanation":"\nHypertension and recurrent episodes of headaches and palpitations are typical findings of pheochromocytoma. However, pheochromocytoma does not normally cause hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis.

The diagnosis of tertiary adrenal insufficiency, due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, is confirmed by decreased serum cortisol and serum ACTH.","answers":[{"option":"Hyponatremia","explanation":"\nAdrenal insufficiency related to corticosteroid use is associated with hyponatremia due to increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. Cortisol directly inhibits ADH secretion; loss of cortisol therefore leads to an increase in ADH, causing free water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. Symptoms that accompany hypocortisolism, e.g., nausea and vomiting, can also trigger ADH release. Hyponatremia from corticosteroid-related adrenal insufficiency is often not as pronounced as the hyponatremia seen in primary adrenal insufficiency. This is because aldosterone secretion from the zona glomerulosa remains intact.\nAdrenal insufficiency associated with chronic glucocorticoid use most commonly occurs after an acute illness or surgery if the glucocorticoid dose is not appropriately increased to meet the demand. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy should be started immediately in patients with adrenal crisis.","bool":true},{"option":"Hyperkalemia","explanation":"\nHyperkalemia may occur due to decreased secretion of aldosterone, as seen in primary adrenal insufficiency.

LH and insulin stimulate the theca cells in the ovary to produce androgens, which can cause symptoms such as androgenic alopecia, hirsutism, or acne. The androgens are converted into estrogens by aromatase in adipose tissue. Androgens from the ovary and estrogen from adipose tissue decrease the production of FSH via negative feedback. Consequently, an arrest in antral follicle development occurs and the granulosa cells, which normally produce estrogen, do not develop adequately. The lack of follicular development results in anovulatory cycles (no corpus luteum and no progesterone production), in which the endometrium continuously proliferates under the effect of estrogen from adipose tissue. The bleeding that occurs in PCOS is not true menstrual bleeding, which is caused by progesterone withdrawal at the end of the menstrual cycle, but anovulatory bleeding, in which partial shedding of the hyperplastic endometrium occurs intermittently at irregular intervals because estrogen cannot maintain the proliferating endometrium. In patients with anovulatory cycles, the administration of progesterone would result in differentiation and maintenance of the endometrium, and subsequent withdrawal of progesterone would cause withdrawal bleeding (progestin challenge test).\nPCOS is typically a diagnosis of exclusion that is made after other causes of amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, pregnancy) have been excluded.

This patient's head trauma likely caused damage to the infundibular stalk, impairing dopamine release and thereby causing loss of tonic inhibition of prolactin secretion. Prolactin stimulates lactation, as seen here, but also suppresses GnRH. Suppression of GnRH leads to decreased LH and FSH, which, in turn, causes decreased testosterone and symptoms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (i.e., loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, bilateral gynecomastia).

Additional signs of acute abdominal pain, nausea, Kussmaul breathing (deep and labored breathing), dehydration (dry mucous membranes), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and ketonuria all indicate life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), high anion gap metabolic acidosis.","answers":[{"option":"Decreased total body potassium","explanation":"\nDKA typically occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus if undiagnosed and untreated or treatment failure. There are 3 mechanisms that lead to the decreased total body K+ in DKA. First, the insulin deficiency that constitutes type 1 diabetes causes hyperglycemia and resulting hyperosmolality. This triggers K+ to shift with water from cells into the extracellular space, leading to possible hyperkalemia and loss in urine. Next, the insulin-driven cellular uptake of K+ via the Na+/K+-ATPase is absent. Lastly, elevated extracellular H+ levels from metabolic acidosis reduce activity of the Na+-H+ antiporter. This decreases the intracellular Na+ gradient, which also lowers activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase, further increasing extracellular K+.\nSo even though serum K+ can be normal or even paradoxically elevated, total body K+ is reduced. This is why it is especially important when treating DKA with insulin replacement, which reverses these mechanisms, to monitor K+ and be ready to supplement it if it falls below 5.3 mEq/L and maintain between 4 and 5 mEq/L. This will help prevent hypokalemia and fatal arrhythmias from intracellular shifting of potassium. If serum potassium is under 3.3, potassium chloride should be administered before insulin.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased arterial blood pH","explanation":"\nDKA manifests with metabolic acidosis, as indicated by this patient's decreased serum bicarbonate concentration, which leads to a decreased arterial blood pH (not increased). The insulin deficiency in DKA increases lipolysis, resulting in more free fatty acids. In the liver, free fatty acids are converted to ketones, two of which are acidic (acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid). The patient's low serum bicarbonate can be explained by the consumption of bicarbonate by these acidic ketones and leads to an elevated anion gap.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased total body sodium","explanation":"The insulin deficiency in DKA causes hyperglycemic hyperosmolarity, which results in a shift of water from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment and subsequently, dilutional hyponatremia. The hyperglycemia also results in osmotic diuresis, leading to a loss of water in excess of Na+, thereby counteracting the hyponatremia. However, there is still a net loss of Na+ via the urine, and therefore, the total body Na+ would be normal or decreased, rather than increased.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased arterial pCO2","explanation":"The metabolic acidosis which manifests with a high anion gap is a classic finding of DKA. In response to the acidosis, patients typically exhibit a deep and labored breathing pattern (Kussmaul breathing) for respiratory compensation. The higher depth and rate of breaths result in an increase in carbon dioxide exhalation and subsequently a decrease in arterial pCO2.","bool":false},{"option":"Serum glucose concentration of 650 mg/dL","explanation":"This is a tricky distractor since serum glucose concentration is indeed markedly increased in DKA due to insulin deficiency. But the serum glucose concentration rarely exceeds 600 mg/dL because ketogenesis (due to absolute insulin deficiency) usually begins at lower glucose levels and causes symptoms earlier. In contrast, another hyperglycemic crisis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) usually presents with serum glucose &gt; 600 mg/dL.\nWhen reviewing DKA and HHS, it can be easy to get them mixed up, so it is important to remember key differences. For example, HHS usually occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes as a result of relative insulin deficiency, enough to suppress lipolysis and resulting ketogenesis, rather than absolute deficiency. So these patients have normal to low ketone levels, a normal anion gap, and higher pH and bicarbonate values (often even normal). Compensatory Kussmaul breathing would also not be expected in HHS. See the “Comparison of DKA and HHS” table for further information.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypervolemia","explanation":"Patients with DKA typically present with hypovolemia and sometimes severe dehydration, rather than hypervolemia. In DKA, hyperglycemia, due to absolute insulin deficiency, leads to progressive volume depletion via osmotic diuresis. The increased diuresis, presenting as nocturnal enuresis and polydipsia in this patient, eventually leads to hypovolemia. This patient has dry mucous membranes, hypotension, and tachycardia, all of which are features of hypovolemia/dehydration.

The resulting hyponatremia causes the osmotic shift of fluid into cells, which may cause cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and, ultimately, confusion, lethargy, and seizures.

Pellagra, or niacin deficiency, is a possible complication of carcinoid syndrome. There is increased metabolism of serotonin in carcinoid tumors, which depletes tryptophan precursors available for other organic compounds, including niacin.\nPatients should undergo 24-hour urine testing for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the end product of serotonin metabolism. Imaging tests (e.g., CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis) are then used to localize and stage the tumor. The treatment of choice in patients with carcinoid syndrome is surgical resection of the tumor. In inoperable cases, somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide) can be given to relieve symptoms and prevent complications of the disease, including niacin deficiency.","bool":true},{"option":"T-cell lymphoma","explanation":"Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma is a complication of celiac disease (CD), along with ulcerative jejunitis and adenocarcinoma of the small bowel. Although the patient has had weight loss and diarrhea, he does not have the typical steatorrhea seen in CD.

These fistulas are the result of the chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and scarring of the intestinal walls. This patient has chronic diarrhea, episodic crampy abdominal pain, and associated weight loss. However, this patient does not have bloody or mucoid diarrhea, which is typically seen in inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, CD does not explain why the patient also presents with flushing, tricuspid murmur, and asthma.","bool":false},{"option":"Achlorhydria","explanation":"\nAchlorhydria is part of WDHA syndrome (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria), which is seen in VIPomas. The unregulated production of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) leads to excessive secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, causing WDHA syndrome. Cutaneous flushing is seen in about 20% of patients with VIPoma. However, this etiology does not explain why the patient also presents with a tricuspid murmur and asthma, neither of which is associated with VIPomas.","bool":false},{"option":"Megaloblastic anemia","explanation":"\nMegaloblastic anemia is usually due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency and is commonly associated with malnutrition or malabsorption. Folate deficiency can also be caused specifically by folate antagonists, and vitamin B12 deficiency can also be seen in pernicious anemia or after gastrectomy, neither of which would be the case in this patient. While malabsorption can occur in carcinoid syndrome, it is usually not severe enough to cause folate or B12 deficiency. Another complication is more likely to affect this patient.\nGastric carcinoid tumors can cause pernicious anemia.

Irregular menstrual cycles are likely due to the inhibitory effect of high circulating cortisol on gonadotropin release. Hyperglycemia is caused by cortisol stimulating gluconeogenesis, peripheral insulin resistance, and direct suppression of insulin release. Leukocytosis can occur as a result of demargination of neutrophils from vascular walls. Hypokalemia is due to the aldosterone-like effects of cortisol, which stimulates the excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions, causing metabolic alkalosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Polycystic ovarian syndrome","explanation":"\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by high levels of circulating androgens, which leads to virilization, obesity, acne, and hirsutism.

In addition, a tumor large enough to compress the hypothalamus would likely also impair the production of ACTH (resulting in hypocortisolism) and TSH (resulting in hypothyroidism), which are not affected in this patient.

Since a negative urine pregnancy test does not rule out early pregnancy (elevated HCG can only be detected about 10 days after the first missed period), this diagnosis is possible. However, breast discharge would be unlikely in this very early stage and this patient's headache and mass on MRI are more consistent with lactotrophic pituitary adenoma.","bool":false},{"option":"D","explanation":"\nPituitary adenomas are benign tumors that arise from the anterior pituitary gland and can produce hormones (secretory pituitary adenomas). Lactotrophic adenomas (prolactinomas) secrete prolactin, which can manifest with galactorrhea, as is the case here. Prolactin also stimulates the compensatory hypothalamic synthesis and secretion of its own inhibitory factor, dopamine, via a short-loop feedback mechanism. Moreover, prolactin inhibits GnRH secretion, thus causing a decrease in the release of FSH and LH. This leads to decreased serum estrogen and progesterone levels (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), which can manifest with menstrual irregularities and decreased libido.\nThe physiologic increase in dopamine (prolactin-inhibitory factor) is insufficient to counteract the excess release of prolactin from lactotroph adenomas. Dopamine agonists (e.g., cabergoline), which are the treatment of choice of prolactinomas, effectively decrease the release of prolactin from lactotroph cells and reduce the size of adenomas.","bool":true},{"option":"B","explanation":"An isolated increase in estrogen could be caused by a granulosa cell tumor, a low-grade malignant ovarian tumor that produces estrogen (but may produce progesterone as well) and most commonly affects postmenopausal women.

Which of the following responses by the kidney is most likely?","difficulty":1,"hint":"In renal hypoperfusion, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated, meaning the kidneys release renin, which leads to activation and release of angiotensin II and aldosterone.","answers":[{"option":"Increased sodium reabsorption","explanation":"Increased aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium and the secretion of potassium and protons in renal collecting tubules. In addition, angiotensin II increases the glomerular filtration rate and stimulates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. As sodium is reabsorbed, water follows from the glomerular filtrate into the renal interstitium. This fluid shift into the peritubular capillaries eventually leads to increased intravascular fluid and increased blood pressure.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased potassium excretion","explanation":"When the RAAS is activated, increased aldosterone will act at the collecting tubules of the nephron to increase potassium secretion. This effect would increase, rather than decrease, potassium excretion.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased proton excretion","explanation":"When the RAAS is activated, increased aldosterone will act at the collecting tubules of the nephron to increase proton secretion. This effect would increase, rather than decrease, proton excretion.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased urea reabsorption","explanation":"\nUrea reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule and the collecting duct, and is expected to be increased in hypovolemia. Volume loss causes increased levels of ADH, which induces the expression of urea transporters in the medullary collecting ducts, leading to an increase in urea reabsorption. Reabsorption of urea in the collecting ducts is essential to maintain the inner medullary osmotic gradient that allows for maximal retention of filtered water. Urea is also reabsorbed in the proximal tubule via diffusion through the solvent drag of other electrolytes. This mechanism is also increased in hypovolemic states because of increased urine concentration and interstitial electrolyte concentration.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased creatinine reabsorption","explanation":"Under physiological conditions, creatinine is removed from the blood by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion at a relatively constant rate. Although creatinine can be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract (dietary supplements or meat), there is little to no renal tubular reabsorption of creatinine. Because of decreased renal perfusion, this patient is at risk of decreased glomerular filtration and thus increased serum creatinine. However, any rise in serum creatinine is a result of decreased clearance (decreased GFR) rather than as a result of increased renal absorption.","bool":false}]},{"id":198,"info":"Endocrine System","question":"\nA 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician because menarche has not yet occurred.

Hyperandrogenism and disrupted LH/FSH balance, resulting in elevated LH:FSH ratio, impair follicle maturation, preventing ovulation and progesterone release from the corpus luteum. As a result, there is only estrogen-driven endometrial proliferation (proliferative phase) without a progesterone-driven secretory phase. Without regular shedding of the endometrium, the endometrium can become thick and unstable, resulting in irregular, heavy uterine bleeding, and/or primary amenorrhea. Furthermore, unopposed estrogen-driven endometrial proliferation increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and type 1 endometrial cancer.\nFirst-line treatment includes lifestyle modifications to treat obesity if applicable (goal BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2) and, for patients who do not wish to conceive, oral contraceptives to regulate menstrual periods, or, in patients who do wish to conceive, pharmacological induction of ovulation (e.g., with letrozole or clomiphene).","bool":true},{"option":"Imperforate hymen","explanation":"\nImperforate hymen can cause primary amenorrhea.

Although a pregnancy test should be performed in any sexually active female with amenorrhea, this patient's hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance suggest PCOS, which can cause chronic anovulation and infertility.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated serum cortisol levels","explanation":"Elevated serum cortisol levels would suggest Cushing syndrome, which can cause primary amenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, and insulin resistance. However, this patient does not have any other features of Cushing syndrome (e.g., striae, buffalo hump, central obesity with wasting of extremities, hypertension). Moreover, Cushing syndrome is a rarer cause of amenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, and insulin resistance than PCOS, and cortisol levels in PCOS are usually normal.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated serum prolactin levels","explanation":"Elevated serum prolactin levels (due to a prolactinoma) can inhibit Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, resulting in anovulation and amenorrhea.

Serum calcium concentration reflects the combination of both ionized and nonionized (protein-bound) calcium.","answers":[{"option":"Hypoalbuminemia","explanation":"\nNephrotic syndrome is associated with decreased serum albumin concentration secondary to urinary protein loss. Approximately 40% of serum calcium is usually bound to proteins, so hypoalbuminemia can significantly reduce the total serum calcium concentration.

This patient with anxiety, tremor, digital swelling, retraction of the eyelid, and irregular heartbeats most likely has hyperthyroidism. Thyroid hormones affect cardiac myocytes directly and also stimulate the proliferation of beta-adrenergic receptors, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias as seen in this patient. Beta blockers decrease the adrenergic tone and therefore reduce tachycardia, control hypertension, improve muscle weakness, tremor, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Propranolol, in high doses, also decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 by inhibiting the 5'-monodeiodinase enzyme. Thus, this patient should be started on a beta blocker, preferably propranolol, as soon as possible.","bool":true},{"option":"Diltiazem","explanation":"\nDiltiazem is classified as a class IV antiarrhythmic drug and is used to achieve rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), which is this patient's most likely arrhythmia. However, another therapeutic option is more commonly used and would also relieve thyrotoxic symptoms, such as tremor and anxiety.","bool":false},{"option":"Digoxin","explanation":"Main indications for digoxin treatment are atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure in treatment-resistant cases. Although this patient has an arrhythmia, which could be AF, it is accompanied by symptoms of thyrotoxicosis (tremor, anxiety, retraction of the eyelid). Hyperthyroid AF is usually resistant to the typical dose of digoxin, which requires a larger dose and thereby increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Moreover, digoxin does not provide relief from the other manifestations of adrenergic hyperstimulation.","bool":false},{"option":"Warfarin","explanation":"\nWarfarin is an oral anticoagulant. Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased risk of developing thromboembolic complications, which is why long-term anticoagulation is indicated when CHA2DS2-VASc score is ≥ 3 in women or when AF is caused by valvular disease. This patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score is 1 and although she presents with symptoms of AF (irregularly irregular pulse) and a systolic ejection murmur, her murmur is most likely due to the hyperdynamic circulation resulting from the increased adrenergic tone.","bool":false},{"option":"Propylthiouracil","explanation":"\nPropylthiouracil (PTU) is an antithyroid drug that is used in the medical treatment of hyperthyroidism, which this patient shows signs and symptoms of.

Moreover, this patient should receive immediate control of her symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Amiodarone","explanation":"\nAmiodarone is used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and persisting ventricular fibrillation after unsuccessful defibrillation, as well as the long-term treatment of refractory supraventricular arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation). Because of the high levels of iodine in amiodarone, it may aggravate preexisting thyroid conditions. In this patient, who shows symptoms of supraventricular arrhythmia (palpitations and irregularly irregular pulse) and hyperthyroidism (anxiety, tremor, digital swelling, and retraction of the eyelid), amiodarone should only be considered if other treatment options fail.","bool":false}]},{"id":207,"info":"Endocrine System","question":"A 73-year-old patient is evaluated in the hospital after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 5 minutes.

Renutrition and ensuing rising glucose concentrations cause insulin release, which leads to an intracellular shift of glucose, phosphorus (needed for phosphorylation of glucose in glycolysis), magnesium, and potassium. The resulting drops in serum electrolyte concentrations can cause severe complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. To prevent RS, energy intake should be increased gradually and serum electrolytes must be monitored closely and repleted as necessary.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased serum magnesium concentration","explanation":"\nHypermagnesemia can occur in the later stages of RS if rhabdomyolysis and ensuing renal failure develop. However, this patient's normal serum creatinine concentration, as well as mildly decreased creatinine kinase (due to malnutrition), exclude these conditions. Increased insulin release in patients with RS causes an intracellular shift of electrolytes. Therefore, a decreased, rather than increased serum magnesium concentration is expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased serum potassium concentration","explanation":"\nHyperkalemia may be seen in patients with RS due to significant myocyte damage caused by seizures or rhabdomyolysis. However, if significant myocyte damage were present, serum creatine kinase would be elevated. Increased insulin release in patients with RS activates the Na+/K+-ATPase, resulting in an intracellular shift of potassium and a decreased, rather than increased serum potassium concentration.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased serum ketoacid concentration","explanation":"Increased serum ketoacid concentration is seen in catabolic states such as diabetic ketoacidosis (due to insulin deficiency) or starvation ketoacidosis, both of which are associated with fatty acid breakdown. During renutrition, glucose-dependent metabolic pathways are increasingly activated. Since thiamine is a cofactor for these pathways, renutrition can lead to thiamine deficiency, which can result in lactic acidosis (because thiamine is also necessary for the conversion of lactate to pyruvate) but not ketoacidosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased serum insulin concentration","explanation":"Renutrition and ensuing rising glucose concentrations cause insulin release.

The clinical presentation is variable and includes features such as congenital heart defects, craniofacial abnormalities, cleft palate, and thymus/parathyroid aplasia or hypoplasia. Murmurs are attributable to structural heart disease and tetany arises from the hypocalcemia of hypoparathyroidism. This mother presents with signs and symptoms most concerning for maternal Graves disease, which is not associated with neonatal DiGeorge syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Macrosomia and shoulder dystocia","explanation":"\nMacrosomia and consequential shoulder dystocia in a neonate are most commonly seen in uncontrolled gestational diabetes mellitus. In diabetic mothers, chronic hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperinsulinemia and islet cell hyperplasia.

However, anaplastic thyroid cancer is not typically associated with symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Moreover, the rapidly enlarging neck mass of anaplastic thyroid cancer usually causes pain or compressive symptoms (e.g., hoarseness, dysphagia), which are not reported in this patient. Hashimoto thyroiditis, which is the most likely diagnosis, is associated with Hurthle cells and lymphocytic infiltrate with a germinal center on biopsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Diffusely increased uptake on a radioactive iodine scan","explanation":"In the case of Hashimoto thyroiditis, radioiodine uptake is highly variable and extremely nonspecific. While decreased radioiodine uptake has been reported in approx. 30% of patients, a diffusely increased radioiodine uptake would be more suggestive of Graves disease.

Addison disease can cause fatigue and hypotension, but it would be also manifest with cutaneous hyperpigmentation as a result of increased ACTH production. Myasthenia gravis (MG) can cause fatigue, but fatigue due to MG is classically worse in the evening or after activity and is associated with diplopia or ptosis. Graves disease can manifest with an anterior neck swelling (goiter), but it causes features of hyperthyroidism (e.g., tachycardia, moist skin, weight loss) rather than hypothyroidism.

This patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are concerning for adrenal crisis (acute adrenal insufficiency). Loss of negative feedback inhibition of cortisol at the pituitary gland stimulates the production of ACTH (and subsequently, MSH) from the normally functioning pituitary gland. The increase in MSH, which is cleaved from the same precursor peptide as ACTH, and the resulting hyperpigmentation are specific for primary adrenal insufficiency.\nIn an acute setting, the dose of glucocorticoids is usually high enough to ensure adequate mineralocorticoid receptor activation. In patients with chronic primary adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoids such as fludrocortisone should be added to the drug regimen.","bool":true},{"option":"Levothyroxine","explanation":"\nLevothyroxine is the treatment of choice for hypothyroidism. While fatigue, loss of energy, and decreased appetite are typical symptoms of hypothyroidism, patients usually present with constipation, weight gain, and, in some cases, hypertension.

Although active TB manifests with constitutional symptoms, such as fatigue and weight loss, it primarily affects the lung; bowel involvement (which could explain the patient's nausea and abdominal pain) is less common. However, TB is a common cause of Addison disease, especially in developing countries, and could explain this patient's symptoms. Therefore, after the appropriate treatment for adrenal insufficiency is begun, tuberculin skin test or interferon-γ release assay should be performed to rule out TB as the underlying cause.","bool":false},{"option":"Deferoxamine","explanation":"\nDeferoxamine is used in the treatment of acute iron toxicity and chronic iron toxicity. This patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis would be consistent with acute iron toxicity, but dark discoloration of the stool, as well as an increased anion gap, would also be expected. As for chronic iron toxicity (e.g., due to hemochromatosis), patients usually present with fatigue and a generalized, bronze skin discoloration, as seen in the patient. However, additional features, such as hepatomegaly, heart failure, arthralgia, and diabetes, would be expected.

The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is thyroid dysgenesis (i.e., thyroid hypoplasia, dysplasia, or aplasia). Early initiation of thyroxine supplementation is essential to prevent the patient from developing permanent intellectual disability. If the mother has clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism, the manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism may be apparent at birth; if the mother is euthyroid, the manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism develop a few weeks to months after birth because the placenta supplies the fetus with maternal thyroid hormone.

Toxic multinodular goiter is most commonly caused by chronic iodine deficiency, which decreases hormone production and thereby increases pituitary TSH secretion due to missing negative feedback. This leads to persistent stimulation of the thyroid gland, causing hyperplasia of thyroid nodules. In addition to the scintigraphy seen here, other characteristic findings include ↑ T3 and ↓ TSH.

This patient is hypertensive and hypokalemic, suggesting a different enzyme deficiency.","bool":false},{"option":"Progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone","explanation":"\n17α-hydroxylase converts progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone. 17α-hydroxylase deficiency causes insufficient androgen production. Female (XX) patients with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with normal female genitalia but experience delayed puberty because of low androgen production. Mineralocorticoid precursor hormones also build up, resulting in sodium retention (hypertension) and potassium wasting (hypokalemia). This genotypically female patient has ambiguous genitalia and thus does not have 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.","bool":false},{"option":"Testosterone to dihydrotestosterone","explanation":"\n5α-reductase converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is responsible for virilization of the genitalia. Patients with 5α-reductase deficiency are usually genotypically male (XY) and have female external genitalia at birth with intra-abdominal testicles. This genotypically female patient has virilized genitalia and thus does not have 5α-reductase deficiency.","bool":false},{"option":"Androstenedione to estrone","explanation":"\nAromatase converts androstenedione to estrone, and thus is responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Genotypically female (XX) patients with aromatase deficiency are born with ambiguous external genitalia but normal female internal genitalia. They experience primary amenorrhea and impaired maturation of secondary sex characteristics due to insufficient estrogen production. While this genotypically female patient does have ambiguous external genitalia, she also has electrolyte abnormalities that suggest a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.","bool":false}]},{"id":248,"info":"Endocrine System","question":"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the hospital because of blurred vision and headache for 3 months. During this period, the father noticed that the child has been tilting his head back to look straight ahead. The patient has also had difficulty falling asleep for 2 months. He has had a 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), pulse is 105/min, and blood pressure is 104/62 mm Hg. Examination shows equal pupils that are not reactive to light. The pupils constrict when an object is brought near the eye. His upward gaze is impaired; there is bilateral nystagmus and eyelid retraction while attempting to look upwards. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings. The remainder of the examination shows no other abnormalities. If left untreated, which of the following is the most likely sequela of this patient's condition?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient has vertical gaze palsy, nystagmus, eyelid retraction on looking upward (Collier sign), and pupils that accommodate but do not react to light, which suggests Parinaud syndrome. Additional symptoms of weight loss, headache, and insomnia raise suspicion for pinealoma.","answers":[{"option":"Hydrocephalus","explanation":"\nParinaud syndrome occurs in most patients with pinealomas and is caused by compression of the tectum and the medial longitudinal fasciculus, which together coordinate eye movements. If left untreated, a pinealoma may obstruct the passage of cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles to the subarachnoid space (e.g., via aqueductal stenosis) leading to obstructive hydrocephalus, a common sequela of pinealoma. Obstructive hydrocephalus typically manifests with headaches, vision abnormalities, nausea, vomiting, and impaired ambulation (e.g, ataxia) due to increased intracranial pressure.\nThe most common type of pinealoma in children is a pineal germinoma that typically secretes β-hCG, eventually leading to precocious puberty.","bool":true},{"option":"Leukocoria","explanation":"\nLeukocoria is a typical manifestation of retinoblastoma, which may cause nystagmus and loss of vision. However, the age of onset of retinoblastoma is typically &lt; 4 years and this patient does not have strabismus, which is the most common initial manifestation. Parinaud syndrome and insomnia are not typical features of retinoblastoma. Moreover, leukocoria is a clinical finding and not a sequela of any medical condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome","explanation":"\nOpsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is a paraneoplastic syndrome that may develop in individuals with neuroblastoma. While weight loss and ocular anomalies (e.g., proptosis) may be present in individuals with neuroblastoma, it does not cause vertical gaze palsy, nystagmus, or Collier sign. Also, this patient has no features suggesting neuroblastoma, such as abdominal distension, bone pain, and a palpable, firm, irregular abdominal mass that crosses the midline.","bool":false},{"option":"Pretibial myxedema","explanation":"\nPretibial myxedema is a sequela of Graves disease, which may manifest with weight loss, ocular symptoms (e.g., lid retraction), and insomnia. However, in contrast to this patient's ocular findings, Graves ophthalmopathy manifests with bilateral exophthalmos and conjunctival hyperemia, not with vertical gaze palsy. Moreover, this patient does not have other characteristic symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as excessive sweating, tachycardia, and diffuse goiter.","bool":false},{"option":"Growth failure","explanation":"\nGrowth failure can result from compression of the pituitary gland due to intrasellar extension of a craniopharyngioma. Headaches, caused by compression of the adjacent brain parenchyma and/or stretching of the dura mater, and visual field defects (e.g., bilateral hemianopia), resulting from compression of the optic chiasm, are common in this condition. This patient most likely has a pinealoma, which can compress the hypothalamic inhibiting pathways and subsequently increase hCG secretion, leading to precocious puberty rather than growth failure.","bool":false}]},{"id":249,"info":"Endocrine System","question":"\nA 17-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus comes to the emergency department because of nausea and abdominal pain during the past 6 hours.

DKA occurs when insulin deficiency stimulates lipolysis and increases the production of ketone bodies (e.g., acetoacetic acid) from free fatty acids. The presence of these inorganic acids lowers pH and increases the anion gap. In order to buffer these acidic ketones, HCO3- is consumed. To compensate for metabolic acidosis, minute ventilation increases and PaCO2 is lowered, resulting in an arterial blood gas pattern as seen here.","bool":true},{"option":"B","explanation":"Mildly increased pH with decreased PaCO2 and decreased HCO3- suggests a respiratory alkalosis that has been compensated for by decreased renal reabsorption of bicarbonate (chronic respiratory alkalosis).

The molecular pathogenesis of these changes involves intraocular sorbitol accumulation, which consumes NADPH and leads to oxidative stress. This oxidative stress ultimately leads to damage of the retinal microvasculature. The release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by dying cells promotes the neovascularization of the retina and optic disc that is characteristic of diabetic retinopathy.","bool":true},{"option":"Dry macular degeneration","explanation":"Dry macular degeneration is characterized by yellow deposits (drusen) on fundoscopy. Neovascularization, which is seen on this patient's fundoscopic image, would not be expected in dry macular degeneration.","bool":false},{"option":"Open-angle glaucoma","explanation":"Open-angle glaucoma manifests with optic disc atrophy, notching of the neuroretinal rim, and disc hemorrhages on fundoscopy. These changes are caused by impaired absorption of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork and chronic increase in intraocular pressure. Patients typically present with chronic peripheral field deficits but retained central visual acuity. Neovascularization of the retina, which is seen in this patient, would not be expected in glaucoma.","bool":false},{"option":"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension","explanation":"\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension manifests with blurred optic disc margins (papilledema) and small hemorrhages on fundoscopy.

Typical fundoscopic exam findings include a pale retina and a so-called “cherry red spot” in the fovea. Neovascularization and tortuous vessels, which are seen on this patient's fundoscopic image, would not be expected in a central retinal artery occlusion.","bool":false},{"option":"Retinal detachment","explanation":"A retinal detachment typically presents with unilateral, acutely decreased vision with prominent floaters and fundoscopy would be expected to show a region of crinkled retinal tissue in the detached area.
