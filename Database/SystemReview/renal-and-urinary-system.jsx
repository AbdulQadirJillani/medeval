Eight months ago, he presented with a 6-month history of increased urinary frequency, difficulty to initiate urination, and straining to maintain the urinary stream. Digital rectal examination showed a symmetrically enlarged, nontender prostate with a rubbery texture. Laboratory studies showed a prostate-specific antigen level of 2.1 ng/mL. Abdominal ultrasound showed a post-void residual urine volume of 250 mL and bladder wall thickening. The patient received appropriate treatment. His vital signs are within normal limits. Laboratory studies today show a PSA level of 0.9 ng/mL. Which of the following medications was most likely used to treat this patient?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This older patient received treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as indicated by his original presentation with urinary frequency, hesitancy and straining, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings (enlarged, nontender rubbery prostate), and increased post-void residual volume (PRV). There are several therapy options for BPH, but one agent group in particular can decrease prostate size and, consequently, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.","answers":[{"option":"Dutasteride","explanation":"\nFive-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) like dutasteride are indicated in patients with BPH who present with evidence of prostate enlargement (&gt; 30 mL on imaging), a palpable prostate enlargement on DRE, and/or PSA &gt; 1.5 ng/dL. These agents prevent the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, decreasing the size of the prostate and providing symptomatic relief as well as reducing the risk of acute urinary retention and the need for prostatic surgery. Patients usually experience symptomatic relief and a reduction in serum PSA (∼ 50% decrease) after 6 months of using 5-ARIs.\nPSA levels must be interpreted with the proper correction factor when screening for prostate cancer in patients who have been treated with 5-ARIs because of the associated PSA level decrease.","bool":true},{"option":"Flutamide","explanation":"The antiandrogen drug flutamide is primarily a component of androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer. It is associated with a high risk of toxicity and adverse effects and is not routinely used in the management of BPH.","bool":false},{"option":"Terazosin","explanation":"\nAlpha-blockers such as terazosin are the first-line pharmacotherapy in symptomatic patients with moderate to severe BPH. These agents are smooth muscle relaxants that decrease the resistance to urinary outflow by causing smooth muscle relaxation in the bladder neck and the urethra, thereby improving symptoms in patients with BPH. However, alpha-blockers have little to no effect on prostate growth and thus PSA levels.","bool":false},{"option":"Oxybutynin","explanation":"\nAntimuscarinic agents such as oxybutynin are used to treat the irritative symptoms of BPH (e.g., urinary urgency and urinary frequency), which are due to detrusor overactivity. By blocking the muscarinic receptors, these agents cause relaxation of the detrusor muscle within the bladder and increase the risk of urinary retention, which explains why they are contraindicated in patients with significant PRV, as seen here. Regardless, antimuscarinic agents have no effect on prostate growth and thus PSA levels.","bool":false},{"option":"Tadalafil","explanation":"\nPhosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (e.g., tadalafil), which are primarily used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, may also be used to treat mild/moderate BPH with or without erectile dysfunction.

The membranous portion of the posterior urethra is most susceptible to injury from high-risk pelvic fractures. Therefore, this patient's history of trauma and x-ray findings (fractures of all four pubic rami) are consistent with a torn posterior urethra.

Patients who do not tolerate ACE inhibitors are usually started on an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.","answers":[{"option":"E","explanation":"\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists (e.g., losartan, valsartan, candesartan) inhibit angiotensin II receptors (AT1 receptors). Angiotensin II mediates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, vasoconstriction, and aldosterone release. Blocking of angiotensin II receptors, therefore, leads to an increase in urinary sodium excretion, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, and lower levels of aldosterone. The combination of these effects lowers blood pressure. To compensate for decreased sodium and water reabsorption, the juxtaglomerular apparatus will release more renin, which will subsequently increase the levels of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Meanwhile, bradykinin levels are not affected, as ARBs have no effect on ACE, which metabolizes bradykinin. Therefore, ARBs do not cause a dry cough as a side effect.","bool":true},{"option":"D","explanation":"This combination of effects could be explained by treatment with vasodilators such as hydralazine and alpha-1 blockers (e.g., doxazosin), which directly decrease peripheral vessel tone, resulting in lower blood pressure.

Decreased renal perfusion in renal artery stenosis activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which causes efferent arteriole constriction and increased sodium and water retention. This autoregulatory process maintains glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and GFR, but the increased elimination of potassium (due to aldosterone) results in hypokalemia, while systemic vasoconstriction due to angiotensin II and Na+/H2O retention results in hypertension. The administration of ACE inhibitors in patients with renal artery stenosis, especially those with bilateral stenosis, inhibits the autoregulatory mechanism (i.e., the efferent arteriole can no longer constrict), which may result in a decrease in GFR and an increase in creatinine, as seen here. Renal dysfunction can often be reversed by promptly discontinuing the agent. This patient's diuretic use (hydrochlorothiazide) has also contributed to a decrease in glomerular filtration pressure and GFR.\nImaging is required to confirm the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.

The pain radiates to the ipsilateral lower abdomen, groin, testicles (or labia majora in women), and perineum (typically T10–S4 dermatomes) as the stone migrates from the renal pelvis through the ureter. Occasionally, on abdominal palpation, there is also mild tenderness in the vicinity of the stone. The pain of renal colic increases steadily, typically reaches maximum intensity within 1–2 hours, and then plateaus until the stone leaves the ureter (usually after another few hours) or is removed. Although intermittent pain exacerbations (lasting several minutes) can occur as a result of ureteral peristalsis, the term renal “colic” is considered a misnomer because the pain does not cease completely in between exacerbations as it often does with intestinal colic. The passage of the stone into the bladder characteristically results in rapid relief from pain. The two episodes of renal colic in this patient resulted from two different ureteral stones; recurrence of urolithiasis is common.\nDepending on the location of the stone, urolithiasis may resemble conditions such as appendicitis or testicular torsion.

Nausea and vomiting are reflexive responses to severe pain.","answers":[{"option":"Noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis","explanation":"A noncontrast CT scan (NCCT) of the abdomen and pelvis is the gold standard diagnostic exam for most adult patients with the first instance of sudden flank pain as it has a sensitivity and specificity of &gt; 95% for the diagnosis of renal and ureteric stones. NCCT demonstrates the calculus location, size, density, and degree of obstruction (hydronephrosis); nearly all stones are radiopaque on NCCT. Renal ultrasonography (USG) with an x-ray of the kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) is not as sensitive as NCCT, especially for small stones. However, since most small stones are passed spontaneously, the combination of renal USG and KUB x-ray is a reasonable and cheaper initial imaging protocol to detect large stones (i.e., ones that might require removal) when NCCT is not available. In patients in whom radiation exposure should be minimized (e.g., children, pregnant patients), renal USG alone is the imaging modality of choice. In recent years, reduced-radiation NCCT has become available and can be safely used in children. NCCT also has the advantage of being able to detect atypical causes of flank pain such as diverticulitis and appendicitis.\nA contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the abdomen and pelvis is only indicated when the initial NCCT cannot clearly differentiate between phleboliths and a stone. A CECT is also indicated when delineation of the urinary tract is required, as is the case with complex stones or patients with atypical anatomy (e.g., horseshoe kidney, transplanted kidney).","bool":true},{"option":"Ultrasound of the bladder and kidneys","explanation":"\nUltrasound of the bladder and kidneys alone can be used as an initial imaging test for patients in whom radiation exposure should be minimized (e.g., in children, pregnancy). Moreover, because ultrasonography of the kidney has a high sensitivity to detect hydronephrosis, it is also used in the emergency department in patients with a known history of stone disease and recurrent flank pain in order to minimize cumulative radiation exposure. In most adult patients with the first instance of flank pain from suspected stone disease, such as this woman, radiation exposure from imaging is not a significant concern and a different imaging modality is preferred. Ultrasonography alone has a relatively low sensitivity for stone detection, especially for small stones and distal ureteric stones.","bool":false},{"option":"X-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder","explanation":"\nX-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) alone is not used for the initial diagnosis of nephrolithiasis because it has poor sensitivity in detecting very small stones and stones composed of cystine or uric acid (radiolucent on x-ray).

Massive proteinuria (&gt; 3.5 g/24 h) results in low serum albumin, which reduces capillary oncotic pressure, thereby causing edema secondary to fluid leaking into tissue. Consequently, the liver increases all synthetic activity (involving albumin as well as other macromolecules, such as lipids) to compensate. Some of these excess lipids are reabsorbed by the proximal tubular epithelial cells. Once the cytoplasm becomes engorged, chunks of the cell can slough off into the tubular lumen, leading to the classic fatty casts on urinary sediment.\nPatients with nephrotic syndrome are at high risk of developing infections (due to urinary loss of IgG), hypocalcemia (due to vitamin D deficiency), and venous thrombus formation (due to urinary loss of antithrombin III and loss of fluid into the extravascular space).","bool":true},{"option":"RBC casts","explanation":"\nRed blood cells in urinary sediment are always abnormal. Their presence indicates glomerulonephritis (GN) and is caused by the congregation of proteins and RBCs inside the tubules. In this patient, GN might be secondary to his throat infection (poststreptococcal GN).

This male newborn has hereditary nephrogenic DI, most commonly caused by an X-linked mutation in the vasopressin V2 receptor gene (AVPR2), which results in the failure of principal cells to respond to vasopressin (ADH). Females with a heterozygous mutation are typically asymptomatic because of the presence of a functional gene and lyonization of the mutated gene. However, they may develop polyuria during pregnancy, as seen in this neonate's mother, because of increased clearance of vasopressin by placental vasopressinase. In contrast, males with the mutation present with severe symptoms soon after birth.\nOther therapeutic measures to treat nephrogenic DI are adequate hydration, dietary salt and protein restriction (to prevent solute diuresis), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) therapy.

The pudendal nerve, which originates from the S2–S4 spinal cord roots, innervates the external urethral sphincter and plays a role in maintaining continence. Stress incontinence is caused by impaired pelvic floor support, which can result from chronically elevated intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., due to a chronic cough, obesity) or from direct trauma to the levator ani muscle or nerve roots. Multiparous women are at a higher risk of such direct trauma, as it is usually caused by complications during delivery. Rarely, it can be caused by intrinsic sphincter defects resulting from scarring after surgery.","bool":true},{"option":"S1-S2 nerve roots","explanation":"The S1–S2 nerve roots give rise to the inferior gluteal nerve, which innervates the gluteus maximus muscle. Motor innervation to the piriformis muscle also originates from the same sacral roots. Both muscles are involved in hip extension and external rotation.

This patient has sustained a fracture of the posterior aspect of the left 12th rib as is evident from the tenderness over his back and the x-ray findings, which makes a kidney laceration the most likely associated injury.\nLeft lower rib fractures also commonly cause splenic injury (including splenic rupture) due to the proximity of the posterior surface of the spleen to the left 9th, 10th, and 11th ribs. Splenic injury is more common than kidney injury.","bool":true},{"option":"Liver hematoma","explanation":"The liver lies in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen deep to the 5th–12th ribs.

Renal papillary necrosis (RPN) is a potentially life-threatening complication of severe PN, which is caused by ascending bacterial infections of the bladder with organisms such as Escherichia coli and other enteric flora. RPN can result from any condition associated with ischemia; more than 50% of patients with RPN have more than one underlying cause, which is also the case here. This patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and PN, both of which can lead to RPN independently. If these conditions are concurrent, type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the progression of PN to RPN. The most common urinalysis findings for RPN include gross hematuria without RBC casts, proteinuria, and pyuria, all of which are seen here.\nAcute PN causes purulent inflammation of the interstitium resulting in the destruction of the renal parenchyma, the renal tubules, and, in some cases, the renal pelvis. Hematuria may be seen in PN without other complications but would be rather microscopic than macroscopic in these cases.","bool":true},{"option":"Renal tubules","explanation":"Acute PN causes edema and neutrophilic inflammation of the renal tubules, which can result in tubular destruction. Gross hematuria originating from the renal tubules, however, is not an expected feature of PN. Instead, tubular inflammation in PN leads to the formation of parenchymal microabscesses while glomeruli and blood vessels are spared. Luminal granulocytes form WBC casts, which then become visible on urinalysis, as seen here. Although the complication seen in this patient with PN can also affect the renal tubules, they are not the main source of hematuria in this condition. Moreover, granular casts on urinalysis are a characteristic feature of acute tubular necrosis, which is not usually caused by PN.","bool":false},{"option":"Renal glomerular basement membrane","explanation":"Damage to the renal glomerular basement membrane is most commonly caused by autoimmune diseases such as Goodpasture syndrome.

Massive proteinuria (&gt; 3.5 g/24 h) results in low serum albumin, leading to reduced capillary oncotic pressure, thereby causing edema secondary to fluid leaking into tissue. Consequently, the liver increases all synthetic activity (involving albumin as well as other macromolecules, such as lipids) to compensate. Some of these excess lipids are reabsorbed by the proximal tubular epithelial cells. Once the cytoplasm becomes engorged, chunks of the cell can slough off into the tubular lumen, leading to the classic fatty casts on urinary sediment.\nPatients with nephrotic syndrome are at high risk of developing infections (due to urinary loss of IgG), hypocalcemia (due to vitamin D deficiency), and venous thrombus formation (due to urinary loss of antithrombin III and loss of fluid into the extravascular space).","bool":true},{"option":"Epithelial casts","explanation":"\nEpithelial casts in the urine sediment are the result of a process that causes necrosis of the renal tubule epithelium.

They are commonly seen in healthy individuals who have recently exercised vigorously or been dehydrated.","bool":false},{"option":"RBC casts","explanation":"\nRed blood cells in urinary sediment are always abnormal. Their presence indicates glomerulonephritis (GN) and is caused by the congregation of proteins and RBCs inside the tubules.

The urachus is an embryonic structure that allows free communication between the bladder and yolk sac, facilitating early drainage of the urinary bladder. It normally involutes in utero to form the median umbilical ligament. Failure of involution results in congenital urachal abnormalities, including patent urachus, in which urine flowing through the still open urachus causes swelling of and leakage from the umbilicus, as seen here.\nOther urachal abnormalities include urachal cysts and vesicourachal diverticula. Neither of these, however, typically present with leakage of urine from the umbilicus.","bool":true},{"option":"Failed closure of the vitelline duct","explanation":"Complete failure of the vitelline duct to obliterate would lead to a vitelline fistula.

The result is a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a low urine pH. Moreover, hypoaldosteronism causes persistent sodium secretion and decreased potassium excretion, which leads to decreased ammonia secretion in the proximal convoluted tubule. Although fatigue and nausea can be seen in type 4 RTA, it classically also causes palpitations or chest pain, not fruity breath or dehydration as seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"E","explanation":"This urinalysis reflects a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis induced by vomiting. Volume contraction during the initial phase of vomiting prevents urine bicarbonate excretion, which lowers the urinary pH and decreases the need for ammonia buffer.

Patients with an acute spinal cord injury (SCI) can have spinal shock, which is a combination of decreased sensation, flaccid paralysis, and autonomic dysfunction below the level of an SCI. Autonomic dysfunction results in parasympathetic inactivation and a consequent atonic bladder. Patients with SCI become unaware of bladder filling and feel no urge to void, resulting in an overfilled and overdistended bladder that is palpable in the suprapubic region. When intravesical pressure rises above bladder outlet resistance, involuntary dribbling of urine occurs. SCI at or below the sacral micturition center can also cause overflow incontinence due to damage to the lower motor neurons that form part of the micturition reflex arc. Urinary retention in patients with an atonic bladder is best managed by clean intermittent catheterization.\nAnother cause of overflow incontinence is bladder outflow obstruction (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia in men or pelvic organ prolapse and uterine fibroids in women).

Because the uterine arteries are ligated during a hysterectomy, the ureters are at risk of being injured. The ureters are also susceptible to injury during ovarian surgeries (e.g., oophorectomy) as they lie below the infundibulopelvic ligament, which contains the ovarian arteries. Although any abdominopelvic surgery is a risk factor for ureteric injuries, hysterectomies are the most frequent cause.","bool":true},{"option":"Appendectomy","explanation":"The appendix lies in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, in close proximity to the cecum, ileum, and psoas and obturator muscles. The free portion of the appendix may assume a variety of positions, and in the pelvic position, lies in close proximity to the right ureter. However, the retrocecal position is much more common and the ureter is rarely injured during an appendectomy. A different procedure is more likely to have resulted in this patient's symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Cesarean delivery","explanation":"A cesarean section is performed by opening the anterior abdominal wall and making a low transverse incision on the anterior wall of the uterus. Although the ureters are in close proximity to the lateral walls of the uterus in a non-gravid state, they are pushed laterally as the uterus enlarges during pregnancy. This makes them less susceptible to injury during a cesarean section.","bool":false},{"option":"Foley catheter insertion","explanation":"A Foley catheter is usually inserted into the bladder through the urethra (in rare cases through the anterior abdominal wall in suprapubic catheterization) and can therefore potentially damage the urethral mucosa (not the ureter), resulting in a urethral stricture as it heals.

The injured nerve is part of the autonomic nervous system.\n","answers":[{"option":"Pelvic splanchnic nerves","explanation":"\nPelvic splanchnic nerves originate from the sacral nerve roots S2–S4 and provide parasympathetic innervation to the rectum, erectile tissue, and detrusor muscle of the bladder. Injury to these nerves (e.g., due to pelvic trauma, as seen in this patient) causes decreased activity of the detrusor muscle, which results in impaired bladder contractility (atonic bladder), overdistention, and decreased sensation of bladder fullness. The resulting overflow incontinence typically manifests with involuntary loss of urine in the form of constant dribbling.","bool":true},{"option":"Femoral nerve","explanation":"\nFemoral nerve injury can also occur as a result of pelvic trauma.

As type IV collagen is a component of basement membranes, and α3 subunits are only present in certain tissues (e.g., lung or kidney tissue), the autoantibodies in Goodpasture syndrome specifically damage the glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM antibodies) and the alveolar basement membrane. The absence of features of systemic vasculitis (e.g., purpura, livedo reticularis) helps differentiate Goodpasture syndrome from other causes of pulmonary-renal syndrome (see “Differential diagnosis of pulmonary-renal syndromes” table).\nTreatment of Goodpasture syndrome consists of plasmapheresis (to eliminate anti-GBM antibodies) and immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids).","bool":true},{"option":"Serum IgA titers","explanation":"Increased serum IgA levels can be seen in approximately half of all patients with IgA nephropathy or IgA vasculitis. Both these conditions can cause nephritic syndrome. Features of a pulmonary pathology (e.g., cough, dyspnea, crackles, infiltrates on chest x-ray) may also be present because respiratory infections such as pneumonia can be triggers for IgA nephropathy or IgA vasculitis.

A CT scan of the abdomen shows numerous intra-abdominal adhesions, as well as dilatation of the renal pelvis and proximal ureters bilaterally. An increase in which of following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's renal dysfunction?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient has bilateral hydronephrosis secondary to post-surgical adhesions.","answers":[{"option":"Hydrostatic pressure in the tubules","explanation":"In this patient, bilateral occlusion of the urinary system due to post-surgical adhesions increases intraluminal ureteral pressure, which leads to increased hydrostatic pressure in the renal tubules and Bowman capsule. Because the glomerular hydrostatic pressure is unable to overcome this increase in the tubular hydrostatic pressure there is a reduction in the net glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as manifested by this patient's elevated serum creatinine. Sustained elevation of intratubular pressure can cause compression of surrounding renal blood vessels, which ultimately can lead to ischemic tubular atrophy, thinning of the renal cortex and medulla, and irreversible loss of renal function.","bool":true},{"option":"Osmotic pressure in the glomeruli","explanation":"Increased osmotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries would oppose the net flow of water across the capillary walls, leading to a decrease in GFR. However, osmotic pressure in the glomeruli is driven by osmotically-active solute concentration, which remains unchanged in hydronephrosis. Therefore, this cannot be the primary mechanism of renal dysfunction in hydronephrosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Hydrostatic pressure in the efferent arteriole","explanation":"\nHydrostatic pressure in the efferent arteriole is primarily driven by the muscle tone of the efferent arterioles (which is predominantly regulated by RAAS). Vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles reduces the renal plasma flow but increases the glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction by increasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure. In this patient, however, elevated serum creatinine concentration suggests renal dysfunction with a reduced glomerular filtration rate.","bool":false},{"option":"Osmotic pressure in the afferent arteriole","explanation":"An increase in osmotic pressure in the afferent arteriole would cause a decrease in the net flow of water across the capillary walls into the afferent arteriole. Based on the Starling equation, an increase in the osmotic pressure in the afferent arteriole would lead to a net decrease in GFR. However, this is not the mechanism behind the decrease in GFR seen with hydronephrosis, in which the solute concentration of the blood remains unchanged.","bool":false},{"option":"Osmotic pressure in the tubules","explanation":"\nOsmotic pressure in the tubules is regulated by osmotically active solutes such as sodium and urea. Increased osmotic drive towards the inside of tubules can be observed after the administration of osmotically-active substances (e.g., mannitol). Hydronephrosis can lead to changes in the ability of the tubules to secrete and absorb solutes, but this is not the primary mechanism for the renal dysfunction seen with hydronephrosis.","bool":false}]},{"id":131,"info":"Renal and Urinary System","question":"A 64-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of progressively worsening back pain that wakes him up at night.

Treatment with which of the following drugs was most likely initiated in this patient?","difficulty":3,"hint":"When administered continuously, this drug can be used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. When administered in a pulsatile fashion, it can be used to treat infertility in women.","answers":[{"option":"Leuprolide","explanation":"\nLeuprolide is a long-acting GnRH agonist that is commonly used to treat androgen-sensitive prostate cancer. When administered continuously, it causes downregulation of the GnRH receptor in the pituitary, with a subsequent decrease in FSH and LH secretion. This manifests as an initial increase in serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels during the first few weeks of therapy, secondary to transiently increased gonadotropins, followed by a sustained decrease in both hormones.\nThe initial increase in serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone may stimulate prostate cancer growth and, as a consequence, worsen symptoms. To prevent a transient flare of prostate cancer-related symptoms, GnRH agonists are usually combined with antiandrogens like flutamide or bicalutamide, which counteract the effects of elevated androgen levels.","bool":true},{"option":"Finasteride","explanation":"\nFinasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and is commonly used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia. Lower levels of DHT leads to decreased prostatic growth and increased prostatic apoptosis. The use of finasteride could cause an increase in serum testosterone levels (because it causes less testosterone to be converted to DHT), but it would not explain the concurrent increase in DHT seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Ketoconazole","explanation":"\nKetoconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits adrenal androgen synthesis and has direct cytotoxic effects on prostate cancer cells. However, it would not cause an initial increase in the levels of serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, as seen in this patient. In fact, serum testosterone levels would decline rapidly within the first 24 hours of initiating the therapy.","bool":false},{"option":"Flutamide","explanation":"\nFlutamide is a non-steroidal antiandrogenic drug that competitively inhibits testosterone and dihydrotestosterone binding at the androgen-receptor complex. Flutamide would be expected to cause a sustained increase in the serum testosterone level, due to the inhibition of the negative feedback of testosterone on the hypothalamus and pituitary. This patient's initial increase and subsequent decrease of testosterone is not consistent with flutamide use.","bool":false},{"option":"Anastrozole","explanation":"\nAnastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that is used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient's urinary frequency and hesitancy in combination with an enlarged, nontender, prostate without any irregularities on digital rectal examination (DRE) and an increased postvoid residual volume suggest benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).","answers":[{"option":"Terazosin therapy","explanation":"\nAlpha-blockers (e.g., terazosin, tamsulosin, doxazosin) are the first-line pharmacotherapy in most patients with symptomatic BPH and decreased quality of life. Alpha-blockers are smooth muscle relaxants, which decrease the resistance to urinary outflow by causing smooth muscle relaxation of the bladder neck and the urethra, thereby causing a symptomatic improvement in patients with BPH. Alpha-blockers do not reverse prostatic hyperplasia, but they can provide rapid improvement of symptoms.\nOrthostatic hypotension (due to vascular smooth muscle relaxation) is a common adverse effect of alpha-blockers. Terazosin and doxazosin are also FDA-approved to treat BPH in patients with concomitant hypertension, like in this patient.","bool":true},{"option":"Finasteride therapy","explanation":"\nFive-alpha-reductase inhibitors like finasteride are recommended as first-line treatment in patients with uncomplicated BPH who have a large prostate, as indicated sonographically (prostate volume &gt; 40 mL) or based on a PSA concentration (&gt; 1.5 ng/mL). Five-alpha-reductase inhibitors prevent the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which decreases the size of the prostate, causing symptomatic relief, while reducing the risk of acute urinary retention and the need for prostatic surgery. However, symptomatic improvement is seen only after at least 6 months of five-alpha-reductase inhibitor use. Long-term use can cause sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, impotence, ejaculatory dysfunction) and gynecomastia in some patients.","bool":false},{"option":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","explanation":"\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is indicated in patients with persistent symptoms despite pharmacotherapy or in patients who develop complications due to BPH, such as acute urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, or hydronephrosis.

Although this patient presents with urinary frequency and symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction (e.g., hesitancy, weak stream, elevated residual bladder volume), digital rectal examination and ultrasound suggest that the cause of this patient's symptoms is BPH. Cystoscopy is not routinely performed in the evaluation of BPH. If this patient presented with gross or microscopic hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, or a history of prior transurethral intervention that might suggest he has a urethral stricture, cystoscopy should be performed.","bool":false},{"option":"Bladder catheterization","explanation":"\nBladder catheterization (either transurethral or suprapubic) is indicated in acute urinary retention (AUR), a common complication of BPH. Although this patient presents with features of bladder outflow obstruction due to prostatic enlargement (e.g., poor stream, hesitancy), he does not complain of suprapubic or pelvic pain, or a complete inability to pass urine or have a bladder that is palpable on physical examination, all of which are features of AUR.","bool":false},{"option":"Prostate biopsy","explanation":"\nProstate biopsy is indicated when there is a suspicion of prostate cancer, such as an elevation of serum prostate-specific antigen &gt; 4 ng/ml and/or DRE findings of palpable nodules, indurated segments, and asymmetrical enlargement of the prostate gland. Because prostate biopsy is an invasive procedure and can cause serious complications (e.g., hemorrhage, genitourinary infection, acute urinary retention), it is not routinely performed in patients with prostatic complaints unless there is a strong suspicion for prostate cancer. Since this patient had a normal prostate-specific antigen and his rectal examination was unremarkable, a prostate biopsy is not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Prostatectomy","explanation":"\nProstatectomy is very rarely indicated in patients with BPH due to the availability of effective pharmacotherapy and minimally invasive surgical procedures for patients who require surgery.

Moreover, oligohydramnios can affect the development of the fetal lung resulting in lung hypoplasia, which is the most likely cause of this patient's cyanosis and hypoxia.\nOnce the vital functions have been stabilized, temporary insertion of a urinary catheter can relieve the UTO and allow for correction of possible electrolyte imbalances. Definitive treatment of PUV is either primary valve ablation during cystoscopy (first-line) or vesicostomy (in preterm boys or if ablation is not possible).","bool":true},{"option":"X-ray of the chest","explanation":"In patients with Potter sequence, chest x-ray may reveal pulmonary hypoplasia as the cause of this patient's respiratory distress, but it does not reveal the underlying mechanism of the condition. Chest x-ray is used, however, for diagnosing infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and meconium aspiration. IRDS manifests most frequently in preterm infants, usually immediately after birth, with signs of increased breathing effort, hypoxia, cyanosis, and decreased breath sounds on auscultation. However, the additional clinical features seen in this neonate (e.g., craniofacial dysmorphism, limb abnormalities, and hydronephrosis) could not be explained by this diagnosis. Meconium aspiration syndrome manifests with respiratory distress or unresponsiveness usually in postterm rather than preterm infants. Furthermore, the absence of a green amniotic fluid makes the diagnosis unlikely in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Karyotyping","explanation":"\nKaryotyping confirms chromosomal abnormalities, which are frequently associated with dysmorphic facial and limb abnormalities.

Adequate volume repletion before and during the administration of acyclovir is effective in preventing crystal-induced AKI.\nOther frequent causes of crystal-induced AKI include ethylene glycol, protease inhibitors (especially indinavir and atazanavir), methotrexate, sulfonamides, or high doses of vitamin C. The offending agent should be discontinued and IV fluids administered to improve excretion and prevent further obstruction of the tubules. Crystal-induced AKI generally has a good prognosis.","bool":true},{"option":"Ureteropelvic junction obstruction","explanation":"\nUreteropelvic junction obstruction can be either acquired or congenital, and while patients with this form of obstruction are prone to hydronephrosis and/or recurrent pyelonephritis that can also manifest with colicky flank pain, this condition typically manifests earlier in life. Furthermore, urinary obstruction would show a BUN:creatinine ratio of &gt; 10–20:1, indicating post-renal failure.

During the procedure, an electrocautery-resectoscope is used to remove all visible neoplastic tissue up to the muscular layer of the bladder. Because of the possibility of multifocal CIS, areas of bladder mucosa that appear normal should also be biopsied during TURBT. To minimize the high risk of recurrence of urothelial CIS (due to tumor cell reimplantation), following TURBT, adjuvant intravesical instillation of antineoplastic drugs (e.g., mitomycin) or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin is often performed (especially for high-grade tumors). Patients should subsequently undergo periodic surveillance using cystoscopy and urine cytology.\nNeoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (with a cisplatin-based regimen) followed by radical cystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with muscle-invasive UBC who are candidates for curative surgery (stage II or III disease) and willing to undergo the subsequent urinary diversion procedure.

Immunohistochemistry would show glomerular immune complex deposition in patients with lupus nephritis. In this condition, renal damage is mediated by autoantibodies targeted against nuclear antigens (e.g., anti-dsDNA), which form immune complexes that are deposited in the glomerular mesangial, subendothelial, and subepithelial spaces. These depositions lead to intrarenal complement activation, which results in proliferation and thickening of the mesangium, the capillary walls, and/or glomerular basement membrane. The histopathological changes in lupus nephritis resemble those of membranous nephropathy, diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, and, in severe cases, crescentic glomerulonephritis. The levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies correlate with the severity of lupus nephritis.

The tumor is most commonly an incidental finding on exam, without other signs or symptoms, but may manifest with abdominal pain and hypertension. Laboratory analysis should include a urinalysis, which typically shows hematuria. The best initial diagnostic test is an abdominal ultrasound, which can distinguish nephroblastoma from other abdominal tumors, showing a kidney mass of mostly uniform echogenicity with hypoechoic areas of necrosis. Abdominal CT or MRI is performed to assess the extent of involvement and to help with surgical planning.","bool":true},{"option":"Ovarian cyst","explanation":"\nOvarian cysts can occasionally grow very large and may even be palpable as a unilateral lower abdominal and/or pelvic mass, which is often associated with lower abdominal pain.

Additionally, more than 50% of pediatric gastrointestinal lymphomas arise in the ileocecal region, manifesting as an RLQ mass. While lymphoma cannot be entirely excluded in this patient solely based on the findings presented, it is not the most likely cause of an abdominal mass in this 4-year-old girl.","bool":false},{"option":"Polycystic kidney disease","explanation":"\nPolycystic kidney disease (PKD) may manifest in some cases as a palpable abdominal mass or a protruding abdomen due to renal enlargement. Cystic diseases of the kidneys account for ∼ 5% of all palpable abdominal masses in children.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is also used to detect renal masses, for which the patient is at risk given his family history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RCC can also cause fatigue (due to anemia).

Physical examination may show a palpable bladder with dullness to percussion and patients may complain of abdominal pain and fullness. Because these features are not always present in the early stages of POUR, a bedside bladder ultrasound scan is the most appropriate modality to quickly assess the volume of the bladder. If the patient was catheterized preoperatively, treatment includes checking the catheter for kinking or blocks. If the patient was not catheterized, a trial of voiding and/or optimization of analgesia with NSAIDs should be attempted.

Which of the following factors has most likely contributed most to this patient’s current condition?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Envelope-shaped crystals on urinalysis indicate calcium oxalate crystals.","answers":[{"option":"Malabsorption of fatty acids","explanation":"\nMalabsorption of fatty acids due to deficiency in bile acids is common in patients with Crohn disease (and/or short bowel syndrome) and likely explains this patient's nephrolithiasis. In the intestinal lumen, undigested fatty acids chelate calcium, which would normally bind oxalate and lead to its excretion in the feces. Patients with Crohn disease often have pathologically increased luminal oxalate and increased oxalate absorption. After entering the serum, oxalate is excreted in the urine (hyperoxaluria), where it binds calcium and forms calcium oxalate stones.\nEpisodes of increased urination followed by oliguria are caused by temporary ureteral obstruction by stones. If a ureter is blocked, urine cannot pass through. When the obstruction is relieved, copious urine flows into the bladder.","bool":true},{"option":"High urine pH","explanation":"High urine pH is a risk factor for the precipitation of calcium phosphate stones, which appear as wedge-shaped prisms on urinalysis. An alkaline environment increases the concentration of dibasic phosphate (HPO42-) in the urine, which is prone to bind to dicationic calcium (Ca2+) to form calcium phosphate stones. A high urine pH is also a risk factor for the formation of struvite stones, which appear as rectangular prisms (coffin-lids) on urinalysis. In contrast, a low urine pH is a risk factor for the precipitation of oxalate stones.","bool":false},{"option":"Defective tubular amino acid reabsorption","explanation":"Defective tubular amino acid reabsorption is the underlying cause of cystinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder that increases the risk of cystine stones. This patient's father had recurrent kidney stones.

Muscarinic M3 receptor stimulation is responsible for bladder contraction; thus, inhibition leads to improvement of symptoms in patients with urge incontinence. Pharmacotherapy should be reserved as an additional therapeutic option for patients in which behavioral therapy and lifestyle modifications alone were insufficient. Because muscarinic M3 receptors are located in various glands and in smooth muscles, anticholinergic agents have several systemic side effects, including pupillary dilation, dry mouth, constipation, tachycardia, and impaired cognition. They should be used with caution in patients predisposed to delirium (e.g., elderly patients).

Recurrent renal colic in a patient with calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis is strongly suggestive of an underlying hypercalciuria.","answers":[{"option":"Chlorthalidone","explanation":"\nThiazide diuretics, such as chlorthalidone, increase calcium reabsorption in the renal tubules and decrease hypercalciuria. In patients with recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis and, what is likely, hypercalciuria, a thiazide diuretic is indicated to decrease urinary calcium levels and minimize the risk of recurrent calcium stone formation.\nAdditional measures to prevent the formation of calcium phosphate stones include a low sodium diet, which enhances the effect thiazides have in promoting calcium reabsorption from the renal tubule, and urine acidification as calcium phosphate stones predominantly form in alkaline urine.","bool":true},{"option":"Allopurinol","explanation":"\nAllopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, decreases urinary uric acid levels and is indicated to prevent recurrent stone formation in patients with uric acid nephrolithiasis or in those with calcium nephrolithiasis and a high urinary uric acid level. Uric acid stones appear as rhomboid or needle-shaped crystals. Since this patient's urinalysis shows wedge-shaped prisms and normal serum uric acid levels, allopurinol would not be beneficial.","bool":false},{"option":"High-protein diet","explanation":"A high-protein diet increases urinary calcium excretion and is a risk factor for calcium nephrolithiasis, which this patient most likely has, as evident from the wedge-shaped prisms seen on urinalysis. The metabolism of animal protein generates amino-acids that decrease the plasma pH. To buffer this acidity, calcium is released from bone to increase plasma pH (bone buffering). This, in turn, increases renal calcium excretion. Thus, a low- rather than a high-protein diet would be recommended in this patient to minimize the risk of recurrent calcium stone formation.","bool":false},{"option":"Low-potassium diet","explanation":"A low-potassium diet has been associated with an increased risk of calcium nephrolithiasis, which this patient most likely has, as evident from the wedge-shaped prisms on urinalysis. Potassium increases urinary citrate excretion. Citrate binds to urinary calcium and forms soluble complexes that are then excreted.

Decreased dietary calcium intake stimulates intestinal oxalate absorption, which, in turn, increases renal oxalate excretion (hyperoxaluria). Oxalate binds to calcium, forming calcium oxalate stones, which would be seen as bipyramidal crystals (envelope appearance) crystals on urinalysis. Although this patient does not have oxalate stones on urinalysis, decreasing calcium intake would increase her risk of developing oxalate stones.

Women have a higher risk of contracting UTIs because they have a shorter urethra, which allows bacteria that colonize the vulva and perineum to ascend into the bladder. Moreover, this woman has several risk factors for UTIs, such as multiple sexual partners and the use of a diaphragm, which alters the vaginal flora and makes users more prone to the introduction of uropathogens to the lower urinary tract. Untreated lower UTIs can ascend the ureters to the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis.\nSymptoms of lower urinary tract infection in a nonpregnant woman without a history of periurethral intervention or evidence of anatomical or functional abnormalities suggest uncomplicated cystitis. This patient should be treated with nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for 3 days, or a single dose of fosfomycin.","bool":true},{"option":"Radiation-induced inflammation","explanation":"Radiation-induced inflammation of the mucosa of the bladder is the underlying mechanism of radiation cystitis. This condition is a potential complication of radiotherapy, which was used to treat cervical cancer in this patient.

However, pyuria and positive nitrites indicate that the patient's symptoms are due to infection rather than radiation-induced tissue damage.","bool":false},{"option":"Neural hypersensitivity","explanation":"Neural hypersensitivity is one of the suspected mechanisms leading to interstitial cystitis. Interstitial cystitis can manifest with dysuria and pelvic pain. If Hunner's ulcers develop, interstitial cystitis may also manifest with microscopic hematuria, as seen here. However, interstitial cystitis is a noninfectious disorder that would not cause pyuria or a positive nitrite test. Moreover, by definition, interstitial cystitis is characterized by symptoms lasting ≥ 6 weeks.","bool":false},{"option":"Malignant transformation","explanation":"Malignant transformation of urothelial cells is the most common underlying mechanism of bladder cancer. Although it is exceedingly rare in patients this young, bladder cancer is possible in this woman given the presence of risk factors such as smoking, pelvic irradiation, and cyclophosphamide treatment. However, the most common symptom in patients with bladder carcinoma is painless gross hematuria; pelvic pain and dysuria (which are seen in this patient) would be very late manifestations of bladder cancer. In this case, pyuria and a positive nitrite test suggest an infectious etiology.","bool":false},{"option":"Hematogenous spread of infection","explanation":"While hematogenous spread does not play a role in the pathogenesis of uropathogenic cystitis, pyelonephritis may be caused by this mechanism, especially in neonates and IV drug users. However, in addition to abdominal pain, dysuria, pyuria, and microhematuria, pyelonephritis would manifest with high fever/chills, costovertebral angle tenderness, and WBC casts on urinalysis, none of which are present in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Adverse effect of medication","explanation":"\nCyclophosphamide, which was used to treat a flare of systemic lupus erythematosus in this patient, can cause acute hemorrhagic cystitis (as well as nonhemorrhagic cystitis). Although patients with hemorrhagic cystitis can present with hematuria and dysuria, the presence of pyuria and a positive nitrite test in this patient's urinalysis indicate that her symptoms are due to infection. Furthermore, chemotherapy-induced cystitis typically occurs within hours to days of infusion.","bool":false},{"option":"Sexually transmitted infection","explanation":"Lower abdominal pain and dysuria can be symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which most often occurs due to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) with Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Pyuria, as seen in this case, may result from any inflammatory process within the pelvis, including PID. Moreover, the fact that this patient has multiple sexual partners and does not use barrier protection puts her at increased risk of contracting an STI.

Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a soft and gravid abdomen with normal bowel sounds. There is guarding on the left lateral side and tenderness to palpation over the left costovertebral angle. Urinalysis shows hematuria but no proteinuria or pyuria. Ultrasonography of the kidneys shows a 4 mm stone in the left proximal ureter with mild hydronephrosis. The patient successfully passes the stone the next day and it is found to be composed of calcium and oxalate. At a follow-up evaluation one week later, the patient inquires about measures to prevent recurrence of kidney stones. In addition to adequate hydration, which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation?","difficulty":4,"hint":"The preventative measure targets the amount of calcium that is excreted in the urine.","answers":[{"option":"Decrease animal protein intake","explanation":"The consumption of animal protein is associated with increased urinary calcium, which can precipitate calcium stones; both calcium oxalate (most common) and calcium phosphate types. Therefore, this patient should be advised to reduce their intake of animal protein. Other conservative measures for calcium stones include generous hydration (the most important intervention; fluid intake should be ≥ 2.5 L/day), a low-sodium diet (prevents dehydration), and reduced consumption of oxalate-rich foods. In patients with recurrent calcium-containing stones with idiopathic hypercalciuria, thiazide diuretics (increase tubular reabsorption of Ca2+, which decreases urinary Ca2+) and urine alkalinization (e.g., with potassium citrate) can be considered.","bool":true},{"option":"Adopt high-oxalate diet","explanation":"A high-oxalate diet is a risk factor for the development of kidney stones. Increased oxalate consumption leads to hyperoxaluria, which in turn can bind to calcium in the renal tubule and precipitate into calcium oxalate stones, the most common type of kidney stones (80%). Therefore, a low-oxalate diet would be recommended for this patient to decrease her risk of nephrolithiasis.","bool":false},{"option":"Restrict intake of calcium ","explanation":"In the intestinal lumen, calcium binds to oxalate, which is then excreted in the feces. A low-calcium diet decreases intestinal excretion of oxalate, freeing up more for absorption. As a result, the increased urinary oxalate binds more calcium in the renal tubule, which can precipitate calcium oxalate stones, the most common type of kidney stones. Therefore, this patient would not benefit from a low-calcium diet.","bool":false},{"option":"Begin thiazide therapy","explanation":"\nThiazide diuretics can be used for prophylaxis of recurrent calcium-containing stones in the general population. Thiazides are primarily indicated for patients with hypercalciuria, as they increase calcium reabsorption from the renal tubule, which decreases the amount of tubular calcium available for precipitation and stone formation. Diuretics are generally avoided in pregnancy because of the increased risk of dehydration and volume depletion. Additionally, thiazide diuretics in particular can cause fetal side effects such as thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia. Furthermore, thiazide diuretics should only be considered to prevent stone recurrence after conducting a metabolic evaluation, which is not routinely performed in first-time stone formers.","bool":false},{"option":"Start vitamin C supplementation","explanation":"\nVitamin C supplementation is unlikely to benefit this patient. Excess vitamin C is excreted in the urine in the form of oxalate, which precipitates with calcium in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.","bool":false}]},{"id":205,"info":"Renal and Urinary System","question":"A 77-year-old man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation is admitted to the hospital because of a 3-hour history of nausea and flank pain.

Microscopic examination of the pale region in the photograph shows preserved cellular architecture with eosinophilic cytoplasm and no visible nuclei. Which of the following pathological changes is most likely responsible for the splenic findings on autopsy?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The photograph shows several pale, wedge-shaped splenic infarcts, which can manifest with flank pain and nausea. The most likely cause of the infarct in this patient was an embolus due to atrial fibrillation.","answers":[{"option":"Coagulative necrosis","explanation":"\nCoagulative necrosis occurs as a result of tissue ischemia in solid organs such as the heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys (e.g., splenic infarction). Ischemia is characterized by decreased oxygen delivery, which reduces the amount of ATP produced via aerobic glycolysis. The hypoxic cells have to switch to anaerobic metabolism, which increases the production of lactic acid, resulting in acidosis. Acidosis causes denaturation of proteins (including proteolytic and particularly lysosomal enzymes), and this prevents the cell from dissolving (autolysis). For this reason, coagulative necrosis is characterized by a temporary preserved cellular architecture either without cell nuclei or with nuclei that are still undergoing karyolysis. See “Types of necrosis” table.\nAn infarction can be differentiated into two types: red infarct and pale infarct. A red infarct typically occurs due to venous occlusion in tissues with multiple blood supplies (e.g., intestine, liver, lung), and a pale infarct typically occurs in solid organs with a single (end-arterial) blood supply (e.g., kidney, spleen, heart).","bool":true},{"option":"Fibrinoid necrosis","explanation":"\nFibrinoid necrosis is most commonly seen in blood vessels in patients with vasculitides or malignant hypertension. It is characterized by immune complex and/or fibrin deposition in the blood vessel wall. This patient’s ischemic infarct was in the spleen, which is not subject to fibrinoid necrosis. Histologic examination of fibrinoid necrosis would show protein-rich, eosinophilic acellular material in damaged vessels.","bool":false},{"option":"Nonenzymatic fat necrosis","explanation":"\nNonenzymatic fat necrosis is most commonly seen in fatty tissue (e.g., breast, subcutaneous tissue) following blunt trauma or surgery. This patient’s ischemic infarct was in the spleen, in which nonenzymatic fat necrosis could not occur. Histologic examination of nonenzymatic fat necrosis would show lipid-laden macrophages with foreign body giant cells as well as fibrosis and dystrophic calcifications.","bool":false},{"option":"Caseous necrosis","explanation":"\nCaseous necrosis is associated with granulomatous infections such as nocardiosis, tuberculosis (including renal tuberculosis), and histoplasmosis. This patient’s ischemic infarct was in the spleen, which does not result in caseous necrosis. Granulomas typically appear as focal, round, or lobulated nodules with surrounding edema. Histologic examination of caseous necrosis would show acellular material that appears granular and is surrounded by macrophages, T-cells and giant cells.","bool":false},{"option":"Liquefactive necrosis","explanation":"In liquefactive necrosis, lysosomal enzymes are released in order to degrade and liquefy necrotic material. Liquefactive necrosis is classically seen in cerebral infarctions and can also occur in bacterial abscesses (pyogenic renal abscesses), but this patient’s ischemic infarct was in the spleen, which is not subject to liquefactive necrosis. Histologic examination of the tissue affected by liquefactive necrosis would show liquified tissue (due to the release of hydrolytic and lysosomal enzymes) with multiple macrophages and cyst formation.","bool":false},{"option":"Gangrenous necrosis","explanation":"\nGangrenous necrosis is most commonly seen in patients with chronic limb ischemia (dry gangrene) or gastrointestinal tract ischemia (wet gangrene). A histologic examination of dry gangrene, which results from tissue ischemia, would show preservation of cellular architecture along with the absence of nuclei as seen in this patient.

The pharmaceutical treatment of choice for altitude sickness is acetazolamide, a urine alkalinizing agent.","answers":[{"option":"Proximal convoluted tubule","explanation":"\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors like acetazolamide enhance bicarbonate elimination in the proximal convoluted tubule. Bicarbonate diuresis results in urine alkalinization as well as normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. The latter drives compensatory respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation) and thus speeds the acclimatization process of altitude sickness by increasing the blood oxygen concentration and reducing carbon dioxide levels.","bool":true},{"option":"Ascending loop of Henle","explanation":"\nLoop diuretics block the Na+/K+/2Cl- transporter in the ascending loop of Henle, which impairs the nephron's ability to reabsorb electrolytes and leads to diuresis. Loop diuretics decrease the urinary pH by increasing K+ and H+ secretion in the kidney; they are not used to treat altitude sickness.","bool":false},{"option":"Early distal convoluted tubule","explanation":"\nThiazide diuretics block the Na+/Cl- transporter in the early distal convoluted tubule, resulting in natriuresis and diuresis. Increased sodium excretion also increases potassium and hydrogen excretion, which acidifies the urine rather than alkalinizing it.

Which of the following is most likely to prevent future episodes of flank pain?","difficulty":1,"hint":"The radiopaque mass in the area of the ureter and biconcave dumbbells on urinalysis confirm the diagnosis of calcium oxalate stones.","answers":[{"option":"Maintain adequate hydration","explanation":"Inadequate hydration causes supersaturation of solutes in urine, which increases the risk of stone formation. Fluid intake of ≥ 2.5 L/day reduces the risk of recurrent nephrolithiasis because it decreases the urinary solute concentration and increases the frequency of urination. Adequate hydration prevents recurrence of all types of urinary stones. This patient should also be advised against excessive consumption of energy drinks, which often contain oxalate and contribute to the formation of calcium oxalate stones.\nCalcium oxalate stones can also appear as bipyramidal envelopes on urinalysis.","bool":true},{"option":"Decrease caffeine consumption","explanation":"Although the association between caffeinated beverages and formation of renal stones is not entirely clear, increased (not decreased) caffeine consumption (either coffee or tea) decreases the recurrence rate of nephrolithiasis, most likely by improving urinary flow and decreasing urinary supersaturation. Coffee and tea also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that potentially reduce the risk of stone formation.","bool":false},{"option":"Begin loop diuretic","explanation":"\nLoop diuretics inhibit reabsorption of calcium in the loop of Henle, causing hypercalciuria, which promotes calcium stone formation. Thiazide diuretics, however, increase calcium reabsorption in the renal tubules and decrease urinary calcium levels, which prevents the formation of calcium stones.","bool":false},{"option":"Restrict dietary calcium intake","explanation":"Restricting normal dietary calcium intake (approx. 1000 mg/day) enhances the intestinal absorption of oxalate. This increases urinary oxalate excretion and the risk of recurrent calcium oxalate stones. In addition, prolonged low dietary calcium can decrease bone mineral density and cause osteoporosis. However, supplemental calcium intake (above the normal daily requirements) should be restricted in patients with calcium stones.","bool":false},{"option":"Start high-dose vitamin C","explanation":"\nVitamin C is metabolized to oxalate, which is then excreted in urine.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?\n","difficulty":5,"hint":"This patient has postoperative oliguria, lower abdominal pain, and a palpable pelvic mass that is dull on percussion, suggesting bladder distention. In combination, these findings indicate acute urinary retention (AUR). What is the most common cause of bladder outflow obstruction in older men?","answers":[{"option":"Benign prostatic enlargement","explanation":"\nBenign prostatic enlargement (BPE) is the most common cause of bladder outflow obstruction and AUR in older men. An acute inability to micturate can be the initial presentation of BPE. This patient probably had an underlying asymptomatic prostatic enlargement, and the perioperative catheterization then likely resulted in edema of the prostatic urethra, which explains the failed attempt at transurethral recatheterization. This urethral edema caused a blockade of the urinary outflow from the bladder, which induced AUR.\nSince transurethral catheterization was not successful, a suprapubic catheter should be placed for immediate relief of the distended bladder. Following this, the patient should undergo a trial of voiding without a catheter. Furthermore, the outflow obstruction should be evaluated with a uroflowmetry test to quantify the obstruction, and the suitability for treatment options, e.g., with alpha-1 blockers, should be discussed.","bool":true},{"option":"Urethral stricture","explanation":"\nUrethral stricture is a possible cause of AUR. Iatrogenic manipulation (e.g., injury related to transurethral insertion of an oversized endoscope or catheter placement) is the most common etiology of urethral stricture. While this patient was catheterized transurethrally during surgery, it takes much longer than several hours for scar tissue of a urethral stricture to form. Recurrent urethritis may also cause urethral stricture. Because this patient has no history of previous surgeries requiring catheterization or recurrent urethral infections, urethral stricture is an unlikely diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Adverse effect of pilocarpine","explanation":"A number of drugs that act on the autonomic system can cause AUR by either decreasing detrusor activity (parasympatholytic agents) or increasing urethral sphincter tone (sympathomimetic agents). Pilocarpine is, however, a direct parasympathomimetic agent that would increase detrusor activity, which facilitates bladder emptying. This patient also takes pilocarpine intraocularly, which makes it highly unlikely that the systemic concentration of the drug would be high enough to have any effect on the bladder.","bool":false},{"option":"Acute prostatitis","explanation":"Acute prostatitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection of the urinary tract and may also manifest with AUR. While this patient's sexual behavior and the history of indwelling catheterization put him at higher risk for urinary tract infections, acute bacterial prostatitis usually manifests with spiking fevers, chills, and perineal pain. The absence of fever and a normal leukocyte count make acute prostatitis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Neurogenic bladder","explanation":"\nNeurogenic bladder may manifest with AUR and is a common cause of bladder outflow obstruction, especially in young men and women. It results from injury to the central nervous system (e.g., multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, stroke) or the peripheral nerves that supply the bladder (e.g., diabetic neuropathy). Postoperative neurogenic bladder, however, is usually only seen following spinal anesthesia and abdominopelvic surgeries, either of which can cause neural damage resulting in impaired autonomic bladder control; neurogenic bladder is highly unlikely to occur as a sequela of total knee replacement.

In patients with hemodynamically significant RAS complicated by heart failure, hypertensive emergencies, resistance to medical treatment, or an unexplained unilateral small kidney (as seen here), revascularization is indicated in addition to medical therapy. The short duration of hypertension in this patient is a further indication that interventional revascularization is likely to normalize blood pressures. In patients with fibromuscular dysplasia who have severe unilateral disease, as in this case, PTA without stent placement is the first-line revascularization procedure. In the absence of complications (e.g., arterial dissection, renal artery perforation), stent placement is usually avoided.\nIn patients with bilateral stenosis or stenosis of a single functioning kidney, revascularization is indicated if there is progressive renal insufficiency or hemodynamically significant RAS.

The young boy described here has normal gestation and birth histories.","bool":false},{"option":"Family history of diabetes mellitus","explanation":"\nDiabetes mellitus may predispose individuals to UTI because of several factors. First, an abundance of glucose in the urine acts as a nutrient source and encourages bacterial overgrowth. Moreover, patients with diabetes mellitus experience varying degrees of immune dysfunction, further predisposing them to infection.

Her temperature is 36.2°C (97.2°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 118/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is distended and tender to deep palpation. Examination shows a uterus that extends to the umbilicus; there is copious, thick, blood-red vaginal discharge. Neurologic examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's urinary incontinence?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient's involuntary loss of urine, abdominal distention, and tenderness after the administration of epidural analgesia for peripartal pain management suggest overflow incontinence. Blood-red vaginal discharge (lochia rubra) is a normal finding during the first 4 days after birth.","answers":[{"option":"Overdistended bladder","explanation":"\nOverdistention of the bladder can cause postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and overflow incontinence. Spinal anesthesia reduces bladder and internal sphincter contractility as well as the micturition reflex, leading to overfilling of the bladder. Additionally, perineal trauma or stretching during delivery can injure the pudendal nerve, resulting in increased distal motor latency and, consequently, delayed voluntary control of the external urethral sphincter. Intermittent catheterization is performed both to prevent overdistention of the bladder intrapartum and to treat PUR and overflow incontinence postpartum. Most cases of PUR resolve spontaneously.\nIn addition to spinal anesthesia, risk factors for PUR include operative vaginal delivery, episiotomy, and primiparity.","bool":true},{"option":"Intrinsic sphincter deficiency","explanation":"Intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) is most commonly caused by neuromuscular damage to the pelvic floor, which is associated with factors such as macrosomia, forceps delivery, and rapid delivery of the fetal head in breech presentation. ISD usually affects women who have had multiple pelvic surgeries or vaginal deliveries, and it manifests with stress incontinence. This patient is primiparous and shows no signs of stress incontinence (e.g., positive bladder stress test).","bool":false},{"option":"Vesicovaginal fistula","explanation":"A vesicovaginal fistula can develop due to tissue trauma in complications of labor. Extended periods of tissue compression during prolonged labor restrict blood flow, and instruments used for operative vaginal delivery can cause lacerations, damaging the tissue between the vagina and bladder. When the tissue becomes necrotic, a fistula forms, manifesting with total incontinence. This patient's prolonged labor puts her at increased risk of developing a vesicovaginal fistula, but she shows no symptoms of this condition (e.g., continual leakage of urine from the vagina). Obstetric fistulas are uncommon in industrialized countries.","bool":false},{"option":"Spinal epidural hematoma","explanation":"A spinal epidural hematoma can develop as a complication of epidural anesthesia, which in turn can cause reflex incontinence by compressing the spinal cord. However, this patient has neither symptoms of reflex incontinence nor any associated neurological deficits (e.g., radicular back pain, paresis of the legs).","bool":false},{"option":"Urinary tract infection","explanation":"\nUrinary incontinence may occur as a manifestation of a urinary tract infection (UTI) secondary to irritation and sudden contraction of the bladder wall. While the likelihood of experiencing urinary incontinence increases with recurrent UTIs, this patient has no symptoms suggestive of a current UTI (e.g., urinary urgency, dysuria), and chronic urge incontinence is unlikely to develop after only two UTIs.","bool":false},{"option":"Pelvic organ prolapse","explanation":"\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) can occur as a complication of vaginal delivery and may cause overflow incontinence. However, POP is characterized by a feeling of vaginal fullness or pressure around the perineum. Moreover, POP more commonly affects women who have had multiple vaginal deliveries or traumatic births, and it manifests with urge or stress incontinence in the early stages. Overflow incontinence due to bladder outlet obstruction is usually only seen in advanced stages, which is unlikely in a patient without visible prolapse on pelvic examination.","bool":false}]},{"id":220,"info":"Renal and Urinary System","question":"\nA 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intense retrosternal chest pain for the last 3 days. The pain is worse with breathing or coughing, and improves while sitting upright. She also reports a mild fever and shortness of breath.

Uremic pericarditis is less likely to manifest with the classic diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions seen on ECG in other types of pericarditis, possibly because uremic pericarditis has a metabolic etiology and epicardial injury is uncommon. Uremic pericarditis is an indication for urgent hemodialysis.\n","bool":true},{"option":"Serositis from an immunologic reaction","explanation":"\nSerositis of the pericardium is one of the most common cardiac manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and should always be considered in a patient with SLE presenting with chest pain. However, unlike in this patient, SLE pericarditis usually manifests with ECG changes (i.e., diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions in all leads except aVR) due to involvement of the epicardium. Additionally, this patient's normal anti-DNA antibodies do not suggest an active SLE flare and thus, it would be unlikely to explain her current presentation.","bool":false},{"option":"Purulent exudate in the pericardial space","explanation":"\nPurulent pericarditis refers to localized infection of the pericardial space (usually bacterial or fungal) and is characterized by purulent exudate.

A more delayed and serious response, Dressler syndrome (postmyocardial infarction syndrome), can occur between 1 week to 3 months after MI, and is thought to be secondary to immune complex formation within the pericardium. In both cases, patients may present with low-grade fever and chest pain, and often ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes are present. This patient's history of MI is too remote and she has no evidence for current cardiac ischemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Low serum levels of thyroid hormone","explanation":"Although rare, severe hypothyroidism can cause acute pericarditis. This patient lacks any symptoms of hypothyroidism (e.g., fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, myxedema), making this diagnosis unlikely.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Adverse effect of medication","explanation":"Certain medications can cause pericarditis, including methotrexate (also used to treat SLE), doxorubicin, hydralazine, or isoniazid.

These findings are characteristic of nodular glomerulosclerosis.","answers":[{"option":"Chronic hyperglycemia","explanation":"This patient's signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome and chronic kidney disease in combination with nodular glomerulosclerosis on biopsy are consistent with advanced diabetic nephropathy. In patients with insufficiently controlled diabetes mellitus, chronic hyperglycemia results in non-enzymatic glycosylation of tissue proteins. This leads to an expansion of the mesangium and subsequent formation of characteristic Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules in the glomerular tuft. In addition, hyperfiltration (due to increased blood pressure in the glomerulus and increased glomerular filtration rate) causes glomerular hypertrophy and scarring (i.e., glomerulosclerosis).\nFirst-line antihypertensive treatment in patients with diabetic nephropathy consists of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers. Both have been shown to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy and decrease protein excretion.","bool":true},{"option":"Amyloidosis","explanation":"\nRenal amyloidosis can cause nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency. Amyloid deposits resemble the pink hyaline material seen in this photomicrograph, but amyloidosis does not cause nodular glomerulosclerosis with Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules.

Chronic hypertension leads to intimal thickening and hyaline deposition into the glomerular arteriolar walls, resulting in progressive vascular narrowing (arteriolosclerosis), subsequent glomerular and tubular ischemia, and ultimately tubular atrophy and glomerulosclerosis. However, hypertensive nephrosclerosis causes global or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, not nodular glomerulosclerosis with Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules.","bool":false},{"option":"HIV infection","explanation":"\nHIV infection is associated with the development of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a common cause of nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency. Typical findings of FSGS include glomerulosclerosis and hyalinosis, which is found in this patient's renal biopsy. However, FSGS is characterized by segmental areas of sclerosis in some glomeruli, but not all. Moreover, Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules are not seen in FSGS.","bool":false},{"option":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","explanation":"Renal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus include diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN) and membranous nephropathy, both of which can manifest with nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency, as seen in this patient.

Instead, a photomicrograph of lupus nephritis typically shows “wire looping” of capillaries in DPGN and diffuse capillary and glomerular basement membrane thickening in membranous nephropathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Recurrent kidney infections","explanation":"Recurrent kidney infections may result in chronic pyelonephritis and eventually, chronic kidney disease, which this patient shows signs and symptoms of. However, he reports no prior episodes of flank pain or dysuria suggestive of pyelonephritis. Renal biopsy typically shows fibrosis of the renal interstitium, asymmetric scarring of the renal cortex and medulla, and acellular, eosinophilic casts (Tamm-Horsfall protein) within the renal tubules (tubular thyroidization).

Prerenal AKI due to hypovolemia causes renal hypoperfusion rather than direct damage to the nephrons. The kidneys physiologically respond to hypoperfusion by reabsorbing large amounts of sodium, which is then followed by water. As a result, the excreted urine contains low amounts of sodium and is concentrated.\nIn intrinsic AKI (caused by direct kidney damage), the function of the tubular system is impaired, leading to reduced reabsorption of sodium and a urine sodium concentration &gt; 40 mmol/L.","bool":true},{"option":"Proteinuria","explanation":"\nProteinuria results from direct kidney injury secondary to damage to the glomeruli (e.g., glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy), damage to the tubules (e.g., Fanconi syndrome), or overproduction of low molecular weight proteins (e.g., multiple myeloma). Patients with intrinsic AKI may also present with oliguria and azotemia, as seen here.

Also, the BUN:creatinine ratio would not be increased.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased urine osmolarity","explanation":"Intrinsic causes of AKI typically manifest with a decreased urine osmolality (&lt; 350 mOsm/kg), as the kidney loses the ability to concentrate the urine. Acute tubular necrosis (e.g., due to hypoxia) is the most common cause of AKI in the postoperative period. However, the BUN:creatinine ratio is decreased (≤ 15:1) in patients with intrinsic AKI because the renal damage causes decreased urea reabsorption.

Symptoms such as fatigue, muscle cramps, polyuria, and chondrocalcinosis typically arise in late childhood and can be attributed to the associated electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and hypocalciuria). In addition, Gitelman syndrome causes metabolic alkalosis due to mild RAAS activation that occurs in response to natriuresis and volume depletion. Treatment for Gitelman syndrome consists of potassium supplementation and a potassium-sparing diuretic (e.g., spironolactone, amiloride).\nBecause thiazide diuretics target the Na+-Cl- cotransporters in the distal convoluted tubule, patients with Gitelman syndrome have a blunted response to these agents, with the response being measured as the fractional clearance of chloride.

Between these episodes, patients typically have asymptomatic urinary abnormalities, such as microhematuria. The most likely etiology of these findings is an increased number of defective circulating IgA antibodies, the synthesis of which is triggered by mucosal infections (e.g., pharyngitis). These IgA antibodies form immune complexes that deposit in the mesangium of the renal glomerulus, leading to glomerulonephritis (type III hypersensitivity reaction). A renal biopsy provides a definitive diagnosis but is usually only indicated if there are signs of severe or progressive disease (e.g., proteinuria &gt; 0.5–1 g/24 h, hypertension, elevated creatinine levels).","bool":true},{"option":"Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis","explanation":"\nPoststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) can manifest with hypertension and gross hematuria following upper respiratory tract infection. PSGN is more common in children, however, and usually manifests 10–30 days after an acute infection. Furthermore, C3 complement levels are low in PSGN, whereas this patient's C3 complement levels are normal.","bool":false},{"option":"Minimal change disease","explanation":"\nMinimal change disease (MCD) often occurs following a viral infection. However, MCD manifests with nephrotic-range proteinuria and edema, which is not seen here. Finally, MCD most commonly affects children &lt; 6 years of age.","bool":false},{"option":"Goodpasture syndrome","explanation":"\nAntiglomerular basement membrane disease (Goodpasture syndrome) most commonly affects young adult male individuals and can manifest with nephritic-range proteinuria and hematuria. However, Goodpasture syndrome also affects the pulmonary capillary basement membrane (in most cases; due to autoantibodies against collagen type IV), leading to hemoptysis, cough, and dyspnea, none of which is seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis","explanation":"\nDiffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN) can manifest with gross hematuria, elevated serum creatinine, and nephritic sediment. However, DPGN most commonly develops in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); this man has no features of SLE (e.g., rash, photosensitivity, or joint pain). Moreover, DPGN typically manifests with low serum C3 complement levels.","bool":false},{"option":"Alport syndrome","explanation":"\nAlport syndrome most commonly affects male individuals and manifests with intermittent episodes of gross hematuria. As the disease progresses, findings may include nephritic sediment on urinalysis and a decrease in kidney function (increased serum creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations). However, in individuals affected by Alport syndrome, hematuria is almost always detected during infancy or childhood. In addition, a personal or family history of sensorineural hearing loss and/or ocular findings (e.g., lenticonus) is characteristic of Alport syndrome, which this patient does not have.","bool":false}]},{"id":238,"info":"Renal and Urinary System","question":"A 72-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He says that he has felt well except for occasional headaches. He has no history of major medical illness. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 155/90 mm Hg. An ultrasound of the kidneys shows a normal right kidney and a left kidney that is 2 cm smaller in length. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?","difficulty":2,"hint":"An atrophic kidney in a patient with new-onset hypertension should raise concern for renal artery stenosis, a narrowing of one or both renal arteries that decreases renal perfusion, which then activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and causes secondary hypertension.","answers":[{"option":"Abdominal bruit","explanation":"An abnormal swishing sound heard on auscultation over a blood vessel is referred to as bruit. It reflects the turbulence of the blood flow in a stenosed vascular segment. The abdominal bruit of renal artery stenosis is continuous (occurs during systole and diastole) and can be auscultated over the costovertebral angles of the flank and/or over the epigastrium, 2–3 cm lateral to the midline.","bool":true},{"option":"Varicocele","explanation":"\nVaricoceles are classically caused by compression of the venous system that drains the testicle (e.g., due to renal cell carcinoma). RCC can cause new-onset hypertension (due to production of renin) but appears as a mass on imaging rather than renal atrophy.","bool":false},{"option":"Hematuria","explanation":"\nHematuria and new-onset hypertension can develop in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or nephritic syndrome. However, neither of these conditions causes renal atrophy.

However, RCC usually appears as a mass on imaging rather than renal atrophy.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated urine metanephrines","explanation":"Elevated urinary metanephrines are diagnostic of pheochromocytoma, which can cause new-onset hypertension and headaches. However, pheochromocytoma appears as a solid or cystic lesion in the adrenal glands on imaging rather than renal atrophy.","bool":false}]},{"id":239,"info":"Renal and Urinary System","question":"A 60-year-old multiparous woman comes to the physician because of urinary leakage for the past 4 months. She involuntarily loses a small amount of urine after experiencing a sudden, painful sensation in the bladder. She wakes up at night several times to urinate, and she sometimes cannot make it to the bathroom in time. She has diabetes mellitus type 2 controlled with insulin and a history of pelvic organ prolapse, for which she underwent surgical treatment 5 years ago. Menopause was 11 years ago. She drinks 4-5 cups of coffee daily. Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities, and a Q-tip test is negative. Ultrasound of the bladder shows a normal postvoid residual urine. Which of the following is the underlying cause of this patient's urinary incontinence?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient most likely has urge incontinence, as evidenced by her sudden urge to urinate resulting in frequent small volume voids. This condition can also cause nocturia, and be exacerbated by bladder irritants (e.g., caffeine).","answers":[{"option":"Increased detrusor muscle activity","explanation":"\nUrge incontinence can result from increased detrusor muscle activity, which causes involuntary detrusor muscle contraction and urinary tenesmus that lead to a sudden release of urine. Antimuscarinic agents (e.g., oxybutynin) can help treat this condition by decreasing detrusor muscle tone.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased urine bladder volumes","explanation":"\nAutonomic diabetic neuropathy can lead to an underactive detrusor that does not effectively contract enough to empty, resulting in overflow incontinence. Despite this patient's history of diabetes mellitus, overflow incontinence usually causes continuous urinary leakage or dribbling (not sudden episodes of urinary loss), and postvoid residual urine volumes would be increased.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased estrogen levels","explanation":"Decreased estrogen levels in postmenopausal women can result in atrophy of the urethral mucosal layers (e.g., decreased urethral mucosal seal, decreased urethral compliance, increased urethral irritation), all of which can contribute to incontinence. Although this patient's postmenopausal estrogen levels may be a contributing factor for her incontinence, her sudden urge to void with loss of urine suggests that urge incontinence is the primary etiology.","bool":false},{"option":"Recurrent pelvic organ prolapse","explanation":"Early stage pelvic organ prolapse and stress incontinence often co-occur, as both can result from vaginal wall weakening. Since the patient underwent surgery for pelvic organ prolapse in the past, a recurrent pelvic organ prolapse is possible, but prolapse does not cause urinary incontinence in itself. In fact, advanced stages of pelvic organ prolapse may be associated with improvements in incontinence due to kinking of the urethra. Importantly, pelvic organ prolapse is not associated with urge incontinence.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased pelvic floor muscle tone","explanation":"\nStress incontinence can result from decreased pelvic floor muscle tone in which the urethra and bladder neck cannot completely close against the anterior vaginal wall. As a result, increases in intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing, lifting) force urine through an incompletely closed urethra. Although this patient was likely suffering from decreased pelvic floor muscle tone before she underwent surgical treatment for symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse, she currently has no evidence of stress incontinence (her Q-tip test is negative, has leakage of urine unrelated to coughing).","bool":false},{"option":"Excessive caffeine consumption","explanation":"Excessive caffeine consumption can exacerbate the symptoms of urinary incontinence by increasing the volume of daily urine (due to the caffeine's diuretic effect) and irritating the bladder lining. Therefore, this patient should be advised to limit her caffeine consumption. However, caffeine consumption in itself does not cause urinary incontinence.","bool":false}]},{"id":240,"info":"Renal and Urinary System","question":"\nA 44-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of lower extremity swelling and frothy urine. He has a history of chronic hepatitis C infection. Physical examination shows 3+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?\n","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient with pitting edema and frothy urine (which indicates proteinuria) most likely has nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by structural damage to the glomerular filtration barrier resulting in a loss of protein. Hepatitis C infection is associated with membranous nephropathy, which typically presents with nephrotic syndrome.","answers":[{"option":"Increased lipoproteins","explanation":"\nHypoalbuminemia due to loss of protein in the urine leads to reduced oncotic pressure, which results in a shift of water into the interstitium and subsequent edema formation. Decreased renal blood flow activates the RAAS to increase renal water and salt reabsorption, thereby worsening the edema. To maintain the oncotic pressure, an increase in hepatic lipoprotein synthesis occurs. Increased glomerular permeability results in lipiduria and fatty casts in the urine.\nProteinuria also leads to loss of antithrombin III (resulting in hypercoagulability), antibodies (increased risk of infection), and various transport proteins (risk of vitamin D deficiency, thyroxine deficiency, and altered pharmacodynamics of drugs).","bool":true},{"option":"Increased immunoglobulins","explanation":"An increase in serum immunoglobulin levels is classically seen in viral and bacterial infections. Because immunoglobulins are excreted renally, structural damage to the glomerular filtration barrier (as seen in nephrotic syndrome) would result in a loss of immunoglobulins. Therefore, decreased levels of circulating immunoglobulins with an increased risk of infection would be expected in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Increased antithrombin III","explanation":"Structural damage to the glomerular filtration barrier in nephrotic syndrome results in increased renal excretion of antithrombin III. Therefore, antithrombin III would be decreased rather than increased in this patient. Decreased antithrombin III levels, a deficiency in other anticoagulant proteins (e.g., protein C, protein S), increased production of fibrinogen, as well as hemoconcentration from third-spacing of fluid result in a hypercoagulable state.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased blood urea nitrogen","explanation":"Decreased blood urea nitrogen can be seen in malnutrition due to decreased protein intake; urea is a nitrogenous breakdown product of proteins. In nephrotic syndrome, BUN would most likely be normal (or slightly elevated) due to hemoconcentration secondary to third-spacing of fluid. Elevated BUN levels would indicate progression of renal impairment.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased cystatin C","explanation":"\nCystatin C levels, which are used to assess kidney function, would be normal rather than decreased in nephrotic syndrome. In the event that this patient develops acute kidney injury (e.g., due to hypovolemia from severe third-spacing of fluid), increased cystatin C levels would be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased cholesterol","explanation":"Structural damage to the glomerular filtration barrier in nephrotic syndrome can result in loss of cholesterol and triglycerides in the urine (i.e., lipiduria). However, the loss of protein caused by nephrotic syndrome causes the liver to increase cholesterol production in an attempt to maintain the oncotic pressure. This results in increased rather than decreased serum cholesterol levels.","bool":false}]}]
