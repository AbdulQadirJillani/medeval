Microscopic examination of a smear from the ulcer is most likely to show which of the following?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient's presentation of tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, multiple punched-out ulcers, and systemic signs of infection (e.g., malaise, fever) suggest herpes genitalis, which is typically caused by herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2).","answers":[{"option":"Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions","explanation":"\nEosinophilic intranuclear inclusions on a smear of an ulcer or opened vesicle describe the Cowdry A inclusion bodies seen in infections by herpesviruses such as HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, and CMV. These intranuclear inclusions are formed during herpesvirus replication within the nucleus. Another microscopic characteristic of herpesvirus infection is the formation of multinucleated giant cells as a result of the fusion of multiple infected cells (seen on Tzanck smear). HSV-2 can remain dormant in the sacral ganglia after the primary infection to cause recurrent genital herpes.","bool":true},{"option":"Basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions","explanation":"\nReticulate bodies, which would appear as basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions, are seen with infections by Chlamydia trachomatis. Lymphogranuloma inguinale, which is caused by C. trachomatis serotypes L1–L3, can manifest with multiple genital ulcers, tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms. However, the genital ulcers in lymphogranuloma venereum would be painless. Basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions are not a feature of HSV infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Bipolar-staining intracytoplasmic inclusions","explanation":"Bipolar-staining intracytoplasmic inclusions (Donovan bodies) would be seen in cases of granuloma inguinale, which is caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Granuloma inguinale typically manifests as a single, painless, beefy red ulcer without lymphadenopathy or systemic signs of infection. Bipolar-staining intracytoplasmic inclusions are not a feature of HSV infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Basophilic intranuclear inclusions","explanation":"\nBasophilic intranuclear inclusions can be seen, e.g., in adenovirus infections, which typically manifest with pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, acute hemorrhagic cystitis, gastroenteritis, or myocarditis. Basophilic intranuclear inclusions are not a feature of HSV infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions","explanation":"Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions can be seen in infections by rhabdovirus (e.g., Negri bodies in rabies) or poxvirus (e.g., molluscum contagiosum), both of which are large viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm. Molluscum contagiosum can manifest with genital lesions, but the lesions would be flesh-colored, pearly, dome-shaped, or umbilicated papules, unlike the punched-out ulcers in this patient. Rabies is a terminal CNS disease characterized by insanity and hydrophobia, and Negri bodies would occur only in neurons. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions are not a feature of HSV infection.","bool":false}]},{"id":1,"info":"Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue","question":"A 68-year-old man is brought to the hospital from a skilled nursing care facility because of an ulcer on his back that has increased in size over the past 3 weeks. He has been hemiplegic and bedridden following a spinal cord injury 1 year ago. Since then, he has also had fecal and urinary incontinence. His medical history is remarkable for hypertension controlled with ramipril. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 55 kg (121 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Muscle strength is 0/5 in the lower extremities. Sensation to touch is absent below the umbilicus. Skin examination shows a 5 × 3-cm full-thickness skin ulcer over the sacrum; necrotic tissue and subcutaneous fat are visualized at the base of the ulcer. There is mild erythema surrounding the ulcer. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. The patient is scheduled for surgical treatment with debridement and a fasciocutaneous flap placement. Which of the following is most likely to increase the risk of flap failure in this patient?","difficulty":4,"hint":"Preoperative management (e.g., patient risk-factor optimization, wound bed preparation) plays an important role in the wound closure (e.g., with fasciocutaneous flaps) of pressure-induced injuries such as decubitus ulcers.","answers":[{"option":"Remaining necrotic tissue in the wound bed","explanation":"Remaining necrotic tissue in the wound bed facilitates bacterial growth and thus significantly increases the risk of flap failure. Prior to flap placement, wound bed preparation with debridement, which includes the removal of all necrotic, ischemic, and/or infected tissue, is crucial for preventing or treating infection and enabling healing. Other important measures are wound irrigation with warm, isotonic saline to reduce bacterial contamination and adequate hemostasis after debridement to prevent fluid accumulation under the flap. Moist wound dressing can prevent contamination, absorb exudate, and protect the healing surface.\nFor chronic or complicated wounds for which conservative management is insufficient, there are several treatment options, including tissue flaps and skin grafts. Flaps are composed of numerous types of tissue and are transplanted with their own vascular supply. In contrast to skin grafts, flaps do not depend on adequate vascularization of the recipient site.","bool":true},{"option":"Decreased arterial supply to the wound bed","explanation":"Decreased arterial supply to the wound bed is likely to result in the failure of skin grafts. This patient is scheduled to receive a fasciocutaneous flap, which is transplanted with its own blood supply and therefore does not depend on the vascularization of the recipient site. Flap failure is most commonly the result of vascular compromise of the arterial supply of the flap, not the recipient site. Flap vascularization should be evaluated via Doppler ultrasound prior to tissue transfer.","bool":false},{"option":"Prior monopolar coagulation of the wound bed","explanation":"Monopolar coagulation of the wound bed is used to achieve hemostasis after wound debridement in order to prevent the accumulation of blood and fluid under the tissue flap. Soft tissue flaps are likely to bleed, which may result in significant blood loss and hemostasis thus decreases the risk of flap failure.","bool":false},{"option":"Pressured irrigation with saline solution","explanation":"Pressured irrigation with up to 6 liters of warm, isotonic saline solution is one of the required steps prior to skin flap placement. This procedure reduces the bacteria in the wound bed, thus decreasing the risk of flap failure.","bool":false},{"option":"Pretreatment of the wound bed with negative pressure wound therapy","explanation":"\nNegative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) can be used prior to reconstructive surgery to accelerate wound healing. In NPWT, a negative pressure gradient is generated between the wound bed and a closed system, which increases blood flow to the wound bed, reduces edema, and stimulates the formation of granulation tissue. NPWT also helps ensure a warm and moist wound bed environment, which decreases the risk of bacterial infection and inflammation, thus decreasing the risk of flap failure.","bool":false}]},{"id":2,"info":"Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue","question":"A 16-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of a rash on her face. She says that the rash first appeared after she tried a new makeup product. The rash is not itchy or painful. She reports that it has negatively affected her confidence in public and her academic performance has suffered considerably as a result of stress. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. She is sexually active with multiple male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 75 kg (165 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2.

The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?","difficulty":1,"hint":"The photograph shows papulopustular lesions and closed comedones.","answers":[{"option":"Inflammation of the pilosebaceous unit","explanation":"\nAcne vulgaris, which typically occurs during adolescence, is caused by inflammation of the pilosebaceous unit. Increased sebum production by sebaceous glands due to hormonal stimulation (i.e., increased androgen production in puberty), and accumulating keratin debris due to increased keratinocyte activity leads to blockage of the pilosebaceous duct, resulting in the formation of comedones. As a response to excessive sebum secretion, Cutibacterium acnes proliferates within the pilosebaceous unit and induces an inflammatory reaction with the formation of papules, nodules, pustules, and/or cysts. Factors thought to contribute to the development of acne vulgaris include genetic susceptibility and environmental factors (e.g., diet, stress). Initial treatment of mild acne vulgaris usually consists of topical agents (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, retinoids); however, in a patient with significant acne-related psychological distress, adding systemic therapy (e.g., tetracycline) may be appropriate.","bool":true},{"option":"Colonization of hair follicles by gram-negative rods","explanation":"\nColonization of hair follicles by gram-negative rods, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can lead to folliculitis, which manifests with papules and pustules. However, pseudomonal folliculitis typically occurs shortly after exposure to contaminated water (often found in hot tubs), which this patient has no history of. Moreover, the lesions of pseudomonas folliculitis are located at the base of the hair follicles with one or multiple hairs emerging from the lesion; the face is usually spared. Finally, comedones are not seen in folliculitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperreactivity of cutaneous blood vessels","explanation":"Hyperreactivity of cutaneous blood vessels has been implicated in the pathogenesis of rosacea, which can also manifest with papules and pustules. However, skin manifestations in rosacea are more commonly localized to the central face rather than the forehead, and comedones are not present. Additional symptoms of rosacea include facial flushing and erythema, phymatous changes, and ocular involvement, none of which are seen in this patient. Finally, rosacea most commonly affects women over the age of 30 years.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Superficial infection with a dermatophytic fungus","explanation":"\nSuperficial infection with a dermatophytic fungus causes tinea, which can manifest with papules and pustules. However, tinea more commonly causes round, erythematous, pruritic plaques with raised borders and a central clearing. Furthermore, tinea typically spares the face and, instead, affects other areas of the skin (e.g., torso, groin, or feet), hair, or nails.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Mutation of a tumor supressor gene","explanation":"A mutation of a tumor suppressor gene is the underlying etiology of tuberous sclerosis, which can also manifest with erythematous papules on the face (adenoma sebaceous). However, these papules are more common around the nose and cheeks rather than the forehead and usually appear early in life (between 3–4 years of age). Additionally, comedones are not seen in patients with adenoma sebaceum. Finally, most patients with tuberous sclerosis present with neurological findings (e.g., epilepsy due to brain tumors, cognitive deficits, learning disabilities), which are not seen here.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Disseminated infection with a spirochete","explanation":"Disseminated infection with the spirochete Treponema pallidum causes secondary syphilis, which can also manifest with a nonpruritic papular rash that involves the back. However, the rash seen in patients with syphilis is more commonly maculopapular and generalized rather than papulopustular and confined to the face and back; in addition, the entire trunk, extremities, palms, and soles are usually affected, with the face typically being spared. Finally, this patient lacks additional features of secondary syphilis such as generalized lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, condylomata lata, and patchy alopecia.","bool":false},{"option":"Delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a topically applied substance","explanation":"\nDelayed hypersensitivity reaction to a topically applied substance is the underlying mechanism of allergic contact dermatitis, which can also manifest with a papular rash at the site of exposure to a cosmetic product. However, this condition presents 12–48 hours after repeated contact with an allergen rather than after initial contact and usually resolves with avoidance of the antigen; this patient has a 1-year history of cutaneous lesions. Additionally, the rash in contact dermatitis is often intensely pruritic, erythematous, and, in severe cases, vesicular; contact dermatitis does not manifest with comedones.","bool":false}]},{"id":3,"info":"Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue","question":"A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of a lesion in his left nostril.

Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The image shows destruction of the nasal mucosa with ulcerations extending to the nasal septum and skin. The causal organism is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies.","answers":[{"option":"Leishmania braziliensis","explanation":"\nCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) manifests as an ulcerating skin lesion at the site of a sandfly bite; the lesion gradually resolves without treatment. However, certain species of Leishmania (L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. panamensis) can cause mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) months to years after CL resolves. The nasopharynx is typically affected in ML, which can result in nasal blockage, mucosal bleeding, and/or septal destruction. Cervical lymphadenopathy can also occur. South America (especially Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil), where the patient emigrated from, is an endemic region for Leishmania species that cause ML. ML warrants systemic therapy using amphotericin B, miltefosine, or sodium stibogluconate.\nVisceral leishmaniasis, a more severe form of leishmaniasis, is primarily caused by Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum, both of which are also transmitted via sand flies. This form of leishmaniasis is also known as “kala-azar” (black fever in Hindi).","bool":true},{"option":"Trypanosoma brucei","explanation":"\nTrypanosoma brucei, which is transmitted by the tsetse fly, causes African trypanosomiasis. Following a tsetse fly bite, an ulcerating skin nodule (trypanosomal chancre) with regional lymphadenopathy would develop at the site of T. brucei inoculation, and this primary lesion would resolve spontaneously within 1–2 weeks. However, nasal ulceration is not consistent with this condition. Instead, constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise, weight loss) and neurological symptoms (e.g., personality changes, altered sleep-wake cycle, ataxia, delayed hyperesthesia) would be expected. Furthermore, African trypanosomiasis is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, not South America, where this patient emigrated from.","bool":false},{"option":"Histoplasma capsulatum","explanation":"\nHistoplasma capsulatum infection (histoplasmosis) can manifest with lymphadenopathy and skin nodules in the case of disseminated disease. However, the lesions of histoplasmosis do not resolve spontaneously, and ulcerations within the skin nodules or nasal ulcerations are uncommon. Palatal or lingual ulcers would be expected instead. Also, most patients with histoplasmosis are typically immunocompromised and present with fever, fatigue, weight loss, pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough), and/or hepatosplenomegaly. Moreover, histoplasmosis is commonly transmitted via exposure to bird and bat droppings commonly found along the river valleys of Mississippi, not in California, where this patient lives.","bool":false},{"option":"Mycobacterium leprae","explanation":"\nMycobacterium leprae infection (leprosy) can manifest with ulceration of the nasal mucosa and ulcerating skin nodules.

The most likely causal organism of this patient's clinical findings is also involved in the pathogenesis of which of the following conditions?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient presents with fever and tender, unilateral lymphadenopathy 2 weeks after exposure to animals. The linear crusts on his hand are likely from an animal scratch that introduced the organism responsible for his symptoms. These features indicate a diagnosis of cat scratch disease, which is caused by Bartonella henselae. The presence of necrotizing granulomas on histopathologic examination confirms the diagnosis.","answers":[{"option":"Bacillary angiomatosis","explanation":"\nBacillary angiomatosis is caused by Bartonella henselae (as well as Bartonella quintana) and typically manifests with proliferative, vascular lesions on the skin. The characteristic lesions are small, red-purple papules that can expand into larger, pedunculated lesions that have a tendency to bleed. Unlike cat scratch disease, which can affect immunocompetent individuals (such as this previously healthy boy), bacillary angiomatosis typically affects individuals who are immunosuppressed.","bool":true},{"option":"Kaposi sarcoma","explanation":"\nKaposi sarcoma is caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), not Bartonella henselae. Kaposi sarcoma typically manifests with purple or dark brown/black macules, plaques, and nodules on the skin.

A topical drug with which of the following mechanisms of action is most likely to be effective?","difficulty":4,"hint":"Pruritic, excoriated, erythematous papules with scattered vesicles on the interdigital folds and dorsum of the hand are a classic sign of scabies, which typically occurs in individuals living in crowded conditions (e.g., prisons, homeless shelters, nursing homes). Pruritis caused by scabies is often worse at night. Scabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and transmitted by direct human-to-human contact.","answers":[{"option":"Binding to sodium channels","explanation":"\nInhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels is the mechanism of action of permethrin, the first-line therapy for scabies. The blockade of sodium channels results in delayed repolarization of neuron cell membranes, which causes paralysis and death of the mite. Topical lindane solution is an alternative for the treatment of scabies. It inhibits GABA release and causes neurotoxicity and mite death.\nOral ivermectin is another alternative treatment for scabies and is especially indicated in large outbreaks or severe forms of scabies.","bool":true},{"option":"Inhibition of histamine-1 receptors","explanation":"Inhibition of histamine-1 receptors is the mechanism of action of H1 antihistamines. Although an antihistamine would provide symptomatic relief for the itching and burning, it would not treat the disease, as it would not kill the Sarcoptes scabiei mite.","bool":false},{"option":"Inhibition of nuclear factor-κB","explanation":"Inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is the mechanism of action of corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone) are usually reserved for severe disease, especially when concomitant dermatitis is present. However, it would not kill the Sarcoptes scabiei mite.","bool":false},{"option":"Binding to ergosterol","explanation":"Binding of ergosterol, which creates pores on the cell membrane of fungi and disrupts the electrolyte balance, is the mechanism of action of amphotericin B and nystatin. These medications are not indicated for the treatment of scabies. Nystatin is commonly used as a swish and swallow for oropharyngeal candidiasis and, topically, for vaginal candidiasis and diaper rash. Amphotericin B is used for severe systemic mycosis (e.g., aspergillosis). Neither drug is effective against Sarcoptes scabiei.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Decrease in peptidoglycan synthesis","explanation":"Decrease in peptidoglycan synthesis is the mechanism of action of bacitracin and mupirocin. These agents are topical antibiotics that have no effect against the Sarcoptes scabiei mite.","bool":false},{"option":"Increase in keratinocyte turnover","explanation":"Increase keratinocyte turnover is the mechanism of action of topical retinoids, vitamin A derivatives.

UV light interacts with metabolites of the phototoxic drug, resulting in the release of reactive oxygen species to the surrounding area and subsequent inflammation and damage of the sun-exposed skin. Vesicles or bullae can also occur. Unlike photoallergic drug reactions, phototoxic drug reactions occur without prior sensitization to the triggering agent and typically develop within minutes to hours of sun exposure.\nTreatment of phototoxic drug reaction includes discontinuation of the triggering drug, photoprotective measures, and symptomatic treatment (e.g., with wet compresses).","bool":true},{"option":"Paraneoplasic dermatomyositis","explanation":"\nDermatomyositis is frequently associated with malignancies, including lung cancer. Paraneoplastic dermatomyositis would also involve photosensitivity. However, this patient does not have muscle weakness, which is a defining feature of this disorder.","bool":false},{"option":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","explanation":"\nSystemic lupus erythematosus often manifests with photosensitivity, and the skin findings in this patient are particularly often seen in drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus. Drugs that are known to cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus include procainamide, hydralazine, methyldopa, phenytoin, chlorpromazine, diltiazem, and isoniazid. However, none of the drugs currently taken by the patient are known to induce a lupus reaction.","bool":false},{"option":"Uroporphyrin accumulation","explanation":"\nPorphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is caused by a defect in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase that results in the accumulation of uroporphyrin. The typical cutaneous manifestations of PCT are a photosensitive blistering rash and increased skin fragility, not erythema, and papular eruptions. Moreover, these symptoms typically occur as a delayed reaction several hours after sunlight exposure and would be unlikely to develop only 30 minutes after exposure.","bool":false},{"option":"Normal sunburn reaction","explanation":"Although this patient is light-skinned and does have a history of sunburns, it would be unlikely for a sunburn to appear 30 minutes after a short, 10-minute exposure to sunlight.","bool":false},{"option":"Cell-mediated photoallergic reaction","explanation":"A cell-mediated photoallergic reaction is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction that can occur in patients taking medications such as antibacterial sulfonamides or anticonvulsants. More commonly, however, photoallergy occurs after exposure to topical agents, such as sunscreen, diclofenac, and perfume. Photoallergic reactions are delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and therefore typically occur 48–72 hours after exposure to sunlight; this patient has had an acute reaction.","bool":false},{"option":"Adverse reaction to amoxicillin","explanation":"While an allergic reaction to amoxicillin could result in erythema and papular eruptions, the fact that the rash appeared within 30 minutes of exposure to sunlight and is limited to sun-exposed areas points to a different diagnosis.

Injections are typically administered monthly until hair regrowth is complete. Individuals who do not tolerate intralesional injections can be treated with topical steroids. Patients with extensive alopecia areata are often treated with topical immunotherapy (e.g., diphenylcyclopropenone or squaric acid dibutyl ester). Not all patients with alopecia areata respond to treatment, and the rate of recurrence is high. Since hair loss can cause severe distress, psychological support is an important component of therapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Oral finasteride therapy","explanation":"Oral finasteride is the treatment of choice for androgenic alopecia, a type of chronic hair loss caused by increased androgen sensitivity of the hair follicles in genetically predisposed individuals. Although androgenic alopecia can manifest during adolescence with progressive, nonscarring hair loss, affected individuals typically have gradual, bitemporal hair thinning (i.e., male pattern baldness) rather than rapid, patchy hair loss. Moreover, the hair pull test is typically negative in patients with androgenic alopecia. Oral finasteride is not used to treat alopecia areata.","bool":false},{"option":"Topical minoxidil therapy","explanation":"Topical minoxidil is a treatment option for androgenic alopecia and telogen effluvium, both of which can manifest with progressive, nonscarring hair loss. Telogen effluvium can develop rapidly following severe emotional stress (e.g., the loss of a loved one). However, both conditions typically manifest with diffuse hair loss most noticeable in the bitemporal region, whereas this patient has multiple smooth, well-defined bald patches across the scalp. The hair pull test is usually positive in patients with telogen effluvium and negative in patients with androgenic alopecia. Topical minoxidil therapy is sometimes used in patients with alopecia areata if the cause of hair loss is suspected to be multifactorial (e.g., concurrent telogen effluvium), but it is not the treatment of choice.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral terbinafine therapy","explanation":"Oral antifungal therapy (e.g., terbinafine or griseofulvin) is the treatment of choice for tinea capitis, a dermatophyte infection that primarily occurs in children and can manifest with nonscarring, patchy alopecia with visible black spots. However, in tinea capitis, the affected scalp areas are scaly and erythematous. In addition, pruritus and cervical lymphadenopathy are common. Moreover, the hair pull test is typically negative in patients with tinea capitis. Oral antifungal therapy is not used to treat alopecia areata.","bool":false},{"option":"Habit reversal therapy","explanation":"\nHabit reversal therapy is the treatment of choice for trichotillomania, a disorder characterized by the compulsion to pull out one's hair, which leads to nonscarring, patchy hair loss. This condition can manifest in adolescence, develop in association with a stressful event (e.g., loss of a loved one), and is associated with other psychiatric disorders (e.g., panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder). However, the bald scalp areas are typically ill-defined and diffuse with hairs of varying length due to different points of breakage and/or pulling at different times, whereas this patient has areas of smooth, well-defined bald patches. Moreover, the hair pull test is typically negative in patients with trichotillomania. Habit reversal therapy is not used to treat alopecia areata.","bool":false},{"option":"Benzathine penicillin G therapy","explanation":"Benzathine penicillin G therapy is the treatment of choice for syphilis, which occasionally manifests with nonscarring patchy hair loss during the second stage of the disease. Sexual activity with multiple partners and inconsistent condom use increases the risk for sexually transmitted infections. However, hair loss associated with secondary syphilis typically produces a moth-eaten appearance, not the smooth, well-defined bald patches seen here. Moreover, this patient does not have further symptoms of syphilis, such as a polymorphic rash, condyloma lata, and, most importantly, constitutional symptoms (e.g., generalized nontender lymphadenopathy, fever, fatigue, myalgia).

She follows a vegan diet that consists mainly of spinach, kale, and sweet potatoes. Physical examination shows yellowing of the skin. Her hands are cold to the touch and her nails appear brittle. Eye examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following findings is most likely in this patient's serum?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Notably, this patient does not present with scleral icterus.","answers":[{"option":"Increased beta-carotene concentration","explanation":"\nIncreased beta-carotene concentration causes pseudojaundice, which manifests with yellow discoloration of the skin, especially in the hands, soles, forehead, and nose because beta-carotene accumulates in the skin's epidermis; the sclerae and mucous membranes are spared, as seen here. Carotenemia can result from excessive consumption of sweet potatoes, leafy greens, carrots, and oranges; increased intake of carotene-rich supplements may also cause carotenemia. This patient's weight gain, fatigue, brittle nails, and cold skin indicates hypothyroidism, which leads to reduced production of vitamin A from beta-carotene due to lack of thyroxine, thereby further increasing beta-carotene levels.","bool":true},{"option":"Increased alkaline phosphatase concentration","explanation":"Increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration occurs in obstructive jaundice, which also leads to yellow skin discoloration through the accumulation of bilirubin in the subcutaneous fat tissue. However, hyperbilirubinemia would also cause jaundice of the sclerae and mucous membranes (before it is visible on the skin), which this patient notably lacks. Additionally, typical signs of cholestasis such as pale stools, dark urine, pruritus, and symptoms of fat malabsorption (e.g., steatorrhea, weight loss) are absent in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Decreased haptoglobin concentration","explanation":"Decreased haptoglobin concentration occurs in hemolysis, which results in yellow skin discoloration through deposition of bilirubin, a degradation product of hemoglobin, in the subcutaneous fat tissue.

The most common malignancy of the lower lip is cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), which typically manifests in chronically sun-exposed areas. 95% of malignancies of the lower lip are SCCs. SCC typically begins as a papule and then becomes a friable ulcer with everted borders that bleeds readily. Other risk factors for SCC of the lower lip include HIV and immunosuppressive therapy.","bool":true},{"option":"Basal cell carcinoma","explanation":"\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cutaneous malignancy in the US. This carcinoma has a higher incidence in light-skinned individuals and tends to affect areas exposed to the sun (e.g., the lip). However, BCC is not the most common cause of lip cancer; it only accounts for approx. 5% of cases. In addition, BCC more commonly manifests on the upper lip than on the lower lip. Moreover, BCC usually has a pearly appearance and a very slow growth rate (many months to years), neither of which is seen in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Traumatic ulcer","explanation":"Traumatic ulcers of the lower lip can be painless and manifest with ulceration of the lip, which are features seen in this patient. However, these ulcers usually resolve within 1–2 weeks, while this patient has had his ulcer for 3 months.

This patient's deformed and brittle nails, however, are distinct from periungual fibromas, which appear as smooth, flesh-colored nodules.","bool":false},{"option":"Pallor of the conjunctival mucosa","explanation":"\nPallor of the conjunctival mucosa is a common feature in patients with anemia (e.g., due to iron deficiency anemia). Iron deficiency anemia can also cause nail changes, including brittle nails. However, patients with iron deficiency anemia typically present with koilonychia, which is not seen in this patient. Furthermore, anemia significant enough to cause nail changes would also be likely to cause additional symptoms such as fatigue, which is not present here.","bool":false},{"option":"Erosions of the dental enamel","explanation":"\nErosions of the dental enamel are typically seen in patients with bulimia. These patients can present with dorsal hand calluses, which are known as the Russell sign. While brittle nails may be seen, bulimia is not associated with the nail pitting seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border","explanation":"A holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border would be suggestive of ventricular septal defect (VSD). While patients with VSD may show nail clubbing, nail pitting would be unexpected.

Two days ago, she was camping outdoors in Texas with her two young children. She was awoken in the middle of the night by “something crawling on my hand.” The following morning, she saw a wound on her hand that was initially painless, but over the next several hours she noticed reddening and blistering. Yesterday, the lesion turned blue with a blackish discoloration at the center. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema at the dorsum of the right hand. Which of the following animals is most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This animal is most easily identified by the violin-shaped marking on its back.","answers":[{"option":"Brown recluse spider","explanation":"\nBrown recluse spiders are endemic to some regions of the southern (e.g., Texas), southeastern, and midwestern United States. They produce venom composed of various enzymes, some of which cause local destruction of tissue integrity, leading to the breakdown of skin, adipose tissue, vasculature, and eventual tissue death. Bites are initially painless but form into an erythematous, painful blister over the course of several hours. Progressive tissue death and bluish-black skin discoloration are seen in the first 24 hours, followed by tissue necrosis and eschar formation by the end of the first week. Systemic findings, although uncommon, include fever, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. Life-threatening complications are extremely rare. Treatment consists of cleansing the wound, analgesics for pain, and tetanus prophylaxis. Antimicrobials are indicated if the wound becomes infected. In severe necrotic lesions, tissue debridement may be necessary.","bool":true},{"option":"Deer tick","explanation":"Deer ticks, which are most commonly found in the northeastern United States, are vectors for Lyme disease. Although early manifestations of Lyme disease may include a painless red rash (erythema migrans) and flu-like symptoms such as the low-grade fever seen in this patient, progressive tissue destruction characterized by bluish-black discoloration and skin necrosis would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Diamondback rattlesnake","explanation":"Diamondback rattlesnakes are found throughout the southwestern United States, including the state of Texas. Their bite is very painful and their venom contains hemotoxic, cytotoxic, and myotoxic proteins, which lead to localized progressive edema, ecchymoses, internal bleeding, muscle damage, and necrosis. More severe effects include disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, and death.","bool":false},{"option":"Bald-faced hornet","explanation":"Bald-faced hornets are found throughout North America, especially in the southern United States, including the state of Texas. Although their sting typically causes signs of local inflammation (erythema, induration), bluish-black skin discoloration and skin necrosis are not expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Black widow spider","explanation":"Black widow spiders are endemic to the state of Texas. Their bite typically begins as a painful erythematous macule, which progresses to form a “target lesion” with a pale center surrounded by erythema. Their venom causes exocytosis of neurotransmitters from presynaptic nerve terminals, which leads to muscle pain and spasms, severe abdominal pain with rigidity, paresthesias, and autonomic dysfunction, none of which are present in this patient. In addition, progressive tissue destruction characterized by bluish-black discoloration and skin necrosis would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Striped bark scorpion","explanation":"Striped bark scorpions are endemic to the state of Texas. Their sting is typically painful and causes localized swelling at the sting site. Neurotoxins produced in the venom may cause paresthesia and muscle spasms. In severe cases, cranial nerve dysfunction, neuromuscular dysfunction, and/or hypersensitivity reactions may occur. A painless erythematous lesion that leads to progressive tissue destruction characterized by bluish-black discoloration and skin necrosis, as seen in this patient, would not be expected.","bool":false}]},{"id":20,"info":"Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue","question":"A 6-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a generalized pruritic rash for 3 days.

Calamine lotion (active ingredient is zinc oxide) is an antipruritic drug that can be used to decrease itching. Antihistamines can also be used to control pruritus. To prevent scratching and secondary bacterial infection of the vesicle, the child's fingernails should be kept short.","bool":true},{"option":"Acyclovir therapy","explanation":"\nAntiviral therapy with acyclovir for chickenpox in children ≤ 12 years of age is only indicated if the child is at a high risk of developing complications; for example, those taking intermittent/chronic glucocorticoids (risk of disseminated varicella infection and complications like pneumonia), those taking long-term salicylates (risk of Reye syndrome), and in those who have a pre-existing skin/pulmonary disease (risk of secondary bacterial infection). Since this child has none of the above-mentioned risk factors, acyclovir therapy is not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Tzanck test","explanation":"A Tzanck test is indicated when the clinical diagnosis of a blistering skin disease is unclear (e.g., in atypical or complicated disease). The test can also be considered in children with a diffuse vesicular rash if the clinical diagnosis is in doubt.

Unlike this child's maculopapular and vesicular rash with crusted lesions, the characteristic rash of scarlet fever is fine, erythematous, sandpaper-like, and blanches on pressure. Also, children with scarlet fever usually have odynophagia, inflamed pharyngeal mucosa, and cervical lymphadenopathy, all of which are absent here.","bool":false},{"option":"Measles IgM titer","explanation":"Although measles presents with fever and rash, the characteristic measles rash is erythematous, maculopapular, and lacks vesicles or crusted lesions. Also, children with measles typically feel very ill and have generalized lymphadenopathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Rubella IgM titer","explanation":"Although rubella presents with fever and a maculopapular rash, children with rubella typically also have postauricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy and a flu-like prodrome (sore throat, arthralgia). Additionally, vesicles and crusted lesions are not seen in rubella.","bool":false},{"option":"Vitamin A therapy","explanation":"\nVitamin A supplementation is recommended by the WHO for children infected with the measles virus. Vitamin A enhances the barrier function of ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal epithelium, and has been proven to decrease the severity of measles infection. Although measles can also present with fever and rash, crusted/vesicular lesions are not seen. Children with measles typically feel more ill and have generalized lymphadenopathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Penicillin therapy","explanation":"Oral penicillin is the treatment of choice for scarlet fever, which also presents with fever and a generalized pruritic rash.

The colony-producing bacteria are oxidase-positive. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for the patient's condition?","difficulty":2,"hint":"MacConkey agar only allows growth of gram-negative organisms. While lactose-fermenting bacteria produce bright pink colonies on this agar, lactose nonfermenters grow in neutral colors. This patient's papulopustular skin eruptions are most likely caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative, lactose non-fermenting, oxidase-positive bacillus.","answers":[{"option":"Swimming in pool","explanation":"This patient's clinical symptoms (mild fever, pruritic rash, and skin eruptions) are classical findings of hot tub folliculitis, an infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While typically dependent on direct inoculation (such as nail puncture wounds) or an immunocompromised host to cause an infection, the most common route of pseudomonal infection in immunocompetent hosts is contact with water (hot tub, lake, pool). Pseudomonal folliculitis is a self-limiting condition, but antibiotic treatment may be warranted in severe cases.","bool":true},{"option":"Outdoor camping","explanation":"Outdoor activities like camping increase the risk for tick-borne illnesses, such as Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi) or Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF; caused by Rickettsia rickettsii). Although both conditions can cause malaise, fever, and rash, neither would present with the painful, pruritic skin eruptions seen in this patient. Early Lyme disease manifests with a painless “bull's eye” rash, whereas RMSF shows a blanching macular rash that spreads from wrists and ankles to the trunk. Infection with R. rickettsii and B. burgdorferi is typically confirmed by serological testing, and neither pathogen is known to grow on MacConkey agar.","bool":false},{"option":"Cat bite","explanation":"Infections following cat bites are most commonly caused by Pasteurella multocida. Unlike this patient's multiple, pruritic skin eruptions, an infection typically causes painful cellulitis at the inoculation site. Despite their gram-negative nature, Pasteurella spp. do not grow on MacConkey agar. Cat bites can also cause cat scratch disease due to transmission of Bartonella  henselae . However, while B. henselae are gram-negative bacteria, they are oxidase-negative organisms. Furthermore, the location of the papulopustular eruptions and the absence of regional lymphadenopathy are not consistent with cat scratch disease.","bool":false},{"option":"Unprotected sexual intercourse","explanation":"Unprotected sexual intercourse poses a risk for sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis (caused by Treponema pallidum). Secondary syphilis presents with fever, malaise, and a polymorphic disseminated rash that often involves the trunk. However, this patient's rash is typically nonpruritic and follows the development of a primary genital lesion (chancre). Moreover, T. pallidum is best viewed with darkfield microscopy and in vitro cultivation of the organism is not possible. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not transmitted via sexual intercourse.","bool":false},{"option":"Rose pruning","explanation":"The fungus Sporothrix schenckii can be transmitted through puncture wounds caused by rose thorns. Cutaneous sporotrichosis typically manifests as erythematous nodules or ulcers at the initial site of exposure (typically the upper extremity), unlike the multiple, pruritic skin eruptions seen on this patient's thigh. Moreover, MacConkey agar is used to evaluate bacteria, not fungi.","bool":false},{"option":"Skin-to-skin contact","explanation":"Several bacterial infections can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, including staphylococcal and streptococcal skin infections such as impetigo or folliculitis. However, gram-positive bacteria do not grow on MacConkey agar.

She was stung a few hours ago at tennis practice when she inadvertently picked up a ball with a honeybee on it. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She has no allergies, takes no medications, and her immunizations are up-to-date. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 106/68 mm Hg. Examination shows a stinger with the attached venom sac in her right forearm. There is an area of erythema and swelling of approximately 1 cm in diameter at the sting site that is tender to palpation. The physician scrapes off the stinger with a piece of gauze, washes the sting site with soap and water, and applies a cold compress. In addition to prescribing analgesics and asking the patient to keep the right forearm elevated, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient presents with a small area (&lt; 5 cm in diameter) of erythema and swelling around a Hymenoptera sting site, indicating an uncomplicated local reaction.","answers":[{"option":"No further management is indicated at this time","explanation":"Uncomplicated local reactions to a Hymenoptera sting only require symptomatic treatment to limit the inflammatory reaction and reduce the pain. The inflammatory reaction to a sting is induced by the venom released from the venom sac of Hymenoptera's stinging apparatus. Since the venom is expelled during the first few minutes after a sting, immediate stinger removal (only applied to Hymenoptera species that lose their stingers after stinging, like honeybees) might limit venom release. Sting removal can be done by scraping off the stinger with a piece of gauze or fingernail but not with tweezers, because of the risk of further squeezing the venom sac. Following removal, the site should be washed with soap and water, cold compresses should be applied, and NSAIDs can be used for pain relief. If present, pruritus can be treated with oral antihistamines or topical steroids. In patients with large local reactions (&gt; 10 cm in diameter), oral steroids can be used.","bool":true},{"option":"Administer epinephrine","explanation":"\nEpinephrine is used in the treatment of anaphylaxis, which can be triggered by Hymenoptera stings. This patient, however, does not have typical findings of anaphylaxis, such as urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, or hypotension. Epinephrine can also be administered following a sting in patients with a history of sting-induced anaphylaxis, which is not the case here. Patients with sting-induced anaphylaxis should be prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector prior to discharge and instructed on how and when to use it.","bool":false},{"option":"Admit the patient for observation","explanation":"Observation in a hospital setting is indicated to monitor patients who were previously treated for sting-induced anaphylaxis or are at risk for developing an anaphylactic reaction. This patient, however, only has a localized skin reaction, which does not require observation in a hospital setting.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform allergic skin testing","explanation":"Allergic skin testing is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy in patients with a history of a systemic allergic reaction following a Hymenoptera sting. In patients with local skin reactions, there is no indication for allergic skin testing because the probability of developing a systemic life-threatening reaction is low. Moreover, in patients with no history of a systemic allergic reaction, a positive skin test is neither diagnostic nor predicts the risk of developing a systemic reaction following a sting, since more than a quarter of the general population has venom-specific IgE antibodies but only a minority actually reports systemic reactions.","bool":false},{"option":"Administer oral prednisone","explanation":"Oral prednisone is used in the treatment of large local reactions (LLR) to Hymenoptera stings, which manifest with an area of erythema and painful swelling greater than approx. 10 cm in diameter.

In the case of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy should be initiated in conjunction with the treatment of skin lesions. Treatment for disseminated molluscum contagiosum includes cryotherapy, curettage, subcutaneous interferon alpha, and systemic treatment (e.g., intravenous cidofovir). A reasonable initial approach for this patient is to treat the largest and/or most bothersome lesions with cryotherapy, which is a destructive method that can also stimulate an enhanced immune response to viral antigens.","bool":true},{"option":"Reassure the patient that the lesions will resolve and recommend follow-up","explanation":"\nMolluscum contagiosum is typically a self-limited disease. However, this patient has widespread involvement, which is consistent with disseminated molluscum contagiosum and unlikely to resolve on its own. She, therefore, requires further management.","bool":false},{"option":"Recommend curettage of the lesions","explanation":"\nCurettage is commonly used to treat localized molluscum contagiosum. Curettage of select lesions (e.g., the most bothersome lesions) may be a reasonable initial approach for this patient with disseminated molluscum contagiosum, but it may also result in multiple, large wounds that increase the risk of developing other infections. In addition, treatment alone without evaluation of possible immune system dysfunction is inappropriate in patients with extensive lesions.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform a urine pregnancy test and recommend systemic retinoid therapy","explanation":"Systemic retinoid therapy with isotretinoin is indicated to treat severe acne vulgaris but is not used to treat molluscum contagiosum. Severe acne vulgaris typically manifests with tender, inflammatory papules, pustules, and cysts on the face and trunk, which this patient does not have. A urine pregnancy test is indicated prior to initiating isotretinoin therapy because of the drug's teratogenic effects.","bool":false},{"option":"Recommend systemic itraconazole therapy","explanation":"Systemic itraconazole therapy can be used to treat invasive fungal infections (e.g., blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis) but is not used to treat molluscum contagiosum, which is caused by a poxvirus. Disseminated fungal infections can manifest with a widespread papular eruption, but they typically have more variable findings (e.g., nodules, ulcers, pustules). In addition, disseminated fungal infections commonly also cause extracutaneous symptoms, such as fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and weight loss, which this patient does not have.","bool":false},{"option":"Recommend topical salicylic acid therapy","explanation":"Topical salicylic acid is a desquamating agent used as second-line therapy for localized molluscum contagiosum; it is not an appropriate therapy for this patient with disseminated molluscum contagiosum. Salicylic acid is also commonly used to treat acne vulgaris and verruca vulgaris. Acne vulgaris typically manifests with tender, inflammatory papules and pustules on the face.

Vitamin A enhances the barrier function and immunity of the ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal epithelium. Lower serum levels of vitamin A are associated with a more severe and prolonged course of the disease.\nThe small white or bluish-gray spot on the buccal mucosa (Koplik spots) that are pathognomonic for measles typically appear in the prodromal phase of the disease. Perhaps this patient had Koplik spots, but they typically fade as the rash appears.","bool":true},{"option":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","explanation":"IVIG can be used as postexposure prophylaxis (within 6 days of exposure) for measles in infants younger than 12 months of age, pregnant women without evidence of measles immunity, and people with severely compromised immune systems. As, in this patient, the disease is already in the exanthem stage, it is now too late for postexposure prophylaxis. Another possible indication for IVIG would be Kawasaki disease, but the child does not have the characteristic strawberry tongue and rash with palmar and plantar desquamation.","bool":false},{"option":"Live-attenuated vaccine","explanation":"While the MMR vaccine is a live-attenuated vaccine, it has no benefit during the exanthem phase of measles and is, in fact, contraindicated if the child has a high fever, as in this case.

Primary HSV infection in children typically presents as gingivostomatitis with bloody gingival ulcerations and mucosal blisters. Cervical lymphadenopathy, but not generalized lymphadenopathy, may be present. Furthermore, facial rash is not typical for HSV infection. VZV infection (chickenpox) presents with a widespread rash that starts on the trunk, and eventually spreads to the face, scalp, and extremities as opposed to the progression from face to trunk seen in this patient. In VZV infection, the various stages of the rash typically occur simultaneously.

It is caused by a type II hypersensitivity reaction from antibodies created against streptoccocal M protein, which cross-react with proteins of the heart, joints, and nerves through molecular mimicry. While this patient has pharyngitis, skin rash, and fever, these symptoms are unlikely to be due to rheumatic fever since there is no evidence of joint and cardiac involvement, Sydenham chorea, subcutaneous nodules, or skin nodules (JONES criteria). Rheumatic fever manifests with an evanescent rash with well delineated ring-shaped margins (erythema marginatum).","bool":false},{"option":"Drug-induced type IV hypersensitivity reaction","explanation":"\nType IV hypersensitivity is a T cell-mediated reaction that manifests with a erythematous maculopapular skin rash, as in this patient. However, it is unlikely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms, as drug eruptions are intensely pruritic and do not present with circumoral pallor or a red tongue. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions occur after use of topical antibiotics such as neomycin, contact with urushiol (e.g. in poison ivy), or contact with latex (i.e., latex gloves).","bool":false},{"option":"Bacterial invasion of the deep dermis","explanation":"Bacterial invasion of the deep dermis manifests as cellulitis, a skin infection caused by group A streptococci. Skin infections usually result from minor skin injuries (e.g., cuts, blisters, scratches), which allow bacteria to spread through superficial lymphatic vessels, resulting in skin rash and fever. However, cellulitis is unlikely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms, since the rash in cellulitis is limited to the site of infection rather than generalized.","bool":false},{"option":"Subepithelial immune complex deposition","explanation":"\nPoststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is caused by subepithelial immune complex deposition within the glomerular basement membrane, resulting in complement activation, destruction of the glomeruli, and nephritic syndrome. It usually occurs 10–30 days after an acute infection of the skin (impetigo) or the pharynx (pharyngitis) and manifests with hematuria, hypertension, flank pain, and edema. Since this patient only has a 3-day history of sore throat and no evidence of nephritic syndrome, PSGN is very unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Paramyxovirus-induced cell damage","explanation":"\nParamyxovirus-induced cell damage is seen in measles (rubeola), which presents with a generalized, erythematous, and maculopapular skin rash, as seen in this patient.

PSGN typically arises 10–30 days following infection, with features of nephritic syndrome, such as hematuria, edema, and hypertension.\nFurther complications of group A streptococcal infections include rheumatic fever and scarlet fever. Although scarlet fever occurs in very rare cases after streptococcal skin infections such as impetigo, both conditions are typically only associated with streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.","bool":true},{"option":"Rheumatic fever","explanation":"\nRheumatic fever is a noninfectious, inflammatory sequela of untreated acute tonsillopharyngitis caused by group A streptococci.

Group A streptococcal infections such as impetigo are not known to trigger reactive arthritis.","bool":false},{"option":"Shingles","explanation":"\nShingles is caused by a reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals after a primary VZV infection (i.e., chickenpox). Chickenpox presents with a highly pruritic rash that classically appear in different stages (from vesicles to crusts) and that covers the entire body. Although the lack of vaccinations puts this child at risk for VZV infection, his presentation and elevated anti-DNase B antibody titer are inconsistent with chickenpox.","bool":false},{"option":"Orchitis","explanation":"\nOrchitis is a typical complication of viral mumps infection. Given the lack of vaccinations, this child is at increased risk of contracting mumps.

Although these lesions are generally benign, the sudden development of multiple SKs may indicate an underlying malignancy (referred to as the Leser-Trélat sign).","bool":true},{"option":"Dysplastic nevus","explanation":"A dysplastic nevus is a benign skin lesion that can occur in all age groups and is often seen in individuals with a genetic disposition (e.g., light skin, multiple common moles). The lesion may be flat or raised and is characterized by an asymmetric shape, irregular borders, and inconsistencies in color. The wax-like, greasy appearance of this patient's lesions is not consistent with dysplastic nevi.","bool":false},{"option":"Dermatofibroma","explanation":"\nDermatofibromas are benign skin lesions of unknown etiology that may occur in any age group. They most commonly manifest on the lower legs as skin-colored or brownish nodules and are characterized by the presence of dimple sign. This patient's dark, wax-like lesions suggest a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Actinic keratosis","explanation":"\nActinic keratosis is a UV-induced precancerous skin lesion that initially presents with a sandpaper-like texture and progresses to erythematous, scaly lesions. While this patient's work as a gardener places him at increased risk of developing actinic keratosis, the lesions' greasy, wax-like appearance and the location of one on a body part that is not typically sun-exposed (lower back) make this diagnosis unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Lentigo maligna","explanation":"\nLentigo maligna (LM) is a precancerous skin lesion caused by long-term exposure to sunlight. While this patient's risk of developing malignant skin lesions is increased, LM manifests as an irregularly shaped, dark macula, unlike the sharply demarcated nodules seen in this patient. Since one of this patient's lesions is on skin that is not sun-exposed (lower back), this diagnosis is very unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Compound nevus","explanation":"A compound nevus is a benign skin lesion similar in appearance to common moles but usually lighter in color. The fact that it consists of a central raised area surrounded by a flat patch of pigmented skin makes it similar to this patient's lesion, but the dark pigmentation and waxy appearance, in this case, are more suggestive of a different diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Basal cell carcinoma","explanation":"\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a malignant skin tumor primarily associated with long-term exposure to sunlight and typically occurs on the nose or eyelids. The lesion manifests as a slow-growing pearly nodule with a rolled border and central depression that may ulcerate. While this patient has a history of occupational exposure to sunlight, the appearance and swift development of his lesions, as well as the distribution of one of them on the lower back, rule out BCC.","bool":false}]},{"id":36,"info":"Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue","question":"A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician for evaluation of severe acne on her face, chest, and back for the past 2 years. She has no itching or scaling. She has been treated in the past with oral azithromycin and a topical combination of benzoyl peroxide and adapalene without clinical improvement. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows mild facial scarring and numerous open comedones and sebaceous skin lesions on her face, chest, and back. Before initiating treatment, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient with severe acne vulgaris has failed to respond to initial therapy. As a next step, treatment with an oral retinoid (e.g., isotretinoin) should be initiated.","answers":[{"option":"Measure serum beta-hCG concentration","explanation":"Two separate serum or urine pregnancy tests should be performed in all female patients prior to systemic therapy with retinoids because this group of drugs is extremely teratogenic. If the initial pregnancy tests are negative, an approved form of primary contraception (e.g., IUD, combined oral contraceptive pill) and a secondary barrier method (e.g., condoms, cervical cap plus spermicide, diaphragm plus spermicide) must be used for a month before initiating oral retinoid therapy and continued up until one month after treatment is completed. Pregnancy tests should be repeated monthly while systemic retinoid therapy is ongoing and one month after ceasing therapy.\nThis patient should also undergo liver function and lipid profile tests (both before and during therapy) since the use of retinoids is associated with impaired liver function and hyperlipidemia.","bool":true},{"option":"Switch azithromycin to doxycycline","explanation":"\nTetracyclines such as doxycycline should be avoided in patients receiving systemic treatment with retinoids because both drugs increase the risk of pseudotumor cerebri. If adjunctive antibiotic therapy is indicated (e.g., because of inflammatory acne), amoxicillin or cephalexin are acceptable agents.","bool":false},{"option":"Prescribe a progestin-only oral contraceptive","explanation":"Before initiating oral retinoid therapy in women of childbearing age, an approved form of primary contraception (e.g., combined oral contraceptive pill) and a secondary barrier method must be initiated. Progestin-only oral contraceptives are not as effective as combined oral contraceptive pills and are not recommended for contraception in patients taking oral retinoids. Moreover, a different step is necessary before combined oral contraceptive pills are initiated.\nCombined oral contraceptive pills have an antiandrogenic effect and can be used as an adjunct to treat severe inflammatory acne but progestin-only contraception can worsen acne.","bool":false},{"option":"Measure creatinine kinase levels","explanation":"Systemic retinoid therapy can occasionally result in rhabdomyolysis and increased creatinine kinase (CK) levels. CK levels should be measured if the patient develops myalgia during treatment, but routine pretherapeutic measurement is not necessary.","bool":false},{"option":"Screen for depression with a questionnaire","explanation":"Depression and suicidal ideation have been reported in patients taking retinoids, but current research does not support a causative link between this group of drugs and depression.

The patient reports intense itching. He was born at 39 weeks' gestation and has a history of atopic dermatitis. He attends junior high school and went on a camping trip with his school the day before yesterday. His older brother has celiac disease. Examination shows erythematous papules and vesicles that are arranged in a linear pattern on the right forearm. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This patient presents with pruritic, red skin lesions arranged in a linear pattern appearing 24 hours after a camping trip. These features suggest allergic contact dermatitis due to urushiol-containing plants, such as poison oak, poison ivy, or poison sumac.","answers":[{"option":"Presensitized T cells","explanation":"\nAllergic contact dermatitis is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs in two distinct phases preceding the appearance of symptoms. During initial contact with the allergen, the antigen penetrates the skin and is taken up by Langerhans cells, which then migrate to lymph nodes, inducing the formation of sensitized T lymphocytes (i.e., sensitization). On repeated contact with the allergen, these presensitized T lymphocytes secrete lymphokines, which cause macrophage activation and an inflammatory reaction in the tissue (i.e., rash). The rash typically develops 12– 48 hours following contact and is therefore classified as a delayed immune response. Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are common causes.\nOther typical causes include exposure to metals (e.g., nickel, cobalt, chromium), certain cosmetics (e.g., perfumes, soaps, sunscreens, hair dyes), latex, and topical medications (e.g., hydrocortisone, topical antibiotics, benzocaine).","bool":true},{"option":"Preformed IgE antibodies","explanation":"Preformed IgE antibodies play a role in type I hypersensitivity reactions. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are classified as immediate immune responses and occur within minutes of antigen exposure. Symptoms of type I hypersensitivity reactions include pruritus, edema, urticaria, rhinitis, and bronchospasm. Atopic dermatitis is caused by this type of reaction and may manifest as a pruritic rash (i.e., eczema). Although the patient has a history of atopic dermatitis, the associated rash typically presents with lichenified lesions in flexural creases (antecubital and popliteal fossae), skin folds, and the extensor surface of hands, rather than a papulovesicular rash on one forearm.","bool":false},{"option":"IgA deposits","explanation":"\nIgA and complement C3 deposits in dermal papillae can be found in dermatitis herpetiformis, which may manifest with tense, grouped subepidermal blisters, and intense pruritus over the extremities, shoulders, abdomen, and gluteal region. The patient is at increased risk of developing this condition, given his family history of celiac disease, which is commonly associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. However, the distribution of the skin lesions would typically be symmetrical rather than unilateral. Furthermore, this patient does not have any symptoms of celiac disease (e.g., anemia due to iron deficiency, short stature), making dermatitis herpetiformis less likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Immune complex formation","explanation":"\nImmune complex formation and deposition are the main mechanisms involved in type III hypersensitivity reactions. This type of reaction accounts for various immunological disorders including glomerulonephritides and vasculitides. Although symptoms may vary depending on the specific disorder, they tend to be systemic rather than localized, making this mechanism an unlikely cause of the patient's findings.","bool":false},{"option":"IgG antibodies against desmoglein","explanation":"In individuals with pemphigus vulgaris, IgG antibodies directed against desmoglein 3 and desmoglein 1 account for the autoimmune reaction resulting in the formation of classic skin findings. In contrast to the patient's localized papulovesicular rash, pemphigus vulgaris manifests with painful, flaccid, intraepidermal blisters that rupture early and form erosions and crusts. Moreover, the lesions of pemphigus vulgaris typically present in individuals between 30–60 years of age initially on the oral mucosa, followed by body parts exposed to pressure (e.g., intertriginous areas).","bool":false},{"option":"IgG antibodies against hemidesmosomes","explanation":"A cytotoxic (i.e., type II hypersensitivity) reaction between IgG antibodies and hemidesmosomes in the epithelial basement membrane is the pathomechanism of bullous pemphigoid. Although bullous pemphigoid may present with localized pruritic skin lesions, the typical examination findings include large, tense, subepidermal blisters on palms, soles, lower legs, groin, and axillae.

Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There are two tender, blanchable erythemas without blisters over a 5 x 6-cm area of the left abdomen and a 3 x 2-cm area of the left anterior thigh. There is also an area of white, leathery skin and tissue necrosis encircling the right upper extremity just proximal to the elbow, which is dry and nontender.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This patient has a 3rd degree (full-thickness) circumferential burn on her right upper extremity, as indicated by the encircling white, leathery skin and necrosis without feeling. Such burns may lead to distal ischemia and compartment syndrome.","answers":[{"option":"Monitoring of peripheral pulses and capillary filling","explanation":"Regular monitoring of peripheral pulses and capillary filling is indicated in this patient because of her risk for distal ischemia. Her circumferential burn may impair blood flow to the limb secondary to a loss of skin elasticity (due to a developing eschar) or result in compartment syndrome (caused by an accumulation of fluids) during the healing process.","bool":true},{"option":"Soft-tissue ultrasound","explanation":"A soft-tissue ultrasound is indicated for the evaluation of lymph nodes and conditions, such as cellulitis and abscess, but it is not useful for the diagnosis of compartment syndrome.","bool":false},{"option":"Intravenous ampicillin therapy","explanation":"\nAmpicillin (or any other systemic antibiotic) is currently not recommended for prophylaxis of infections in burn patients because of a lack of supporting evidence. Although systemic antibiotics have a role in the treatment of burn wound infections, the patient was brought in just after the burn occurred; a potential infection would not have had time to develop yet.","bool":false},{"option":"X-ray of the chest","explanation":"Severely burned patients are at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) because the extensive tissue damage may lead to a massive release of inflammatory mediators. A chest x-ray is therefore indicated in burn patients who present with symptoms of ARDS (e.g., dyspnea, tachypnea, low oxygen saturation, cyanosis). However, this is not the case for this patient, who is hemodynamically stable and breathing normally.","bool":false},{"option":"Serial arterial blood gas analysis","explanation":"Serial arterial blood gas analysis is indicated in burn patients if inhalation injury is suspected.

If perfusion is not restored in a timely manner, compartment syndrome and acute limb ischemia may result.","bool":true},{"option":"Perform fasciotomy","explanation":"\nFasciotomy is the treatment of choice for acute compartment syndrome (ACS). While this woman shows signs of compromised distal perfusion (reduced capillary refill, pallor, and peripheral O2 saturation of 84%) that could also be due to developing ACS, the vascular compromise is more likely caused by the circumferential eschar itself. Furthermore, ACS is generally associated with severe pain, often out of proportion to the extent of the injury. This patient only has minimal pain in her right arm, resulting from the third-degree burn that has destroyed the cutaneous nerves. Sensation of the deeper layers, including the muscle compartments, however, should still be intact.","bool":false},{"option":"Obtain split-thickness skin graft","explanation":"A split-thickness skin graft is a definitive treatment option for third-degree burns, such as the wound on this patient's right arm. However, definitive management is only considered after all immediate measures have been carried out. This patient presents acutely with signs of vascular compromise, as indicated by the reduced capillary refill; blood flow needs to be restored as soon as possible to prevent compartment syndrome and acute limb ischemia.","bool":false},{"option":"Decrease rate of IV fluids","explanation":"This patient has extensive burns on her arm, leg, and torso. Adequate fluid resuscitation is an important part of the immediate measures for severe burn wounds to counter the fluid loss/shift and to prevent dehydration and associated complications such as acute kidney injury and shock. The circumferential edema that results from the burn eschar and causes compromised perfusion of her arm is likely exacerbated by fluid replacement, but decreasing the rate of IV fluids is not the appropriate therapeutic measure to resolve the vascular compromise.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform right upper extremity amputation","explanation":"\nAmputation of the extremity may be indicated in patients with severe fourth-degree burns. It is also the last resort in patients with acute compartment syndrome and/or acute limb ischemia who present very late (3–5 days) after onset with a nonviable limb.

The beneficial effect of this drug is best explained by inhibition of which of the following processes?","difficulty":5,"hint":"This patient's rash is consistent with atopic dermatitis (eczema). Pimecrolimus, which can be used to treat atopic dermatitis, is a calcineurin inhibitor.","answers":[{"option":"Dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues","explanation":"\nCalcineurin is a phosphatase that activates the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) by dephosphorylating its serine and threonine residues. Activation of NFAT induces the transcription of IL-2, which, in turn, activates NK cells and T cells. Immunosuppressants such as pimecrolimus, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine inhibit calcineurin and thereby prevent dephosphorylation of serine and threonine on NFAT.","bool":true},{"option":"Oxidation of inosine-5-monophosphate","explanation":"Oxidation of inosine-5-monophosphate by the inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is required for guanine synthesis.

Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?","difficulty":3,"hint":"Given this patient's age and history of atrial fibrillation despite cardioversion, her physician most likely added warfarin to her regimen as anticoagulation therapy.","answers":[{"option":"Deficiency of a natural anticoagulant","explanation":"\nDeficiency of protein C, a natural anticoagulant, is a strong predisposing factor for warfarin-induced skin necrosis, which manifests with painful purpura, hemorrhagic blisters, and large areas of necrosis that typically affect subcutaneous adipose tissue of the extremities, trunk, penis, or breasts. Protein C is a protease that inactivates factor V and factor VIII. Although the anticoagulation effect of warfarin is the result of the inhibition of vitamin K-dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X, warfarin also inhibits the anticoagulants protein C and protein S. The half-life of protein C and protein S are relatively shorter than the procoagulants; therefore, a transient state of hypercoagulability occurs during the first days of treatment. The depletion of protein C is more apparent in patients who have a hereditary protein C deficiency, resulting in an increased risk of thrombosis and subsequent tissue infarction in these individuals.\nTo prevent a transient prothrombotic state, patients should be treated with a second anticoagulant (e.g., enoxaparin) for the first few days of warfarin administration.","bool":true},{"option":"Major neurocognitive disorder","explanation":"A major neurocognitive disorder is a known risk factor for accidental medication overdose. In the case of warfarin, an accidental overdose would manifest with signs of dose-dependent bleeding that range from ecchymoses, gingival bleeding, and vaginal bleeding to life-threatening gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding. Hemorrhagic skin necrosis is not associated with warfarin overdose.","bool":false},{"option":"Formation of antibodies against a platelet antigen","explanation":"Formation of antibodies against a platelet agent is the mechanism of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type 2 (HIT II). Administration of heparin (or, less commonly, low molecular weight heparin) can induce the formation of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), causing platelet aggregation and thrombosis. Although HIT II can manifest with hemorrhagic skin necrosis as a result of tissue infarction, thrombocytopenia would be expected. Moreover, symptoms typically develop 5–14 days after heparin therapy is initiated.","bool":false},{"option":"Mutation in clotting factor V","explanation":"A mutation in clotting factor V is the underlying pathomechanism of factor V Leiden. This mutation renders factor V resistant to inactivation by protein C and results in a hypercoagulable state with an increased risk of thromboembolism. Classically, these patients have a history of repeated or early-onset venous thrombotic events. Although hemorrhagic skin necrosis has been reported in patients with the factor V Leiden mutation, it is extremely rare. The recent administration of an anticoagulant should raise suspicion for a different etiology.","bool":false},{"option":"Damaged aortic valve","explanation":"A damaged aortic valve can predispose patients to the development of bacterial endocarditis, which can be complicated by septic thromboembolism. Septic thromboemboli can cause petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, or Osler nodes, but hemorrhagic skin lesions, would not be expected. Furthermore, this patient does not have a new-onset murmur, fever, or risk factors for endocarditis (e.g., recent dental procedure). A damaged valve is not a risk factor for warfarin-related skin necrosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated serum blood glucose","explanation":"Elevated serum blood glucose, as seen in diabetes mellitus, is a predisposing factor for skin infections such as cellulitis, cutaneous candidiasis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Although these lesions can appear similar to the lesions seen in this patient, they are not well-circumscribed. Additionally, other evidence of infection, such as fever, would be expected.

A photograph of the rash is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's skin findings?","difficulty":5,"hint":"The photograph shows well-circumscribed papules on an erythematous base (wheals), which are characteristic of urticaria.","answers":[{"option":"Hyperpermeability of the superficial dermal microvasculature","explanation":"\nBeta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone) can cause acute urticaria by triggering IgE-mediated mast cell activation (type 1 hypersensitivity reaction). Mast cells release histamine and other vasodilatory and inflammatory mediators, which increase blood vessel permeability. Increased microvascular permeability in the superficial dermis is responsible for the formation of wheals. Increased permeability of blood vessels in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue is responsible for angioedema.","bool":true},{"option":"IgE-independent mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissue","explanation":"This patient's skin findings are caused by mast cell activation but are most likely the result of an IgE-mediated process that occurs in the superficial dermis. IgE-independent (direct) mast cell activation is caused by drugs such as opioids and vancomycin.

It is one of the most commonly implicated triggers of SJS. Most cases of SJS develop within 2–8 weeks of initiating the offending medication. The risk of developing SJS induced by lamotrigine therapy is greatest when high doses are used, so the initial dose should be low and increased slowly. In addition, about 10% of patients treated with lamotrigine develop a benign skin rash that is difficult to differentiate from early SJS; accordingly, all patients should be advised to discontinue lamotrigine therapy at the first sign of a rash. Certain antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and carbamazepine can also cause SJS but are less frequently implicated than lamotrigine. Other commonly implicated triggers of SJS include certain sulfa drugs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine), certain antiretroviral drugs (e.g., nevirapine), oxicam NSAIDs (e.g., piroxicam), and allopurinol.","bool":true},{"option":"Atorvastatin","explanation":"Adverse effects of statins (e.g., atorvastatin) include headaches, gastrointestinal symptoms, elevated LFTs, myalgias, and statin-associated myopathy.

This patient has started to use a high-potency topical corticosteroid for a relapse of plaque psoriasis.","answers":[{"option":"Dermal collagen loss","explanation":"\nChronic use of topical corticosteroids causes dermal collagen loss, which manifests as skin atrophy (skin thinning) and stretch marks. Skin thinning is the most common side effect of topical corticosteroid use and often causes the skin to appear translucent, making any underlying vasculature more visible. Longer duration of use, treatment with higher-strength corticosteroids (e.g., clobetasol), and use under occlusion increase the risk of adverse effects. Patients should receive directions on when to stop topical corticosteroid therapy to prevent this adverse effect.\nCorticosteroids bind to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, forming a complex that translocates into the nucleus, where it interacts with specific DNA sequences. The complex activates IκB, which inhibits the function of NF-κB, a transcription factor that normally promotes expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. It also inhibits production of arachidonic acid derivatives by inhibiting phospholipase A2.","bool":true},{"option":"Dysplastic nevi","explanation":"Chronic, systemic corticosteroid use is associated with increased risk of developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma but not dysplastic nevi or melanoma.

Patients infected with B. henselae usually have a history of contact with cats because the pathogen is typically transmitted from the feces of cat fleas via a cat scratch. Immunocompetent individuals remain asymptomatic or develop only a self-limiting infection with fever and granulomatous regional lymphadenopathy (cat scratch disease). Immunocompromised patients, however, can develop BA as a result of hematogenous dissemination.\nBA can also be caused by Bartonella quintana, which is mainly transmitted by body lice (common in homeless populations).

In severe cases, toxins and bacteria released into the blood system may cause fever in addition to the typical skin findings. Predisposing factors for BI include warm and humid climates, unsanitary living conditions, poor personal hygiene, disruption of the skin barrier (e.g., due to trauma or diseases such as scabies or atopic dermatitis), and immunodeficiency (e.g., due to HIV infection). First-line treatment options include oral antibiotic treatment with first-generation cephalosporins (e.g, cephalexin) and dicloxacillin.

Older adults, especially those with dementia, are at increased risk for abuse. Older adult abuse is most commonly perpetrated by caregivers (e.g., spouse, nursing home staff) and can be physical, psychological, or financial, or take the form of neglect. Physicians are legally and ethically obligated to report suspected abuse. When a physician suspects abuse, they should privately speak with the affected patient, ask for further information, and offer assistance.\nFinally, this patient's decreased MCV and hemoglobin are consistent with microcytic anemia (e.g., due to insufficient iron intake) but do not indicate an increased bleeding risk.","bool":true},{"option":"Platelet aggregation inhibition","explanation":"\nBruising due to platelet aggregation inhibition can be seen in patients on antiplatelet agents, and most commonly occurs in women &gt; 60 years old who have recently started antiplatelet therapy (duration &lt; 1 month).

Irritants can be chemical (e.g., water, detergents, solvents) and/or physical (e.g., wood, dust, fiberglass); this patient's occupation (hairdressing) increases his risk of developing ICD due to frequent exposure to chemical irritants (e.g., water, shampoos, permanent wave solutions). The manifestations of ICD are typically limited to the area of exposure. This patient's mild pruritus, erythema, scaling, xerosis, and fissuring are characteristic of chronic ICD, which is more common with exposure to weak irritants (e.g., water, soaps, shampoos). Treatment includes avoidance of irritants, moisturizers to restore the epidermal skin barrier, and symptomatic treatment with topical corticosteroids.\nICD is caused by a direct cytotoxic effect and is not immune-mediated, as opposed to allergic contact dermatitis, which is a T-cell mediated type IV hypersensitivity reaction. To differentiate ICD from allergic contact dermatitis, a patch test for relevant allergens should be performed.","bool":true},{"option":"Seborrheic dermatitis","explanation":"\nSeborrheic dermatitis can manifest with a pruritic, scaly, erythematous rash.

HS is a chronic inflammatory condition thought to be caused by blockage of the folliculopilosebaceous unit. The highest incidence of HS is seen in young women. Risk factors such as smoking, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, and a family history of HS are associated with a more severe disease course. Initial treatment consists of general skincare measures (e.g., gentle skin cleansing, wound care), behavioral interventions (e.g., weight loss, smoking cessation), and topical and/or oral antibiotics.

B. anthracis is endemic in agricultural regions around the world, including central and southwest Asia. The incubation period is typically 5–7 days, after which individuals usually develop a painless, pruritic lesion that ulcerates and becomes a necrotic, black eschar. Local/regional lymphadenopathy, as seen here, is also common. In addition, some patients with cutaneous anthrax develop systemic symptoms, including fever, headache, and myalgias.\nIn patients with cutaneous anthrax without systemic symptoms, oral monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin) or doxycycline is usually sufficient; the presence of systemic symptoms, as seen here, warrants intravenous antibiotic therapy with a fluoroquinolone plus linezolid or clindamycin, and antitoxin therapy (e.g., with raxibacumab or anthrax immunoglobulin).","bool":true},{"option":"Ulceroglandular tularemia","explanation":"\nUlceroglandular tularemia typically manifests with fever, skin ulcer, and regional lymphadenopathy, similar to what is seen in this patient.

Affected individuals typically present with pruritus, rectal pain during defecation, and blood-streaked stools. Signs of systemic infection (e.g., fever, abnormal vitals) are usually absent because of the superficial nature of the infection. A history of intrafamilial spread of perianal dermatitis or of close contact with people with streptococcal infection (e.g., pharyngitis) is common. The diagnosis is primarily clinical but can be confirmed with bacterial culture. While penicillin is an effective agent against GAS, amoxicillin is often preferred for pediatric patients because it can be administered as an oral emulsion.

Drugs that are known to cause phototoxic drug reactions include tetracyclines (such as demeclocycline), sulfonamides, thiazides, and fluoroquinolones. Phototoxic reactions typically manifest as a rash on sun-exposed skin that resembles a severe sunburn and may include vesicles or blisters in severe cases. Unlike photoallergic drug reactions, phototoxic drug reactions occur without prior sensitization to the triggering agent and occur within minutes to hours of sun exposure.","bool":true},{"option":"Formation of drug-induced autoantibodies","explanation":"Drug-induced lupus erythematosus is a syndrome that may clinically resemble cutaneous or systemic lupus erythematosus and is characterized by autoantibody formation in response to exposure to a drug.

A positive test shows hyphae and spores resembling spaghetti and meatballs on microscopy. Pityriasis versicolor is most commonly caused by the fungi Malassezia globosa and Malassezia furfur. Skin lesions typically manifest as hyperpigmented or hypopigmented macules or patches. Individuals with light skin, such as this patient, often become aware of the disease after sun exposure because the lesions do not tan and become more visible against the surrounding skin.","bool":true},{"option":"Punch biopsy","explanation":"\nPunch biopsy is an important test in cases of suspected skin infection or malignancy. While infection with Mycobacterium leprae may also manifest with hypopigmented patches on the shoulders, other symptoms of leprosy such as loss of sensation, muscle weakness, poor eyesight, and painless lumps on the face or earlobes would also be expected. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma as well may manifest with hypopigmented patches, but this variant predominates in children rather than in a 21-year old man. Classic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma presents with red, scaly, pruritic, well-demarcated skin plaques and patches, mushroom-shaped tumors, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly in the later stages of the disease. Histopathological evaluation would show atypical CD4+ T-cells in the dermis and epidermis and Pautrier microabscesses.

Vitiligo commonly presents with hypopigmented lesions on the extremities that do not have a scaly appearance, as seen in this patient. While guttate psoriasis can present with hypopigmentation, pinkish papules with a fine scale are more common and they tend to occur over a period of 2–3 months rather than 5 days, as seen in the patient here. Corticosteroids are therefore not only not indicated, they would actually worsen the fungal infection with their immunosuppressive effect.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral fluconazole","explanation":"\nFluconazole is used for infections with Candida, Cryptococcus, and dermatophytes, including tinea versicolor. However, fluconazole has many systemic side effects like hepatotoxicity, seizures, and gastrointestinal distress.

The diagnosis is confirmed if a biopsy of the affected tissue shows vascular proliferation and neutrophilic infiltrate and positivity on Warthin-Starry staining. Treatment is antibiotic therapy (erythromycin or doxycycline).","bool":true},{"option":"HHV-8 virus","explanation":"\nHHV-8 virus infection causes Kaposi sarcoma (KS), an AIDS-defining condition that manifests with solitary or multiple bluish-brown, painless plaques or nodules. With disease progression, KS may disseminate to other organs (e.g., the liver). However, in addition to vascular proliferation, biopsy findings would also show spindle-shaped cells. Moreover, a biopsy sample in a patient with KS typically shows abundant lymphocytes, not neutrophils.","bool":false},{"option":"Mycobacterium avium","explanation":"Infection with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), an AIDS-defining condition, is the most common opportunistic bacterial infection in patients with AIDS. However, MAC typically causes systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy) and very rarely manifests in patients with a CD4+ count &gt; 50/mm3.","bool":false},{"option":"Cryptosporidium parvum","explanation":"\nCryptosporidiosis is an AIDS-defining condition that manifests with chronic, watery diarrhea as well as nausea and abdominal pain. Liver involvement (e.g., hepatitis) does occur in some cases, but cutaneous lesions are not characteristic of this condition.","bool":false},{"option":"Candida albicans","explanation":"Localized Candida infection causes several conditions, including oral thrush, skin infections, Candida esophagitis (an AIDS-defining condition), and invasive disease (systemic candidiasis). Systemic infection can occasionally involve the liver. However, vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils would not be expected on biopsy.","bool":false},{"option":"Treponema pallidum","explanation":"\nTreponema pallidum infection causes syphilis. Patients with secondary syphilis may present with nodular lesions and skin biopsy of these lesions. However, vascular proliferation is not a typical histopathological finding and the patient has tested negative for rapid plasma reagin (RPR), which together make syphilis an unlikely diagnosis.","bool":false}]},{"id":71,"info":"Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue","question":"A 15-month-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of low-grade fever and a painful lesion on her right index finger. She was born at term and has been healthy except for a vesicular rash on her upper lip 2 weeks ago, which resolved without treatment. She lives at home with her parents, her 5-year-old brother, and two cats. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. A photograph of the right index finger is shown. Physical examination shows tender right epitrochlear lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?","difficulty":2,"hint":"A Tzanck smear of the vesicular base will show multinucleated giant cells.","answers":[{"option":"Herpes simplex virus type 1","explanation":"\nHerpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of herpetic whitlow, an infection of the dermal and subcutaneous tissue of the fingers (especially the thumb and index fingers). It is transmitted through direct contact between a break in the skin on the finger and infected secretions, often from primary oral lesions (e.g., labial herpes), as suggested in this patient. Children who suck their fingers and health care workers (especially dentists) are most commonly affected. The condition presents with painful, grouped, nonpurulent vesicles, usually accompanied by tingling, and burning sensations in the affected digits. Axillary and epitrochlear lymphadenopathy may also develop.","bool":true},{"option":"Staphylococcus aureus","explanation":"\nStaphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of acute paronychia, a painful soft tissue infection affecting the skin around the nails of fingers and toes. Paronychia is typically purulent, unlike the skin lesion seen in this child, which suggests a nonbacterial etiology.","bool":false},{"option":"Trichophyton rubrum","explanation":"\nTrichophyton rubrum can cause superficial fungal skin infections in almost any area of the body, including the hands (tinea manuum) and nails (tinea unguium, onychomycosis). Tinea unguium presents with yellowish-gray nail discoloration and progressive destruction of the nail plate, resulting in brittle, crumbly nails, and possibly long-term nail dystrophies. The periungual soft tissue is usually not affected but may show signs of inflammation (erythema, swelling). Tinea manuum may occur secondary to tinea unguium and presents with fine scaling of the palms and/or lesions similar to tinea corporis on the back of the hand. Since this patient shows no signs of nail involvement and only the one finger is affected, a fungal infection can be ruled out.","bool":false},{"option":"Bartonella henselae","explanation":"\nBartonella henselae is a bacteria that causes cat scratch disease, which is typically transmitted by cats through scratching, biting, or licking. Initially, one or more painless vesicles form at the site of inoculation and evolve into papules. After one to three weeks, tender lymphadenopathy develops in lymph nodes that drain the inoculation site. Systemic symptoms, including malaise and fever, commonly occur. Although this patient is at risk of contracting cat scratch disease given her exposure to the family's cats, her lesion is painful and lymphadenopathy developed rapidly, which make this diagnosis unlikely. Multiple grouped, nonpurulent vesicles are more suggestive of a different causal organism.","bool":false},{"option":"Human papillomavirus type 1","explanation":"\nHuman papillomavirus type 1 (HPV type 1) is a common cause of verruca vulgaris, also known as common warts. These typically present on the hands and feet as scaly papules, and are usually painless, though they may be pruritic. Since systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy do not occur in verruca vulgaris, an infection with HPV type 1 can be ruled out.","bool":false},{"option":"Group A Streptococcus","explanation":"\nGroup A Streptococcus (GAS) causes nonbullous impetigo, which can manifest with small vesicles surrounded by erythema and regional lymphadenopathy. However, this patient's history of a vesicular rash on the upper lip two weeks ago and the presence of systemic symptoms (i.e., fever) make a different condition more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Sporothrix schenckii","explanation":"\nSporothrix schenckii causes sporotrichosis, a fungal infection typically acquired through gardening. The fungus is found in soil and on plants and enters the skin through small lesions (e.g., a thorn prick). A painless, erythematous, or violaceous plaque develops at the site of inoculation, which is followed by new lesions appearing along the lymphatic tract after a few weeks. Systemic symptoms do not typically occur. The patient's development of painful, multiple vesicles with simultaneous onset of lymphadenopathy and fever rules out S. schenckii.","bool":false},{"option":"Molluscum contagiosum virus","explanation":"\nMolluscum contagiosum virus causes localized skin infection and is transmitted through direct skin contact with an infected individual. The lesions are usually painless, flesh-colored, and characteristically dome-shaped with a central umbilication. Typical predilection sites in children are the face, trunk, and extremities.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s skin condition?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Open comedones and inflammatory papules and pustules in an adolescent patient are characteristic of acne vulgaris, an extremely common disorder of pilosebaceous follicles.","answers":[{"option":"Increased levels of androgen","explanation":"\nIncreased levels of androgen, as present during puberty, stimulate sebum production, which can lead to the obstruction of pilosebaceous units within the epidermis. This obstruction results in clogged pores, or comedones, which are characteristic of acne vulgaris. In response to excessive sebum secretion, Cutibacterium acnes can proliferate within the pilosebaceous unit and induce an inflammatory reaction with the formation of papules, nodules, pustules, and/or cysts.","bool":true},{"option":"Type IV hypersensitivity reaction","explanation":"A type IV hypersensitivity reaction is the mechanism underlying allergic contact dermatitis, which occurs in susceptible individuals after repeat skin exposure to an allergen. Lesions in allergic contact dermatitis are intensely pruritic, erythematous, and papular, although they can also be vesicular in nature. The distribution and characterization of the lesions in this patient are not consistent with allergic contact dermatitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Dysfunction of apocrine glands","explanation":"Dysfunction of apocrine glands is believed to contribute to hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), an inflammatory skin disorder affecting areas with abundant apocrine sweat glands including the axilla, groin, and perineum. Lesions in HS can form abscesses, fistulas, and draining sinuses with foul odor. This patient exhibits none of these clinical features.","bool":false},{"option":"Formation of superficial epidermal inclusion cyst","explanation":"Formation of superficial epidermal inclusion cysts is the underlying mechanism of milia. Milia is a benign skin disorder typically affecting neonates, marked by small white papules on the nose and cheeks that resolve spontaneously. The inflammatory, comedonal nature of this patient's skin lesions and distribution on the face, back, and chest are inconsistent with milia.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperplasia of pilosebaceous glands","explanation":"\nHyperplasia of pilosebaceous glands occurs in the phymatous subtype of rosacea. Rosacea typically affects individuals 30–60 years old, and the phymatous subtype causes disfiguring enlargement of the nose, known as rhinophyma. This patient has comedonal lesions, which are not expected in rosacea, and he does not have rhinophyma or other symptoms of rosacea.","bool":false},{"option":"Hyperkeratinization of hair follicles","explanation":"Hyperkeratinization of hair follicles is the underlying mechanism of keratosis pilaris, which results in rough bumps distributed over the extensor surfaces of the arms and thighs.

While children are at high risk for tinea infections, however, the distribution pattern of this patient's lesions is much more characteristic of another skin condition. In addition, dermatophyte infections affecting the hair or nails (e.g., tinea capitis or onychomycosis) generally require oral (e.g., terbinafine, griseofulvin), rather than topical, antifungals.","bool":false},{"option":"Tar-containing shampoo","explanation":"Tar-containing shampoo is indicated in patients with infantile seborrheic dermatitis, which may also manifest with scaling plaques on the face. However, these plaques are usually greasy, yellow, nonpruritic, spare the trunk and extremities, and appear within the first 3 months of life. Observation is usually sufficient, but the use of tar-containing shampoo and emollients can help relieve symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Topical mupirocin","explanation":"Topical mupirocin is indicated in nonbullous impetigo, which manifests with honey-colored, crusted lesions with surrounding erythema, typically on the face. The infection can be primary or secondary due to scratching and subsequent superinfection (impetiginization). This patient's rash lacks crusting, which makes impetigo unlikely. Moreover, impetigo is not usually pruritic.","bool":false},{"option":"Topical coal tar","explanation":"\nCoal tar is sometimes used in psoriasis, which can also manifest with a pruritic rash. However, the skin lesions in psoriasis are typically clearly demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scaling. Further manifestations such as nail changes (e.g., pitting or discoloration) or arthritis are also missing in this patient. Moreover, psoriasis in infancy is uncommon. Lastly, psoriasis has a strong genetic component, and this patient lacks a family history of psoriasis.","bool":false},{"option":"Topical emollient","explanation":"\nTopical skin moisturizers (emollients) are the first-line treatment for all patients with atopic dermatitis, which classically manifests with dry, poorly-demarcated white scaling and erythema. In patients &lt; 2 years of age, the face and extensor surfaces of the extremities are typically affected and the diaper area is spared. Older children and adults tend to have the flexural pattern of eczema, commonly affecting the elbow and knee creases. The rash is usually severely pruritic, which may cause sleeping problems. Up to 15% of children are affected and are typically 4 months old at presentation. A personal or family history of atopy, as seen in this family, is very common. The main complication of atopic dermatitis is the development of secondary infections such as impetigo, HSV infection, warts, and/or dermatophytes. Important differential diagnoses of infantile atopic dermatitis are seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis.","bool":true},{"option":"Oral vitamin A","explanation":"\nVitamin A is indicated in all patients with measles, which may also manifest with a generalized rash. However, the measles rash is not dry, scaly, or pruritic. It also has a different distribution pattern and is usually preceded by high fever and cough. While this patient has not yet received the MMR vaccine because of his young age, an exanthem due to measles does not persist for 2 weeks, but instead, usually fades after ∼ 5 days. While there is no cure for measles, vitamin A should be administered to help prevent complications such as otitis media, viral pneumonia, encephalitis, corneal ulceration, and/or subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral acyclovir","explanation":"\nAcyclovir is indicated in eczema herpeticum, a viral cutaneous infection, most commonly caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 and often associated with preexisting skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis.

Molluscum contagiosum is a condition that typically affects children, but adult patients with immunosuppression (e.g., due to HIV infection, chemotherapy, or extensive corticosteroid therapy) are also at risk of infection. Cryotherapy is the first-line treatment for adults. In this patient, the regimen and dosage of antiretroviral therapy should also be optimized because of his low CD4 count (&lt; 350 cells/mm3).","bool":true},{"option":"Papillomavirus","explanation":"\nHuman papillomaviruses cause common warts, which take the form of papules with a cauliflower-like surface. Molluscum contagiosum is not caused by papillomaviruses.","bool":false},{"option":"Coccidioides","explanation":"\nCoccidioides immitis causes coccidioidomycosis (valley fever), which often has nonspecific findings such as fever, cough, and fatigue but can also cause erythema nodosum.

Desmoglein-1 is a desmosomal protein located in the granular layer of the epidermis and responsible for attaching the keratinocytes to one another. Loss of the cell-to-cell attachments results in intraepidermal fissure formation, which presents as fragile, flaccid blisters. Bullous impetigo is also caused by staphylococcal exfoliative toxins but remains localized, in contrast to SSSS.\nTreatment of SSSS consists of IV antibiotics and supportive care. Although most patients respond well to conventional therapy, SSSS is a potentially fatal condition with an increased mortality rate in adults.","bool":true},{"option":"Autoantibody binding of hemidesmosomes","explanation":"\nAutoantibodies directed against hemidesmosomal proteins of the epithelial basement membrane can be found in bullous pemphigoid. Although the absence of mucosal lesions supports this diagnosis, bullous pemphigoid is more common in elderly patients and the blisters are usually large and tense, not flaccid. Also, Nikolsky sign would be negative (unlike in this patient), as the lesions are located subepidermally.","bool":false},{"option":"Autoantibody deposition in stratum spinosum","explanation":"\nAutoantibodies against desmosomal adhesion proteins in the stratum spinosum are a diagnostic finding in pemphigus vulgaris. Damage to these proteins causes intraepidermal bullae formation, a positive Nikolsky sign, and flaccid blisters over the face and trunk. However, affected patients are usually &gt; 30 years of age and mucosal involvement is very common (often precedes cutaneous manifestations).","bool":false},{"option":"Bacterial invasion of the epidermis","explanation":"In children, bacterial invasion of the skin is most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus infection and manifests as impetigo. A clinical presentation similar to this patients can be seen in the less common bullous variant of impetigo, which is caused by staphylococcal extoxins that destroy keratinocyte adhesions.

However, the blisters are localized, not diffuse, and on a nonerythematous base.","bool":false},{"option":"Cytotoxic T-cell release of granulysin","explanation":"Cytotoxic T-cell release of granulysin with resulting damage to the keratinocytes is the pathophysiologic mechanism of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (or toxic epidermal necrolysis). Patients also present with fever, a blistering rash, and a positive Nikolsky sign. However, mucosal involvement is almost always present. Furthermore, SJS is usually caused by a delayed immune-mediated reaction to drugs. Since there is no mention of a newly initiated medication, another diagnosis is more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Bacterial production of erythrogenic toxin","explanation":"Strains of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) that produce erythrogenic exotoxin A are the causative agent of scarlet fever, which presents with an erythematous, sandpaper-like rash. It is not a blistering disorder and resolution of the exanthem takes place by desquamation instead of vesicle/bullae formation. Moreover, patients with scarlet fever usually have flushed cheeks with perioral pallor, palatal petechiae, and a white-coated or strawberry-red tongue.

Severe burns, as seen in this patient, lead to a hypermetabolic state, which provides energy to the cells involved in wound healing and counters the significant heat and water loss that results from the loss of insulating cutaneous tissue. This postburn hypermetabolic response is characterized by two distinct phases. During the first phase (called the “Ebb phase,” up to 48 hours postburn), cardiac output and metabolism are decreased. The second phase (called the “flow phase”) is characterized by an increase in stress-induced hormones (e.g., catecholamines, glucocorticoids) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α), which lead to a gradual increase in metabolism, cardiac output, and body temperature until reaching a plateau (around one week postburn). Consequences of the hypermetabolic response include hyperglycemia, peripheral insulin resistance, increased muscle protein degradation, increased lipolysis, and significant weight loss.\nPostburn hypermetabolism can last up to 2–3 years and is associated with poor long-term results (e.g., immune dysfunction and infections, delayed wound healing).

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This patient's symptoms are concerning for an adverse effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI).","answers":[{"option":"Impaired breakdown of kinins","explanation":"\nACE is one of the enzymes responsible for the degradation of kinins. Therapy with ACEIs can therefore result in increased bradykinin serum levels, which in turn can cause angioedema due to vasodilation and increase in vascular permeability. It can also cause dry cough. Severe edema of the tongue and/or larynx can obstruct the upper airway resulting in difficulty swallowing, speaking, and/or stridor. Although these adverse effects typically occur soon after initiation of treatment, they may occur at any time, even years after starting treatment.

The use of ACE inhibitors can trigger angioedema in patients with HAE. However, in HAE the onset of symptoms usually occurs during childhood or adolescence and C4 levels would typically be decreased.","bool":false},{"option":"Scombroid poisoning","explanation":"\nScombroid food poisoning results from eating histidine-rich fish that has spoiled. After ingestion, the release of histamine results in symptoms that mimic an allergic reaction (e.g. flushing, urticaria, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps) that typically occur within 20–30 minutes after ingestion and may progress to angioedema and symptoms of anaphylaxis.

The hair either enters the interfollicular epidermis after exiting the follicular orifice (extrafollicular penetration) or penetrates the dermis before exiting the follicular orifice (transfollicular penetration). The resulting inflammatory reaction against the hair leads to the characteristic finding of painful papules distributed along the areas of facial hair growth. Management of pseudofolliculitis barbae includes cessation of shaving and adjunctive topical therapies (e.g., topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and antimicrobial therapy to treat secondary infection).","bool":true},{"option":"Bacterial infection of the superficial or deep hair follicle","explanation":"Bacterial folliculitis is characterized predominantly by pustules and erythematous papules on hair-growing areas of the skin, not by the firm, dark papules as seen in this case.","bool":false},{"option":"Cutibacterium acnes colonization of the pilosebaceous unit","explanation":"\nCutibacterium acnes colonization of the pilosebaceous unit causes acne vulgaris, which manifests primarily on the face with inflammatory papules, pustules, nodules, and comedones.

The virulence factor responsible for the edema seen in this patient has a mechanism of action similar to which of the following enzymes?","difficulty":3,"hint":"This woman has cutaneous anthrax, which typically manifests after a 5–7 day incubation period as a small papule that rapidly progresses to a painless, black eschar with extensive surrounding edema and regional lymphadenopathy. The edema is caused by edema factor produced by Bacillus anthracis.","answers":[{"option":"Adenylate cyclase","explanation":"\nEdema factor (EF) produced by B. anthracis performs the same function as adenylate cyclase. After undergoing endocytosis, the EF causes a pathological increase in cAMP, which in turn drastically increases water influx into cells. This results in cellular lysis.","bool":true},{"option":"Guanylate cyclase","explanation":"\nGuanylate cyclase is pathologically activated by heat-stable toxin from enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). The typical presentation would be profuse, watery diarrhea after distant travel (“traveler's diarrhea”).","bool":false},{"option":"SNARE protein","explanation":"\nSNARE protein function is interrupted by toxins released from Clostridium species, specifically C. tetani and C. botulinum. C. tetani produces the toxin tetanospasmin, which clinically produces spastic paralysis (as seen in tetanus). C. botulinum produces botulinum toxin, which leads to a characteristic flaccid paralysis (as seen in botulism).","bool":false},{"option":"Lecithinase","explanation":"\nLecithinase is the alpha toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens. It acts as a phospholipase and severely damages cellular membranes, resulting in necrotizing fasciitis and other rapidly progressive skin and soft tissue infections.

A black eschar would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Catalase","explanation":"\nCatalase is produced by several species, including Nocardia, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococci. The enzyme degrades hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water and oxygen, thereby preventing hydrogen peroxide from being used as a substrate for myeloperoxidase and the subsequent production of toxic reactive oxygen species. Although B. anthracis does produce catalase, it is not thought to play a meaningful role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous anthrax.","bool":false},{"option":"IgA protease","explanation":"\nIgA protease is an important virulence factor for pathogens that typically infect mucosa-lined structures such as the urogenital and respiratory tracts (e.g., S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type b, and Neisseria).

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's skin findings?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The photograph shows well-demarcated plaques with silvery scaling. The morphology of the lesion, bleeding when superficial scales are removed (Auspitz sign), symmetrical involvement of both limbs, location of the lesion on the extensor surface, and the propensity of the lesion to occur on regions of microtrauma such as the elbows (Koebner phenomenon) indicate psoriasis. Both HIV infection and smoking are risk factors for psoriasis. Psoriatic lesions can be itchy because of local inflammation and/or skin irritation by psoriatic skin flakes.","answers":[{"option":"Increased keratinocyte proliferation","explanation":"In psoriatic lesions, basal keratinocytes hyperproliferate and rapidly progress through all the epidermal layers (over 4–5 days) without undergoing complete differentiation. This typically causes erythematous and/or scaly plaques (plaque psoriasis) to appear. The precise cause of this hyperproliferation is not understood, but a T-cell mediated process and cytokines such as interleukins and TNF-α are suspected to play a role. Other sites for psoriatic lesions include the scalp and back. In addition to skin changes, patients with psoriasis can have dystrophic nail changes (e.g., pitting, brittle nails, onycholysis), and/or arthralgia (psoriatic arthritis). Psoriasis is diagnosed based on clinical examination.\nMild psoriasis can be treated with emollients and topical preparations of steroids, vitamin D derivates (e.g., calcipotriene), coal tar, or retinoids.

Kaposi sarcoma is also associated with immunocompromised states (e.g., HIV infection) and the Koebner phenomenon may also be present. However, the plaques would be violaceous due to the vascular nature of the lesions.","bool":false},{"option":"IgE-mediated hypersensitivity","explanation":"\nIgE-mediated hypersensitivity causes atopic dermatitis, which may result in pruritic skin lesions. However, atopic dermatitis is characterized by acute exacerbations with erythema, crusting, and/or excoriation. Symptom onset is generally during early childhood. The elbows and knees are commonly affected sites in atopic dermatitis, and hyperkeratotic skin may be seen in long-standing cases (due to lichenification). However, lichenified skin is usually hyperpigmented and not well-demarcated, in contrast to the well-demarcated, silvery lesions seen here.","bool":false},{"option":"Neoplastic T-cell Infiltration ","explanation":"Infiltration of neoplastic T cells is seen in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which is associated with immunocompromised states such as HIV infection and manifests with itchy, scaly plaques. However, the plaques would be pink, red, or brown rather than silvery-white, and the lesions are usually located over the chest, back, abdomen, and/or buttocks. Moreover, the course of the disease is slowly progressive and flat lesions would be present for a few years before the onset of plaques. Furthermore, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma primarily occurs in middle-aged and elderly patients.","bool":false},{"option":"Human papillomavirus-2 (HPV-2) infection","explanation":"\nHPV-2 infection causes verruca vulgaris (common wart), which can appear as discrete, raised, scaly lesions on regions of microtrauma such as the dorsal surface of the elbow (pseudo-koebnerization). The incidence of verucca vulgaris is higher in patients with HIV infection. However, these lesions are usually papules (unlike the plaques seen here), are typically not itchy, and do not bleed easily on scratching. Moreover, the surface of these lesions would be made up multiple, tiny, finger-like projections. In patients with severe verruca vulgaris (e.g., immunocompromised patients), many warts can coalesce to form larger plaque-like lesions. In such a scenario, however, multiple satellite lesions would be evident near the larger plaque.","bool":false},{"option":"Exfoliative skin inflammation","explanation":"Exfoliative skin inflammation is seen in erythroderma, which may result in pruritus and scaling. Patients with HIV infection may develop erythroderma as a result of Sezary syndrome or the use of certain NNRTIs. However, erythroderma has a hyperacute course.

Oral LP typically manifests bilaterally and is classified into three clinical subtypes. The most common subtype is reticular, which is characterized by Wickham striae and is usually asymptomatic. Erythematous oral LP manifests with red patches, pain, irritation, and/or burning sensation, whereas erosive oral LP is characterized by erosions and ulcers. Two or more subtypes of oral LP can occur simultaneously, as seen in this patient. While cutaneous LP usually self-resolves after 1–2 years, oral LP has a chronic course; the main goal of treatment is symptom relief and reduction of erosive lesion. Asymptomatic oral LP does not require treatment, but follow-up is necessary every 6–12 months to assess the risk of malignant transformation.","bool":true},{"option":"Oral acyclovir therapy","explanation":"Oral acyclovir therapy is used to treat herpetic gingivostomatitis, which manifests with painful erythematous mucosal ulcerations.

Dermatophyte infections can affect the scalp (tinea capitis), inguinal area (tinea cruris), hands (tinea manuum), feet (tinea pedis), nails (tinea unguium), or rest of the body (tinea corporis). Tinea corporis is most commonly caused by Trichophyton rubrum and classically spreads centrifugally, manifesting with an erythematous, annular, and pruritic plaque with central clearing and a raised border. The diagnosis is confirmed by obtaining scale from a lesion and visualizing branching, septate hyphae on a KOH test. Antifungal treatment options include topical azoles (e.g., ketoconazole) or systemic agents (e.g., oral terbinafine) for extensive and/or refractory disease.","bool":true},{"option":"Psoriasis","explanation":"\nPsoriasis is a chronic condition that causes pruritic, erythematous, well-demarcated plaques.

Therapy with ACE inhibitors can therefore increase bradykinin serum levels, which in turn can cause angioedema due to vasodilation and an increase in vascular permeability. Severe edema of the tongue and/or larynx can obstruct the upper airway, resulting in dyspnea and/or stridor. Increased levels of bradykinin can also cause a dry cough. Although these adverse effects typically occur soon after initiation of treatment, they may occur at any time, even years after starting treatment. Angioedema usually resolves within 2–3 weeks of discontinuing ACE inhibitors. Unlike angioedema caused by mast-cell degranulation, angioedema caused by an increase in bradykinin is not associated with pruritus or urticaria. ACE inhibitors are overall the most common cause of acquired angioedema.","bool":true},{"option":"IgE-mediated histamine release","explanation":"\nIgE-mediated histamine release (type 1 hypersensitivity reaction) can cause angioedema and dyspnea.

Her menstrual cycles occur at regular 28-day intervals. Physical examination shows black-blue discoloration of the skin in the axillae, areolae, and perineum. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A biopsy of the skin obtained from the axilla shows lipofuscin granules within coiled secretory glands in the lower dermis; the secretory ducts of these glands empty into the infundibulum of hair follicles. Which of the following terms best describes the glands seen on this patient's biopsy?","difficulty":3,"hint":"These glands, which are coiled in shape and located in the dermis, are sweat glands.","answers":[{"option":"Apocrine","explanation":"Blue stains on clothes after exercise and black-blue discoloration of the skin suggest chromhidrosis. The location of the discolored skin and the skin biopsy, which shows lipofuscin granules within secretory glands that drain into the infundibulum of hair follicles, reflect the fact that chromhidrosis most commonly affects the apocrine glands. Chromhidrosis is characterized by the production of colored sweat and typically manifests after puberty, when the development of apocrine glands is complete. It is caused by the secretion of lipofuscin granules, with the color of the sweat depending on the grade of oxidation of lipofuscin. Other examples of apocrine glands are the mammary glands, ceruminous glands, and Moll glands.","bool":true},{"option":"Eccrine","explanation":"\nEccrine sweat glands, which can be affected in eccrine chromhidrosis, are present in the dermis and are coiled in shape, which is consistent with this patient's biopsy findings. However, these sweat glands are primarily located on the palms and soles rather than the axillae, perineum, and areolae. Moreover, the secretory ducts of eccrine sweat glands open directly onto the surface of the skin rather than the infundibulum of hair follicles. This patient has a different form of chromhidrosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Holocrine","explanation":"The cells of holocrine glands release content via lysis of the cell itself.

Reduced activity of lysyl oxidase results in the characteristic coarse, brittle, “kinky” hair and inelastic skin seen in Menkes disease. This condition is due to an X-linked recessive mutation in the ATP7A gene, which codes for a protein involved in copper absorption and transport. Because this mutation impairs intestinal absorption of copper, total body copper is low.

Pressure sensation (or protective sensation of the foot) can be tested using the monofilament test, vibration sense is tested using the tuning-fork test, and pain sensation is tested using the pinprick test. Daily self-examination of the feet for evidence of injury or infection is also recommended. These measures help prevent and detect diabetic ulcers.","bool":true},{"option":"Intravenous antibiotic therapy","explanation":"Intravenous antibiotic therapy would be indicated if there was evidence of secondary infection of the ulcer (e.g., fever, local cellulitis, purulent discharge) or osteomyelitis of the bone underlying the ulcer (e.g., purulent discharge, positive probe-to-bone test, abnormalities on the foot x-ray). As this patient currently has no evidence of any of these conditions, intravenous antibiotic therapy is not required.","bool":false},{"option":"Increase frequency of dressing change","explanation":"The frequency of dressing change of a diabetic ulcer depends on the characteristics of the ulcer. A twice- or thrice-daily dressing would benefit an ulcer that is infected or that has a profuse exudate and soaks the dressing. This permits frequent inspection of the wound, removal of dead or infected tissue, prevention of maceration of the surrounding skin, and promotes healing. An ulcer with healthy granulation tissue should be dressed less frequently (once every 2–3 days) to avoid disrupting the healing process. As this patient's ulcer has no evidence of infection, profuse discharge, or granulation tissue, a once-daily dressing, which is already being done, is sufficient. Another intervention to expedite healing is more urgently indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Surgical revascularization of the right foot","explanation":"Surgical revascularization is indicated for the management of arterial ulcers that develop in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Arterial ulcers are typically painful, shallow ulcers with a punched-out edge, and pale granulation tissue on the ulcer floor. These ulcers commonly develop over the toes, malleoli, or the dorsum of the foot, unlike this patient's painless plantar ulcer. In addition, there is no evidence of PAD in this patient, such as claudication pain or absent peripheral pulses. Thus, surgical revascularization is not an appropriate therapy in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Total contact casting of right foot","explanation":"Total contact casting is indicated in the management of neuropathic foot ulcers, as it off-loads the pressure from the wound and facilitates healing.

Facial tinea presents as round or oval, red, scaly lesions that often have a central clearing, not with lesions that are crusted over. Additionally, tinea often causes pruritus, whereas this patient has no such symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Topical mupirocin therapy","explanation":"\nNonbullous impetigo is the most common type of impetigo and manifests with papular and/or pustular lesions with serous oozing that dry and form characteristic honey-colored crusts. Although these lesions typically develop on the face, they may also affect the extremities. Nonbullous impetigo is typically a clinical diagnosis (see “Most common manifestations of impetigo” table). A skin culture may be necessary for patients with persistent, recurrent infection or if the diagnosis is inconclusive. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin and retapamulin are the first-line treatment for mild nonbullous impetigo. In patients with multiple lesions or ecthyma, systemic antibiotics may be required.","bool":true},{"option":"Topical miconazole therapy","explanation":"\nMiconazole is used topically in the treatment of superficial fungal infections such as tinea.

Additionally, tinea often causes pruritus, whereas this patient has no such symptoms.","bool":false},{"option":"Swab for culture","explanation":"Swabs of pus or detritus from the patient's skin lesions can be used for Gram stain and culture. This is only performed if clinical findings are inconclusive or if treatment is ineffective. In the latter case, Gram stain and culture can detect the causative pathogen and its resistance pattern. This is especially relevant in cases of infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which requires more tailored antibiotic therapy with clindamycin.

The absence of bullae in this patient rules out the diagnosis of bullous impetigo. Patients with ecthyma present with heaped-up, dry crusts that are tightly adherent to the skin instead of amber-colored pus-filled crusts. In the case of ecthyma, extremities are also more commonly affected than the face.

The disease typically manifests with mild febrile illness, occasionally followed by a maculopapular rash beginning on the perioral areas of the face several days later and spreading to the extremities from there. As the rash clears, it adopts a lacy and reticular pattern. Parvovirus B19 infection in adults may also manifest with symptoms of symmetric polyarthritis in the fingers, hands, knees, and ankles while the rash can be absent. The disease is usually self-limited and treatment is supportive, involving analgesics and NSAIDs.

The serpentine rash is an inflammatory reaction that follows the migratory path of the hookworm larva penetrating the skin, which causes an initial small red papule, and burrowing through the epidermis. The larva moves primarily through secreted hyaluronidase and protease activity, but the lack of collagenase prevents penetration through the basement membrane. Humans are an accidental intermediate host, and the infection is usually self-limiting and resolves on its own within 2 months. However, it can be treated with oral ivermectin or albendazole to relieve symptoms and prevent secondary bacterial infection.","bool":true},{"option":"Swimmer's itch","explanation":"\nSwimmer's itch is an immune reaction to a water-borne cutaneous infection with Schistosoma. Affected patients develop itchy papules and blisters within hours of infection, which resolve within a week without intervention. This patient has a migratory rash that has lasted at least 3 weeks, making swimmer's itch an unlikely diagnosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Tinea corporis","explanation":"\nTinea corporis manifests with erythematous, scaly plaques that spread centrifugally and develop central clearing.

Although the exact etiology of SSPE is not fully understood, it is thought to result from persistent replication of a defective variant of the measles virus within neurons and glial cells. Particles of this defective virus accumulate intracellularly and are detectable as inclusion bodies on brain tissue analysis. These particles cause inflammation of the parenchyma and ultimately lead to neuronal degeneration, gliosis, and demyelination. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows high levels of anti-measles antibodies.\nMeasles, with all of its other complications (including bacterial superinfection, giant-cell pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and acute encephalomyelitis), can easily be prevented by the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.","bool":true},{"option":"Glomerular immune complex deposition","explanation":"\nGlomerular immune complex deposition occurs in glomerulonephritis, which can develop after a streptococcal infection of the throat (e.g., bacterial pharyngitis, scarlet fever) and the skin (e.g., erysipelas).

Besides having positive effects on acne vulgaris, the progestin contained in COCs opposes estrogen-driven endometrial hyperplasia, which reduces the risk of developing type 1 endometrial cancer. This risk decreases with a longer duration of COC use, and protection persists for many years after drug cessation. COCs also reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer, possibly through reduced cell proliferation within the ovaries and fallopian tubes.","bool":true},{"option":"Cervical cancer","explanation":"Long-term COC use (≥ 5 years) is associated with an increased risk of developing cervical cancer.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of the disease?\n\n\n","difficulty":1,"hint":"This patient has multiple vesicles and crusty lesions with severe burning pain, located in a well-circumscribed area of the body, which probably corresponds to a dermatome. These features are typical of a shingles infection.","answers":[{"option":"Viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia","explanation":"\nViral reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the dorsal root ganglia results in shingles. Initial infection with VZV occurs as chickenpox, after which the virus remains dormant in dorsal root ganglia. In periods of stress or in immunocompromised and vulnerable populations like older individuals, the virus may be reactivated and manifest with a vesicular rash on an erythematous base involving 1–3 adjacent dermatomes along with intense pain and burning. Typically, the pain precedes other symptoms by a couple of days and can result in severe debilitating postherpetic neuralgia once the rash has resolved.","bool":true},{"option":"Type IV hypersensitivity drug reaction","explanation":"A type IV hypersensitivity reaction caused by a drug would indicate erythema multiforme. Though ramipril can cause erythema multiforme, it is one of its rarer side effects. Erythema multiforme manifests with itching as the primary symptom and occurs as pink blotches on the extremities with a blanching center, appearing as a 'target lesion.' It is not limited to adjacent dermatomes. The burning sensation, along with the presence of vesicles and crusting, over 1–3 adjacent dermatomes makes a type IV hypersensitivity drug reaction an unlikely mechanism of the rash.","bool":false},{"option":"Mite burrows into the stratum corneum","explanation":"\nMites burrowing into the stratum corneum refers to Sarcoptes scabiei infesting the superficial layer of the skin. This patient's rash is present under the breast, which is a common site for a scabietic rash. However, scabies is not painful or vesicular in appearance, and rarely manifests as a rash over the back.","bool":false},{"option":"IgA deposits in the upper dermis","explanation":"\nIgA deposits in the upper dermis are immunofluorescence findings of dermatitis herpetiformis. Though the rash typical of dermatitis herpetiformis can have a papulovesicular appearance, it is more chronic, is not limited to adjacent dermatomes, and commonly manifests between the ages of 15–40. Moreover, there is no history suggestive of celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, which is usually associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. Therefore, dermatitis herpetiformis and the presence of IgA deposits in the upper dermis of the skin are unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Infection with a gram-negative bacillus","explanation":"A gram-negative bacillus potentially relevant to this vignette would be Bartonella henselae, which causes cat-scratch disease. Cat-scratch disease might be suspected in this patient because she works in an animal shelter.

However, the pain has lasted for 6 days, and she has no other associated symptoms like dyspnea, diaphoresis, or hemodynamic instability that might suggest an acute myocardial event. The presence of a vesicular rash in adjacent dermatomes and the duration of the pain would therefore make myocardial ischemia an unlikely cause of the patient's symptoms.\n","bool":false},{"option":"Infestation with bloodsucking parasites","explanation":"\nInfestation with bloodsucking parasites might involve a flea infection, as this woman volunteers at an animal shelter regularly. Flea bites would result in itchy papular urticaria and would be more widespread than just the upper back and chest. The presence of vesicles in adjacent dermatomes and preceding burning pain make a flea infestation unlikely in this woman.","bool":false},{"option":"Bacterial lymphatic infection of the epidermis","explanation":"Bacterial infection of the epidermis and superficial lymphatics would indicate erysipelas. Erysipelas is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and results in a well-demarcated erythematous rash along with signs of inflammation. Fever, chills, and myalgia also occur within a couple of days of the rash developing. The burning pain, vesicular rash along adjacent dermatomes, and the absence of systemic signs make erysipelas unlikely.","bool":false},{"option":"Brown recluse spider envenomation","explanation":"\nBrown recluse spider bites commonly go unnoticed and can result in blister formation a couple of hours after the bite. In some cases, they can progress to tissue destruction and necrosis, along with systemic symptoms of fever, myalgias, and nausea. The presence of multiple vesicles along adjacent dermatomes, as well as the preceding burning sensation from the upper back to the chest, make a bite from a brown recluse spider unlikely.\n","bool":false}]},{"id":138,"info":"Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue","question":"\nAn 18-year-old man comes to the emergency department 6 hours after spilling boiling oil on his torso.

Nociceptive nerve endings are intact and the affected areas are extremely tender. Superficial partial-thickness burns heal within 1–3 weeks and lead to hypo/hyperpigmentation but no scarring (see “Classification of burns” table).","bool":true},{"option":"Deep partial-thickness burn","explanation":"\nErythema and blisters may be seen in deep partial-thickness burns (i.e., deep second-degree burns). This type of burn is minimally painful, however, which is inconsistent with this patient's presentation. Deep second-degree burns are dry and do not blanch when pressure is applied. They extend from the epidermis to the deeper dermis, and they also damage surrounding deep dermal appendages and nociceptive nerve endings, which is why affected areas only perceive pressure but no pain. Healing takes 3 weeks or longer and results in scar formation.","bool":false},{"option":"Full-thickness burn","explanation":"\nFull-thickness burns (i.e., third-degree burns) typically do not blister or blanch and are painless, nonerythematous, dry, and associated with tissue necrosis with black, white, or gray leathery skin/eschar, all of which are inconsistent with this patient's presentation. This type of burn extends through the entire dermis and part of the subcutaneous tissue, sparing deeper structures (i.e., muscles, fat, fascia, bones). Third-degree burns do not heal by themselves and have to be managed with early debridement of necrotic tissue, soft skin reconstruction (i.e., grafts, flaps), and antibiotics.","bool":false},{"option":"Deeper injury burns","explanation":"Deeper injury burns (i.e., fourth-degree burns) typically do not blister or blanch and are painless, nonerythematous, and appear white, dry, or charred, all of which are inconsistent with this patient's presentation.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":2,"hint":"This man has developed multiple erythematous plaques and vesicles on his arms after a hiking trip, suggesting allergic contact dermatitis. It is most likely due to exposure to urushiol, the allergenic organic compound in poison ivy.","answers":[{"option":"Apply topical calamine preparation","explanation":"\nManagement of allergic contact dermatitis depends on symptom severity and affected areas. In mild to moderate cases, symptomatic therapy with cool compresses, wet dressings (for oozing, crusting lesions), and calamine lotion (to reduce pruritus) is indicated. Topical corticosteroids can be considered in patients with localized dermatitis. In patients with severe or refractory symptoms or a rash that covers a large or sensitive area of the body (e.g., face, genitals), systemic corticosteroids are indicated.","bool":true},{"option":"Discontinue mesalazine suppositories","explanation":"\nMesalazine is an aminosalicylate used to treat inflammatory bowel disease. While mesalazine can cause urticarial rashes or fixed drug eruption (FDE), which can manifest with erythematous plaques, the first onset of FDE occurs within 2 weeks of exposure to the drug. Additionally, it tends to recur with each exposure to the drug. This man has no history of rashes while using mesalazine. Discontinuing it is not likely to help his pruritus and may actually worsen his ulcerative colitis.","bool":false},{"option":"Counsel patient on alcohol intake","explanation":"\nCounseling patients on alcohol intake is an important element in preventive medicine, especially in conditions like porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) that are exacerbated by alcohol. PCT commonly presents with blisters and erosions in sun-exposed areas – not the plaques and vesicles limited to the upper extremities seen above. Moreover, individuals with PCT have reddish-colored urine, which this man does not have.

The first 3 phases (exudative, resorptive, proliferative) occur over approx. 1 week and the last phase (maturation) proceeds over weeks to months. During the resorptive phase, vasodilation occurs due to the release of cytokines and growth factors (e.g., PDGF, TGF-β) by inflammatory cells, which leads to mild tenderness and redness. A slight increase in leukocyte count and inflammatory markers may also occur after surgery.\nIn the absence of features suggestive of surgical site infection (i.e., severe tenderness, erythema and induration that expands rapidly from the incision site or extends &gt; 5 cm from the wound edge, fever &gt; 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate &gt; 110/min, WBC count &gt; 12,000 cells/mm3), conservative management and reassurance are sufficient.

This condition is a severe form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome characterized by the involvement of &gt; 30% body surface area. Skin lesions typically start on the face and trunk before spreading symmetrically to other areas. These lesions begin as painful, targetoid lesions (e.g., erythematous macules with purpuric centers) that progress to form vesicles and bullae before eventually causing extensive, full-thickness epidermal necrosis and sloughing of the skin at the dermoepidermal junction. Nikolsky sign is typically present. Because TEN also commonly involves the mucous membranes, it can also result in mucositis, ulcers, odynophagia (from pharyngitis), dysphagia (from esophagitis), photophobia (from conjunctivitis), and urogenital complications (e.g., urethritis, genital ulcers).

EM with severe mucosal involvement and systemic symptoms (e.g., fever) is called erythema multiforme major. Unlike the rash seen here, EM skin lesions are typically painless and most commonly begin on the backs of the hands and feet before spreading proximally to involve other areas, including the palms and soles.

The point of entry for pathogens in erysipelas is usually a minor skin lesion (e.g., insect bites, rhagades, athlete's foot, ulcers, blisters) from where the pathogen spreads via lymphatic vessels, resulting in infection of the upper dermis. The lower limbs and face are most commonly affected. Sharply demarcated erythema helps differentiate erysipelas from deep tissue infections such as cellulitis, which are characterized by erythema with indistinct margins. Because GASs typically do not produce penicillinase (unlike S. aureus, the most common cause of other, mostly purulent SSTIs, such as folliculitis), nonsevere erysipelas may be treated with penicillin.","bool":true},{"option":"Clostridium perfringens infection","explanation":"\nGas gangrene is a life-threatening condition that causes crepitus on palpation.

This pathogen sometimes causes nonpurulent cellulitis, which affects the deep tissue and therefore manifests with poorly demarcated erythema. This patient has sharply demarcated erythema. In addition, lymphangitis is typically not discernable in cellulitis; induration is expected instead. This patient has erysipelas, which is not associated with S. aureus infection.\nThis is a difficult question, and S. aureus is a good answer choice to consider because it is the most common cause of purulent SSTIs (e.g., impetigo, abscess, folliculitis). However, nonpurulent SSTIs, especially erysipelas, are more commonly caused by another pathogen. The choice of empiric antibiotic therapy in patients with SSTIs depends on the likelihood of S. aureus involvement. Knowing the microbial spectrum of skin infections has a direct impact on patient care, and using the most specific antibiotic agent (also in empiric approaches) is necessary as part of antimicrobial stewardship.

This patient's underlying skin condition puts him at an increased risk of developing a severe form of chickenpox and complications such as bacterial superinfection and scarring. However, his immunizations are up-to-date and should include the chickenpox vaccine.","bool":false},{"option":"Nonbullous impetigo","explanation":"\nNonbullous impetigo may cause a rash that progresses from papules to small vesicles surrounded by erythema followed by pustules that rupture. However, nonbullous impetigo primarily occurs in young children (2–6 years), is generally not painful, and is not usually accompanied by fever and malaise.","bool":false},{"option":"Scabies","explanation":"\nScabies typically affects the interdigital folds, wrists, and ankles, and patients classically have intense pruritus that is worst at night. Although crowded, unsanitary living conditions are a risk factor for this condition, the rash associated with scabies is not painful. Moreover, fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy are not expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Stevens-Johnson syndrome","explanation":"\nStevens-Johnson syndrome causes a rash associated with fever and malaise and is often triggered by infection (e.g., mycoplasma, herpes simplex virus). However, the rash in this patient is papular in nature, unlike the blistering rash observed in Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Moreover, the rash of Stevens-Johnson syndrome typically involves sloughing and the mucosal membranes are almost always involved.","bool":false},{"option":"Shingles","explanation":"\nShingles is associated with a rash in a dermatomal distribution, typically affecting 1–3 dermatomes on one side of the body. Most patients report severe burning or throbbing pain that is followed by a rash. The rash is initially maculopapular on an erythematous base and quickly progresses to a vesicular rash. Crusting and involution typically occur after 7–10 days. This patient's immunizations are up-to-date and should include the chickenpox vaccine.","bool":false},{"option":"Bed bug bites","explanation":"Crowded living conditions are a risk factor for bed bug infestations.

The majority of patients with DH have gastrointestinal disease related to gluten sensitivity on histopathologic examination, despite lacking gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain). In addition to lifelong avoidance of gluten-containing foods, the first-line treatment of DH is dapsone.\nIf results of IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies, IgA endomysial antibodies, and/or IgA epidermal transglutaminase antibodies in serum are abnormal in a patient with DH, a biopsy of the small intestine is recommended to confirm gluten-sensitive enteropathy.","bool":true},{"option":"Multinucleated giant cells","explanation":"\nMultinucleated giant cells found on scrapings of an ulcer base (i.e., a positive Tzanck smear) indicate herpes simplex virus infections (HSV) or varicella-zoster virus infections (VZV). HSV infections cause grouped, vesicular lesions, which are typically painful (not pruritic) and usually manifest around the mouth (HSV-1) or genital (HSV-2) area. VZV infections cause chickenpox and shingles, which also manifest as vesicular lesions. However, chickenpox causes a more widespread rash, and shingles typically manifests in a dermatomal distribution. Systemic signs (e.g., fever, malaise) are also commonly present.","bool":false},{"option":"Positive Nikolsky sign","explanation":"A positive Nikolsky sign is seen in pemphigus vulgaris, a condition that also manifests with skin blisters. However, these blisters are typically flaccid and usually first appear on the buccal mucosa. In addition, the lesions are characteristically painful (not pruritic).

The prodromal stage is characterized by a classic triad of coryza, cough, and conjunctivitis in combination with Koplik spots. It is followed by an exanthem stage in which patients usually develop a high fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a maculopapular, blanching, partially confluent exanthem that spreads from the face to the entire body. This patient's low-grade fever, postauricular lymphadenopathy, good general condition, and nonconfluent rash are not characteristic of measles.","bool":false},{"option":"Rubella","explanation":"This patient presents with mild nonspecific symptoms (sore throat, low-grade fever, conjunctivitis, headache) and post-auricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy, followed by a nonconfluent, pink maculopapular rash, all of which suggest Rubella infection. The exanthem typically begins on the head, primarily behind the ears, and spreads to the trunk and extremities, sparing the palms and soles. During the prodromal phase, a maculopapular enanthem on the soft palate (Forchheimer sign) may be present.\nRubella was officially eliminated in the US in 2004 by widespread vaccination. However, sporadic cases may occur in unimmunized individuals with a recent history of migration to the US or travel to a country with a higher prevalence of the disease.

Characteristic findings of scarlet fever are Pastia's lines, perioral pallor, and a strawberry tongue. After resolution of the rash, the skin typically desquamates in flakes, exposing new and tender epidermis. The examination findings presented in the case above are not consistent with those of scarlet fever.","bool":false},{"option":"Erythema infectiosum","explanation":"Patients with erythema infectiosum typically manifest with mild flu-like symptoms followed by a rash. The exanthem usually begins in the face as a “slapped-cheek rash” with perioral sparing and subsequently spreads to the trunk and extremities. Adults in particular often present with additional symptoms of arthralgia and symmetrical polyarthritis. The examination findings, in this case, are not consistent with erythema infectiosum.","bool":false},{"option":"Exanthem subitum","explanation":"\nExanthem subitum usually manifests in patients between 6 months and 2 years of age, with almost all children being seropositive by the age of three. The typical presentation begins with a febrile phase, with abrupt onset high fever, cervical and/or postauricular lymphadenopathy, inflamed tympanic membranes, and papular enanthem on the uvula and soft palate (Nagayama spots). After 2–3 days, patients subsequently develop a sudden decrease in temperature and a patchy, rose-pink, confluent, blanching, maculopapular exanthem that begins on the trunk and can spread to the face and extremities. The rash usually fades within a few hours to 2 days and can therefore easily go unnoticed. The patient's age, history of a progressive rash for 2 days, and the finding of a nonconfluent exanthem make another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Chickenpox","explanation":"\nChickenpox can manifest with prodromes such as fever and malaise; however, a rash is typically the first sign of infection. The exanthem typically starts on the trunk and subsequently spreads to the entire body, including the scalp and in some cases affecting the oral and urogenital mucosa, as well as the palms and soles. It is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of various stages of rash (e.g., papules, vesicles, crusts) and severe pruritus. This patient's maculopapular rash is not consistent with chickenpox.","bool":false},{"option":"Allergic drug reaction","explanation":"Allergic drug reactions often present as a type IV hypersensitivity with a red, blanching maculopapular rash beginning on the head, then spreading to the trunk and extremities. While almost any oral medication can result in an allergic reaction, common causes are allopurinol, phenytoin, penicillin, and sulfa antibiotics. The exanthem usually begins 5–14 days after the medication has been initiated and may involve the palms, soles, and mucous membranes. Although this patient was treated with penicillin two weeks ago, the presence of lymphadenopathy without pruritus makes another diagnosis more likely.","bool":false},{"option":"Stevens-Johnson syndrome","explanation":"\nStevens-Johnson syndrome usually begins 1–3 weeks after initiation of a medication (e.g., aminopenicillins, sulfonamides, allopurinol) and manifests with a high fever, myalgia, and a sore throat followed by mucocutaneous lesions. Skin findings include erythematous macules with a targetoid appearance, bullae and/or vesicles, and epidermal necrosis, and sloughing. Involvement of the mucosal membranes is very common and leads to stomatitis, conjunctivitis with photophobia, dysphagia, diarrhea, and a variety of other symptoms.

The lesions are 4–7 mm in size, slightly raised, and do not blanch with pressure. These skin lesions are best classified as which of the following?","difficulty":2,"hint":"Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection can develop cryoglobulinemia, which is characterized by deposition of immune complexes and subsequent vasculitis.","answers":[{"option":"Purpura","explanation":"\nPalpable purpura are raised, violaceous lesions caused by bleeding from small vessels in the skin. Because blood leaks into the extracellular space, these lesions do not completely blanch with pressure (in contrast to telangiectasias). This patient's skin lesions and arthritis are likely caused by cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, in which cryoglobulin immune complexes are deposited in small vessel walls, causing inflammation.","bool":true},{"option":"Spider angioma","explanation":"\nSpider angiomas are often associated with liver cirrhosis, which can develop in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.

XBRT is noninvasive and avoids the cosmetic effects of tissue removal. For this patient, who has a lesion that is clinically suspicious but not yet definitively diagnosed as BCC, XBRT could be a viable option in the further course of management. However, it is not appropriate until the diagnosis has been confirmed and treatment options have been fully considered.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform a punch biopsy of the center of the lesion","explanation":"A biopsy of this patient's suspicious lesion facilitates histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis and provides prognostic information based on the findings. A punch biopsy provides a sample of a portion of the patient's lesion through a relatively simple procedure. However, punch biopsies sample only a limited amount of tissue and thus rarely provide an assessment of tumor histology accurately enough to guide therapy.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform cryotherapy on the lesion","explanation":"\nCryotherapy is rarely used for the treatment of superficial BCC. It is associated with a relatively high rate of recurrence and poorer cosmetic results (e.g., scarring, hypopigmentation) compared to other treatment options. In addition, a diagnosis of BCC needs to be confirmed in this patient before starting treatment. Cryotherapy is a recommended treatment for actinic keratosis. Though actinic keratosis can manifest as a nontender lesion in sun-exposed skin areas, an indurated, nodular lesion with rolled-out edges on the neck is more suggestive of a diagnosis of BCC. If in doubt, a confirmatory biopsy is indicated to distinguish actinic keratosis from BCCs prior to performing cryotherapy.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform a wedge biopsy of the lesion and surrounding tissue","explanation":"Wedge biopsies are used to evaluate a portion of a large lesion. When the size and location of a lesion facilitate complete removal, another biopsy technique is preferred for suspected neoplasms. For this patient's 5-mm lesion, wedge biopsy would likely result in a poor cosmetic outcome and provide no diagnostic advantage for confirming the diagnosis compared to other modalities.","bool":false},{"option":"Administer topical 5-fluorouracil to the lesion","explanation":"Topical 5-fluorouracil is used to treat superficial BCC and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. However, a diagnosis needs to be established prior to treatment. Furthermore, topical 5-FU has a relatively high rate of adverse effects, is dependent on patient adherence, and has lower clearance rates than other treatment modalities. Therefore, its use is limited to cases in which patients have small tumors in low-risk locations (e.g., the trunk or extremities) and will not or cannot undergo treatment with surgery or other effective therapies.","bool":false},{"option":"Perform Mohs microsurgery on the lesion","explanation":"\nMohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is indicated in the treatment of BCC with a high risk for recurrence and/or for tumors that involve cosmetically and/or functionally sensitive areas. Criteria for high risk of recurrence include size ≥ 6 mm on the face and aggressive pathologic features such as keratinizing or morpheaform appearance. Though this patient's lesion is located on the neck, it is not considered to be in a cosmetically sensitive area. Even in cases in which the clinical diagnosis of BCC appears certain, histopathologic confirmation is indicated before any therapeutic measure (such as MMS) is performed.

Also, this boy does not have any of the symptoms that are typically concomitantly present in measles, such as cough, conjunctivitis, or generalized lymphadenopathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Rubella","explanation":"While this patient's fever, headache, myalgia, coryza, and development of a rash could be signs of rubella, the rash seen in rubella is usually only mildly pruritic, maculopapular, and not associated with any vesicles or crusted lesions. Also, affected children commonly have concomitant postauricular and/or suboccipital lymphadenopathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Erythema infectiosum","explanation":"Patients with erythema infectiosum also present with fever and a pruritic rash. However, erythema infectiosum rash is usually only mildly pruritic and initially pronounced on the cheeks (i.e., slapped‑cheek rash) before spreading to the extremities and trunk where it adopts a lace-like and reticular appearance. This patient's highly pruritic rash with fluid-filled vesicles and crusted lesions is inconsistent with erythema infectiosum.","bool":false},{"option":"Roseola infantum","explanation":"\nRoseola infantum primarily affects children between 2 months and 2 years of age and typically manifests with a very high fever that ends abruptly before the sudden appearance of a rash. In contrast, this patient's fever and exanthema are present at the same time. Also, his rash is both maculopapular and papulovesicular, different from the rose-pink maculopapular, patchy, blanching exanthem typically seen in roseola infantum. In addition, roseola infantum almost always presents with cervical, postauricular, and/or occipital lymphadenopathy.","bool":false},{"option":"Rocky Mountain spotted fever","explanation":"The patient was on a hiking trip which puts him at risk for tick bites and contracting tick-borne diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). Although fever, headache, and myalgia are commonly seen in patients with RMSF, these symptoms usually occur several days prior to the onset of a rash. Also, the rash seen in RMSF is not associated with crusts and vesicles and typically follows a particular pattern that begins on the wrists and ankles, then spreads to the trunk, palms, and soles.","bool":false},{"option":"Urushiol-induced dermatitis","explanation":"This patient was on a recent hiking trip, putting him at risk for skin exposure to urushiol-containing plants, which can result in urushiol-induced contact dermatitis.

It dilutes and removes the offending agent from the skin. Irrigation should be continued until the pH of the affected tissue has become neutral, which may take several hours in case of alkaline burns.\nThe only exceptions to this rule are burns caused by elemental metals (e.g., potassium, magnesium) and dry lime. In these cases, adding water can cause a chemical reaction that would worsen the burn; mineral oil should be used instead.","bool":true},{"option":"Perform escharotomy","explanation":"Emergency escharotomy is indicated if vascular compromise is suspected (e.g., compartment syndrome), which is especially common in the case of peripheral, circumferential burns with the presence of eschar.

Miliaria rubra is the most prevalent form of miliaria and manifests with a pruritic, papulovesicular, erythematous rash, typically on the intertriginous areas of the groin, axillae, and neck. Management of miliaria rubra consists of measures to reduce sweating and occlusion of eccrine glands, such as keeping the patient in a cool environment, wearing breathable clothing (e.g., cotton), lightly scrubbing the skin to remove debris that can clog sweat glands, and, if nonpharmacologic measures fail to reduce the rash, administering topical steroids to decrease inflammation.","bool":true},{"option":"Reassurance only","explanation":"Reassurance alone is appropriate for self-limited, asymptomatic rashes.

Certain medications, such as captopril, glyburide, thiol-containing drugs (e.g., penicillamine), and phenol-containing drugs (e.g., cephalosporins, rifampicin, phenobarbital, aspirin), can induce the formation of these autoantibodies. Since desmosomal adhesion proteins enable keratinocyte adherence, damage to these proteins causes intraepidermal bullae formation and a positive Nikolsky sign. The lesions typically occur first on mucous membranes and can become confluent or erode to form painful ulcers.\nPemphigus vulgaris is treated with high-dose systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications (e.g., azathioprine, IVIG, rituximab).

These burns only involve the superficial epidermis and spare the dermis. The keratin barrier thus remains intact, retaining fluid and barring microbial entry. For this reason, no antimicrobial prophylaxis, fluid support, or debridement is necessary. Oral NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) may be given for pain and inflammation associated with sunburns. Important preventative measures to avoid sunburns include avoidance of direct sunlight (especially during midday), protective clothing, and application of broad-spectrum sunscreens (with sun protective factor ≥ 30) 15–30 minutes prior to sun exposure.

Risk factors for decubitus ulcer formation include immobility and sensory loss, as seen in this patient who has a history of spinal cord injury and diabetes mellitus. In addition to analgesia, treatment of an uninfected stage 2 decubitus ulcer includes regular cleaning and dressing changes. Various types of dressings can be used; hydrocolloid dressings are absorptive and promote autolytic debridement. Frequent repositioning of the patient can reduce the duration and magnitude of pressure over vulnerable areas of the body, such as the sacrum, heels, and other bony prominences. Other strategies to prevent and treat decubitus ulcers include optimizing the patient's nutritional status and protein supplementation.\nAntibiotic therapy should be initiated in patients with cellulitis, systemic signs of infection, and/or underlying osteomyelitis.

Since both S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes are catalase-negative, coagulase-negative, beta-hemolytic, capsulated cocci that can form mucoid colonies, the susceptibility to bacitracin can be used to differentiate the two species. The other lab findings that differentiate S. pyogenes from S. agalactiae are a negative Hippurate test and a positive pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (PYR) test. S. pyogenes can cause pharyngitis, tonsillitis, scarlet fever, a broad spectrum of skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis), toxic shock syndrome, and certain postinfectious immunological phenomena (e.g., PSGN, rheumatic fever).","bool":true},{"option":"Resistance to optochin","explanation":"Resistance to optochin is a characteristic of viridans streptococci (e.g., S. sanguis, S. mutans), which cause dental caries and subacute bacterial endocarditis, not skin infections such as erysipelas.

Typical locations include the scalp (hence the term “cradle cap”), forehead, nose, external ear, umbilical area, and intertriginous areas. The pathophysiology is not yet fully understood but colonization of areas around sebaceous glands with the yeast Malassezia furfur appears to be a contributing factor. In some patients (especially in adults) active phases are triggered by an inadequate or abnormal immune response to the yeast (e.g., due to stress, fatigue, or cold temperatures) leading to an inflammatory reaction of the skin. Seborrheic dermatitis is more common in patients with a family history of psoriasis.\nThe condition usually resolves spontaneously (within three to four months), but regular bathing, the use of baby shampoos, and the application of an emulsifying ointment can help relieve symptoms.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","difficulty":1,"hint":"The first-line therapy for trigeminal neuralgia is carbamazepine, which is the most likely trigger of this patient's mucocutaneous immune reaction.","answers":[{"option":"Stevens-Johnson syndrome","explanation":"\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a rare yet serious adverse effect of carbamazepine, as well as many other drugs (e.g., phenytoin, lamotrigine, and valproate). It initially manifests with fever and flu-like symptoms (e.g., chills and myalgias). The classic cutaneous manifestation consists of painful, erythematous, annular macules with pruritic centers that begin on the face and thorax and spread symmetrically to the extremities, which are accompanied by stomatitis, mucositis, conjunctivitis, and/or corneal ulceration. Physical examination often shows a positive Nikolsky sign, as seen in this patient. The skin desquamation may progress to involve large areas of the skin. Involvement of &gt; 30% of the total body surface area is referred to as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), whereas involvement of 10–30% is considered SJS/TEN overlap. Treatment of SJS includes discontinuation of the offending drug and supportive therapy similar to that of burns (fluid resuscitation, wound management, antibiotics in case of infection). Cyclosporine may slow SJS progression.","bool":true},{"option":"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome","explanation":"\nStaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is caused by S. aureus exfoliative toxin. SSSS manifests with systemic symptoms (e.g., fever and malaise) and diffuse, flaccid bullae along the flexural surfaces, hands, feet, and buttock; the Nikolsky sign is typically positive. However, SSSS is most often seen in the pediatric population following a staphylococcal infection (e.g., impetigo), which this adult patient has no history of. Finally, mucosal involvement, as seen in this patient, would be very unusual.","bool":false},{"option":"Erythema multiforme","explanation":"\nErythema multiforme (EM) is most commonly associated with herpes simplex virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections but can also rarely occur as an adverse effect of carbamazepine. EM causes erythematous, target-shaped lesions. Erythema multiforme major, a subform of EM, manifests with mucosal involvement and systemic symptoms such as fever. EM lesions are usually painless and classically arise as a symmetrical distribution on the acral and extensor surfaces of the extremities, which then spreads proximally and may include the palms and soles.","bool":false},{"option":"Pemphigus vulgaris","explanation":"\nPemphigus vulgaris (PV) classically manifests with cutaneous flaccid bullae that can affect the oral mucosa but spare the palms and soles. The bullae have a positive Nikolsky sign and tend to rupture easily, leading to significant pain and bleeding; however, pruritus would not be expected following rupture.

Hormonal changes (e.g., pregnancy, oral contraceptive use) seem to play an important role in the development of this condition. Melasma can be triggered and/or exacerbated by exposure to sunlight. Avoiding sunlight and/or applying broad-spectrum sunscreen during pregnancy can prevent or slow the progression of melasma. Topical treatment with depigmenting agents such as hydroxyquinone may be used in severe cases.\nLinea nigra and areolar darkening can also develop during pregnancy as a result of endocrine changes but, unlike melasma, these two forms of cutaneous hyperpigmentation are not associated with sun exposure.","bool":true},{"option":"Autoimmunity","explanation":"\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that typically affects middle-aged women and can manifest with skin lesions on sun-exposed areas. However, patients with SLE typically have a malar erythematous rash with sparing of the nasolabial folds, rather than the hyperpigmented macules seen here. Moreover, individuals with SLE usually have additional symptoms such as arthralgia, fatigue, fever, and/or weight loss. This patient's skin findings are not the result of autoimmunity.","bool":false},{"option":"Insulin resistance","explanation":"\nInsulin resistance is associated with acanthosis nigricans, which is characterized by velvety hyperpigmentation of skin folds (e.g., axilla, nape of the neck) and does not involve the face.

This patient's skin findings are not the result of a fungal infection.","bool":false},{"option":"Hypersensitivity","explanation":"\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) are examples of cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. In adults, AD can manifest as hyperpigmented lesions, but these lesions are typically found on the flexor surfaces of extremities, not the face, and would be lichenified. Moreover, patients with AD have a history of recurrent flares of pruritic, scaly, erythematous lesions on the face and extensor surfaces during infancy, and on the flexural creases during childhood. ACD caused by UV light (photoallergy), poison ivy (urushiol contact dermatitis), or cosmetic products can affect the face. The history of recent travel and enlargement of the lesions in summer can suggest photoallergy but, as with AD, individuals experiencing a first episode of ACD would have erythematous rather than hyperpigmented macules. It is unlikely that this patient's skin findings are caused by a hypersensitivity reaction.","bool":false},{"option":"Enzyme defect","explanation":"\nNonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are examples of conditions that are caused by enzyme defects and associated with adult-onset hyperpigmentation. In PCT, hyperpigmentation occurs in sun-exposed regions, such as the face, and it manifests in a melasma-like pattern. However, patients with PCT have a history of increased skin fragility and blistering. The hyperpigmentation of CAH typically occurs in areas that are not sun-exposed, such as the areola, genitalia, axilla, palms, and oral mucous membranes. Moreover, female individuals with nonclassic CAH usually have virilizing features (e.g., hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, acne).

It is most commonly found on the lateral aspect of the tongue and, less commonly, on the floor of the mouth, palate, or buccal mucosa. OHL is strongly associated with immunosuppressive states, e.g., in patients with HIV, those undergoing chemotherapy, and organ transplant recipients. Therefore, all patients with OHL should be tested for HIV. OHL is self-limited and typically improves after antiretroviral therapy has been initiated; therefore, no additional management is indicated.","bool":true},{"option":"Topical nystatin therapy","explanation":"Topical nystatin can be used to treat oral candidiasis (thrush), which often affects patients with HIV and manifests with nontender white oral lesions. However, oral candidiasis can typically be scraped off, leaving a bleeding base on the oral mucosa.

As this patient has a history of severe penicillin allergy, the first-line treatment options (penicillin V or amoxicillin) are contraindicated and a macrolide such as azithromycin should be used instead. Patients with a history of mild allergic reaction to penicillin (e.g., rash) can be treated with an oral cephalosporin.\nIdeally, before treatment is initiated, group A streptococcal infection should be confirmed with rapid strep test and/or throat culture in order to avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotics.","bool":true},{"option":"Amoxicillin therapy","explanation":"\nAmoxicillin is often given as the treatment of choice for scarlet fever in children.

However, early Lyme disease manifests with erythema chronicum migrans rather than a generalized rash. While RMSF manifests with a blanching maculopapular rash, the rash typically begins on the wrists and ankles, spreads to the trunk, palms, and soles, and becomes petechial and/or hemorrhagic. Moreover, RMSF is associated with further symptoms such as swelling of the ankles and/or wrists as well as gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. This patient's exudative tonsillitis and perioral pallor suggest scarlet fever, for which doxycycline is not indicated.","bool":false},{"option":"Immunoglobulin therapy","explanation":"\nIntravenous immunoglobulins are not indicated for infections such as scarlet fever, but are used to treat a variety of conditions, including Kawasaki disease.

Initially, actinic keratosis manifests as small lesions with a central scale and a rough surface, giving them a sandpaper-like texture on palpation. Later, the lesions may grow and become erythematous and scaly, as seen in this patient. The risk of progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma depends on the degree of epithelial dysplasia, but it is &lt; 1% per year. Occasionally, hyperkeratosis may turn preexisting actinic keratosis lesions into cutaneous horns.\nActinic keratosis is usually a clinical diagnosis, although for lesions that are ≥ 1 cm, grow rapidly, or do not respond to treatment, a biopsy is necessary to distinguish it from squamous cell carcinoma.

This complication occurs in the early phase of warfarin therapy when anticoagulant factors, proteins C and S, are depleted faster than procoagulant factors, inducing a hypercoagulable state that can lead to the development of microthrombi. Individuals with protein C deficiency are at increased risk for this complication. Immediate management includes discontinuation of warfarin and administration of intravenous vitamin K, heparin, and a source of protein C (protein C concentrate or FFP).

Bendazoles (e.g., albendazole, mebendazole) are another drug class commonly recommended for the treatment of pinworm infection; although these agents can be used after the first trimester, there is conflicting evidence regarding teratogenicity. If treatment is indicated, all household contacts should be treated simultaneously, because pinworm infections are highly contagious and reinfections are common.","bool":true},{"option":"Metronidazole","explanation":"\nMetronidazole is not used for the treatment of enterobiasis. This antibiotic is the first-line agent for the treatment of trichomoniasis, which manifests with vulvovaginal pruritus. However, ova on a tape test are not a typical finding. Instead, protozoa with multiple flagella would be visible on a wet mount of a vaginal smear. Moreover, patients with this condition usually have foul-smelling purulent vaginal discharge accompanied by a burning sensation, dyspareunia, dysuria, and an erythematous cervical mucosa with petechiae (strawberry cervix), none of which have been reported. Metronidazole is also indicated for treating bacterial vaginosis, which is most commonly asymptomatic and has a characteristic finding of clue cells on a wet mount.","bool":false},{"option":"Fluconazole","explanation":"\nFluconazole is not used for the treatment of enterobiasis. This antifungal is the first-line agent for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis, which manifests with vaginal pruritus. However, ova on a tape test is not characteristic of this condition. Moreover, this drug should be avoided in this patient because the safety of administering fluconazole in pregnancy has not been established.","bool":false},{"option":"Praziquantel","explanation":"\nPraziquantel is not used for the treatment of enterobiasis. Praziquantel is effective against Schistosoma spp. and tapeworms such as Taenia spp. (e.g., intestinal taeniasis and neurocysticercosis) and Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm), but these infections do not present with perianal pruritus.","bool":false},{"option":"Ivermectin","explanation":"\nIvermectin is generally not used for the treatment of enterobiasis. Although it does have some efficacy against E. vermicularis, it is not effective enough to be considered for monotherapy. Ivermectin is the drug of choice for the treatment of infection with Strongyloides spp. or Onchocerca volvulus, but these infections do not manifest with perianal pruritus. Moreover, this medication is sometimes used as a second-line agent for treatment-refractory pediculosis pubis, which may manifest with pruritus in the genital and perianal regions. However, patients with pubic lice typically present with excoriations in the affected body area and lice or nits would be visible in the pubic hair rather than ova on a tape test. Finally, this drug should be avoided in this patient because the safety of administering ivermectin in pregnancy has not been established.","bool":false}]},{"id":227,"info":"Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue","question":"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a generalized pruritic rash for 14 hours. Five days ago, he had pink eyes that resolved spontaneously. He has acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He has received 3 cycles of chemotherapy with vincristine, asparaginase, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin. His last treatment cycle was 2 weeks ago. The patient's other medications include multivitamin supplements. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 90/min, and blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows multiple crops of macules and papules over the face, trunk, and extremities. There are also excoriation marks and crusted lesions. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","difficulty":4,"hint":"This child has a widespread, severely pruritic rash that presents with lesions at various stages (macules, papules, and crusted lesions), which is indicative of chickenpox. He recently finished a cycle of chemotherapy and he has acute leukemia, both of which make him more susceptible to infection.","answers":[{"option":"Acyclovir administration","explanation":"\nAcyclovir is the antiviral drug of choice used to treat chickenpox in immunocompromised patients. These individuals are at risk of the disease taking a generalized or even fatal course. This patient should receive antiviral treatment within 24 hours of onset of the varicella rash to reduce the duration and the severity of the disease, as well as the risk of complications.\nChickenpox should also be treated in adults, unvaccinated adolescents, individuals on long-term salicylate therapy (due to an increased risk of Reye syndrome), children taking corticosteroids, and in patients with a history of chronic skin or lung disease. Possible serious complications that may result from chickenpox, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, include pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, acute cerebellitis, or bleeding disorders.","bool":true},{"option":"Vitamin A administration","explanation":"Administration of vitamin A can reduce mortality in patients with measles. Measles commonly manifests with a prodromal stage of coryza, cough, and conjunctivitis and during the exanthem stage, high fever is present. The measles rash appears as an erythematous maculopapular, blanching, partially confluent exanthem. Although this boy had conjunctivitis, he only has a mild fever. Also, he did not have any other prodrome and his skin findings are more consistent with chickenpox. Vitamin A administration has not been proven to be beneficial in patients with chickenpox.","bool":false},{"option":"Penicillin V administration","explanation":"Oral penicillin V may be used to treat bacterial infections such as scarlet fever, which is a common cause of childhood rashes. This patient does not display the typical findings of scarlet fever (e.g., tonsillopharyngitis, flush cheeks, perioral pallor) and his rash with crusted lesions looks different from the sandpaper-like rash normally associated with scarlet fever. Because his findings suggest chickenpox (caused by a viral infection), antibiotics are of no use.","bool":false},{"option":"Symptomatic therapy","explanation":"In healthy children, chickenpox generally has a benign course and heals without any consequences. Symptomatic treatment with topical applications (e.g., calamine lotion) or oral H1-antihistamines for pruritus is generally adequate. Because this child has a history of acute leukemia and a recent course of chemotherapy, he is immunocompromised and at greater risk of the disease taking a generalized or even fatal course. Therefore, symptomatic therapy alone is not sufficient; specific treatment should be initiated.","bool":false},{"option":"Immunoglobulin administration","explanation":"\nVaricella-zoster (VZV) immunoglobulin should be administered in immunosuppressed individuals with no evidence of immunity as postexposure prophylaxis (passive immunization) to chickenpox, to prevent disease onset or mitigate the disease course. Although VZV immunoglobulin may be given as late as 10 days following exposure, maximum benefit is conferred when given as soon as possible.

She says that her nails look “so ugly” that she is afraid to show her hands in public. The changes began on the fourth finger of each hand before progressing to all of her fingers and toes. Treatment with terbinafine has provided no relief. During the same time, she has also noticed that she is perspiring more than usual. The patient has not had any fever, cough, or changes in bowel habits. Her menses occur at irregular 40- and 50-day intervals. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She has a seizure disorder and a history of migraine headaches. Current medications are valproic acid and over-the-counter ibuprofen. She has followed a strict vegan diet since the age of 22 years.

Excessive sweating, oligomenorrhea, tachycardia, and systolic hypertension (with widened pulse pressure) indicate that hyperthyroidism is the most likely cause of this patient's nail changes. The presence of pretibial myxedema (nonpitting plaques and/or nodules on the shins) indicates that this patient's hyperthyroidism is due to Graves disease. Patients with Graves disease can also develop nail clubbing due to thyroid acropachy in the late stages of the disease.","bool":true},{"option":"Menopause","explanation":"\nMenopause occurs in women 45–55 years of age and can cause episodic vasomotor symptoms (e.g., excessive sweating, tachycardia). Also, during the menopausal transition, menses become irregular and decrease in frequency. However, this patient has onycholysis and nonpitting plaques, which are not features of menopause.","bool":false},{"option":"Iron deficiency","explanation":"Chronic undernutrition from dietary restriction can result in menstrual irregularities and micronutrient deficiencies. Iron deficiency can result in nail changes, and severe anemia may lead to tachycardia and widened pulse pressure. However, nail changes due to iron deficiency include brittle nails and koilonychia rather than onycholysis. In addition, excessive sweating and nonpitting plaques on the shins are not typical features of either iron deficiency or undernutrition.","bool":false},{"option":"Psoriasis","explanation":"\nPsoriasis can cause nail changes (e.g., onycholysis, nail pitting, oil drop sign) and plaques on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. However, the menstrual irregularities and vasomotor features (e.g., excessive sweating, systolic hypertension) seen in this patient are not manifestations of psoriasis.","bool":false},{"option":"Adverse effect of medication","explanation":"\nValproic acid may cause onycholysis, but nonpitting plaques on the shins, menstrual changes, and vasomotor features (e.g., excessive sweating, systolic hypertension) are not common.

This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The varicose veins, brown skin discoloration, and corona phlebectatica in this patient are signs of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).","answers":[{"option":"Ulceration of the skin","explanation":"In CVI defective venous valve leaflets lead to reflux of venous blood back into the periphery, resulting in increased venous pressure (hydrostatic pressure) and subsequent extravasation of venous blood into the interstitium. Plasma proteins in the interstitium, in turn, cause edema and tissue hypoperfusion, which results in stasis dermatitis, lipodermatosclerosis, and, in some cases, ulcer formation. Venous ulcers tend to occur over the shin and medial malleolus and are shallow, tender, and surrounded by hyperpigmented skin.","bool":true},{"option":"Thrombosis of a deep vein","explanation":"\nThrombosis of a deep vein is associated with increased age, a history of smoking, inherited thrombophilias, OCP use, and malignancy. While superficial thrombophlebitis and thrombosis are common in CVI, deep vein thrombosis is rare.","bool":false},{"option":"Osmotic injury to the peripheral nerves","explanation":"Patients with untreated diabetes mellitus (DM) are at increased risk of osmotic injury to the peripheral nerves (diabetic neuropathy). Patients with untreated DM often develop pathologies in the lower extremities (e.g., skin and soft tissue infections, ischemic or neuropathic ulcers) but the dilated veins seen in the photograph suggest CVI, which does not result in peripheral nerve injury.","bool":false},{"option":"Biliverdin accumulation in the epidermis","explanation":"Accumulation of biliverdin in the epidermis is responsible for the hyperpigmentation seen following subcutaneous hematoma formation. However, in CVI, hyperpigmentation is due to the dermal deposition of hemosiderin, which occurs over time as extravasated RBCs are broken down.","bool":false},{"option":"Malignant transformation of lymphatic endothelium","explanation":"Malignant transformation of lymphatic endothelium causes lymphangiosarcoma, a rare malignancy that is due to chronic lymphedema rather than CVI.

Which of the following types of sensory receptors is most likely activated by this examination technique?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The signals from this sensory receptor are relayed through the dorsal column.","answers":[{"option":"Pacinian corpuscles","explanation":"\nPacinian corpuscles sense high-frequency (100–400 Hz) vibrations, deep touch, and mechanical pressure. They are located in the deep layers of the skin (e.g., dermis and subcutaneous layer), ligaments, and joints. Pacinian corpuscles are very rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that are innervated by large myelinated fibers, which facilitate very rapid signal propagation. They are, therefore, able to detect rapid vibrations and facilitate the discrimination of fine surface textures.\nDiabetic neuropathy affects large myelinated nerves and results in the loss of vibration sense and proprioception; damage to small nerve fibers (e.g., Aδ fibers and C fibers) causes pain, paresthesias, and allodynia.","bool":true},{"option":"Ruffini corpuscles","explanation":"\nRuffini corpuscles, which are located in the fingertips and joints, are slow-adapting mechanoreceptors that sense mechanical pressure, objects slipping along the skin surface, and joint-angle changes. They do not detect vibrations.","bool":false},{"option":"Meissner corpuscles","explanation":"\nMeissner corpuscles, which are located in superficial layers of hairless skin (e.g., epidermis and upper dermis of the fingertips and eyelids), are rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that sense dynamic, fine, and light touch, position, and low-frequency vibrations (30–50 Hz).

Although the exact etiology is unknown, pityriasis rosea is thought to be triggered by a viral infection. Some patients experience a prodromal phase with flu-like symptoms 1–2 weeks prior to rash onset, as seen here. The initial eruption typically appears as a single ovoid macule that is 2–10 cm in diameter, also known as a herald patch. This plaque is usually salmon-colored, slightly raised, and surrounded by a scaly, white collarette. The secondary eruption develops about 2–21 days later and is characterized by bilateral diffuse, oval-shaped papules and plaques that are smaller than the herald patch.

In addition, patients with Lyme disease often have flu-like symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Unlike in this 10-year-old girl, however, lesions of erythema migrans are neither scaly nor pruritic and, instead, have a typical bull's-eye appearance. Finally, in Lyme disease, the secondary eruption develops weeks after the primary lesion, whereas this patient's secondary eruption developed a few days after the initial one.","bool":false},{"option":"Guttate psoriasis","explanation":"\nGuttate psoriasis most commonly occurs after streptococcal infections, which can manifest with fever, sore throat, and pharyngeal inflammation. Although guttate psoriasis also originates from the trunk and manifests with numerous, erythematous, scaly lesions, the papules are typically droplet-shaped and smaller than the lesions seen in this patient. Additionally, the rash does not start with a single, larger lesion followed by a secondary eruption of smaller, similar lesions.","bool":false},{"option":"Tinea corporis","explanation":"\nTinea corporis manifests with pruritic, round, erythematous plaques with scaling, central clearing, and raised borders, similar to what is seen in this patient.

Although the initial appearance can vary (e.g., plaque-like, nodular, papillomatous), all forms eventually ulcerate. SCC lesions are locally invasive and bleed easily when touched. The most important risk factor for this condition is exposure to UV light (e.g., due to chronic occupational sun exposure); sun-exposed areas of skin (e.g., the lower lip) are the most commonly affected. Other important risk factors for SCC include exposure to chemical carcinogens (e.g., coal tars via smoking), ionizing radiation, and a positive history of precancerous lesions (e.g., actinic keratosis).

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?","difficulty":2,"hint":"The eruption of multiple, nontender, and nonpruritic white macules with fine scaling after traveling to a warm, humid climate should raise suspicion for tinea versicolor.","answers":[{"option":"Increased growth of Malassezia globosa","explanation":"\nTinea versicolor is most commonly caused by increased growth of Malassezia globosa or other fungi of the Malassezia genus (e.g., Malassezia furfur), which belong to the physiological flora of the skin. Affected individuals typically present with abnormal pigmentation (can vary from white to brown or reddish-brown) involving the trunk, chest, back, and/or abdomen following a history of travel to a humid and warm place, such as the Caribbean. Both higher temperatures and humidity provide an ideal environment for the pathogen, which predisposes to overgrowth. The lesions become more apparent after UV exposure or tanning because the surrounding skin gets darker, which provides greater contrast to the lesions. Topical antifungals are the first-line therapy, e.g., selenium sulfide lotion or shampoo, topical ketoconazole, or terbinafine.","bool":true},{"option":"Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes","explanation":"Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes may play a role in the development of vitiligo. This theory is supported by the fact that almost 20% of patients with vitiligo patients have coexisting autoimmune diseases.

Management includes daily cleansing with water and soap and avoidance of oils and lotions, which can occlude the skin and exacerbate this condition. More severe cases can be treated with topical antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole cream) and mild topical corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone cream).","bool":true},{"option":"Breathable fabrics and avoidance of heat","explanation":"Breathable fabrics and avoidance of heat are measures used to avoid and treat miliaria rubra. Although miliaria rubra also manifests with an erythematous, papulopustular rash, it more commonly develops in areas that are prone to sweating and occlusion (e.g., intertriginous skin folds of the neck, axilla, and groin). Breathable fabrics and avoidance of heat are unlikely to improve neonatal cephalic pustulosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Topical mupirocin therapy","explanation":"Topical mupirocin is used to treat impetigo, which can manifest with erythematous papules and pustules.

Topical mupirocin is not used to treat neonatal cephalic pustulosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Topical tacrolimus therapy","explanation":"Topical tacrolimus is used to treat atopic dermatitis, often in conjunction with topical corticosteroids. Atopic dermatitis can manifest in infancy with an erythematous rash on the face but more commonly results in scaly, eczematous plaques without pustules. In addition, these lesions are often intensely pruritic and cause discomfort and irritability. Topical tacrolimus is not used to treat neonatal cephalic pustulosis.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral isotretinoin therapy","explanation":"Oral isotretinoin can be used to treat severe infantile acne. Although this condition usually manifests with erythematous papules and pustules, the presentation is usually much more severe than that of neonatal cephalic pustulosis and also includes comedones (and sometimes nodules).

Bacillary angiomatosis is often seen in patients with AIDS. It can also manifest with multiple painless violaceous nodules on the skin and is, therefore, an important differential diagnosis for Kaposi sarcoma. However, a biopsy of these lesions is likely to show neutrophilic infiltration rather than the lymphocytic infiltration seen in this patient. Doxycycline would not be effective in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n\n\n","bool":false},{"option":"Amphotericin B","explanation":"\nAmphotericin B is an antifungal agent used in the treatment of severe fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and cryptococcosis, which can occasionally present with cutaneous manifestations.

He does not know how long the lesion has been present. He reports that he does not have any pain; he only occasionally feels the prosthesis rubbing on his stump. His sister reports that the lesion has gotten larger since she first discovered it 2 weeks ago. She bought him some antibacterial ointment, which he has used inconsistently. The amputation was uncomplicated and postoperative visits showed good wound healing. He started physical therapy 2.5 weeks ago. The patient has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 45 years. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, liraglutide, insulin, atorvastatin, and aspirin. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg.

Management of a noninfected (normal vital signs, nontender ulcer, nonpurulent drainage, and no signs of surrounding inflammation), nonnecrotic stump ulcer includes pressure relief, adequate skincare, frequent wound checks, and ensuring a proper prosthetic socket fit. To achieve and maintain a proper, individualized fit, which is especially important in patients with risk factors for poor wound healing (e.g., diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, poor circulation), regular evaluation with socket and liner modifications as needed is recommended.","bool":true},{"option":"Surgical debridement","explanation":"Surgical debridement is indicated in the management of ulcers that are nonhealing, necrotic, increasing in size, or complicated by deep infections. This patient is afebrile and his ulcer is nontender, draining nonpurulent fluid, and does not show signs of necrosis or adjacent infection. Therefore, the ulcer is likely to heal with appropriate conservative management.","bool":false},{"option":"Above-the-knee amputation","explanation":"Above-the-knee amputation is generally the last resort reserved for nonhealing, necrotic, or limb/life-threatening infections (e.g., necrotizing fasciitis) or chronic limb-threatening ischemia that has failed to respond to all other treatments. This patient is afebrile and his ulcer is nontender, draining nonpurulent fluid, and does not show signs of necrosis or adjacent infection. Therefore, the ulcer is likely to heal with appropriate conservative management.","bool":false},{"option":"Bone biopsy","explanation":"A bone biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis of osteomyelitis and to obtain specimens for Gram staining and culture and sensitivity testing, as the culture yield from wound swabs is low and frequently contaminated with normal skin flora. Osteomyelitis may develop due to a contiguous spread from an infected full-thickness stump ulcer. However, this afebrile patient's ulcer is superficial, nontender, draining nonpurulent fluid, and does not show signs of adjacent infection. Therefore, it is unlikely the ulcer or adjacent tissues are infected.","bool":false},{"option":"Wound swab for culture","explanation":"A wound swab for culture is indicated for stump ulcers that become infected, which can manifest with pain, and drainage. However, infected wound sites typically manifest with a fever, foul odor, surrounding tenderness, erythema, swelling, and warmth. This afebrile patient's ulcer is nontender, draining serous fluid, and does not have signs of infection, making a different management option more appropriate.","bool":false},{"option":"Oral clindamycin","explanation":"Oral clindamycin is an antibiotic that is commonly prescribed empirically for skin and soft tissue infections after culture specimens have been collected (e.g., wound swab, blood cultures). Signs of an infected ulcer include fever, pain, purulent drainage, foul odor, surrounding tenderness, erythema, swelling, and warmth.

Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition?","difficulty":3,"hint":"The picture shows a black eschar characteristic of cutaneous anthrax.","answers":[{"option":"Wool handling","explanation":"\nCutaneous anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, which is most commonly transmitted via contact with infected animals or infected animal products (e.g., wool, hide, meat). The lesions in cutaneous anthrax typically begin as papules that expand and become painless eschars surrounded by extensive edema. Lymphadenopathy is also common. The disease can be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and headache and rarely progresses to bacteremia or death.","bool":true},{"option":"Spider bite","explanation":"A spider bite by the brown recluse spider (which releases a necrotic toxin) can cause a painless papule that progresses to a necrotic black eschar, similar to the lesion seen in this patient. Systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise are sometimes also seen. However, brown recluse spider bites typically become extremely painful within a few hours, and multiple lesions would be unusual.","bool":false},{"option":"Drug exposure","explanation":"Drug reactions can manifest with several different cutaneous findings (e.g., drug rash, fixed drug reaction). However, there is no known drug that would cause an isolated eschar with surrounding edema, as seen in this patient. Furthermore, his systemic symptoms (fever, headache, lymphadenopathy) are more suggestive of an infection than of an adverse drug reaction.","bool":false},{"option":"Cat scratch","explanation":"\nCat scratch disease, caused by Bartonella henselae transmitted from cat scratches or bites, causes lesions that begin as a single papule or vesicle. However, the hallmark sign of the disease is the development of tender regional lymphadenopathy. A necrotic eschar would not be expected.","bool":false},{"option":"Pool swimming","explanation":"Swimming in pools is a risk factor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis (hot tub folliculitis). It typically develops within 48 hours after exposure to the pathogen in pools or tubs and presents with tender and pruritic papules, pustules, or nodules. Most patients can have associated malaise and low-grade fever. However, an isolated necrotic eschar would not be seen.","bool":false},{"option":"Sexual contact","explanation":"\nPrimary syphilis can present with a chancre, usually in the genital region.

Symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia include intense pain, numbness, and allodynia in the affected dermatome that persist beyond 3 months after initial healing of the rash. In addition to being a risk factor for shingles, immunosuppression likely increases the risk of postherpetic neuralgia. Early antiviral therapy speeds up the resolution of lesions, decreases pain, and reduces the risk of postherpetic neuralgia. ","bool":true},{"option":"Loss of vision","explanation":"Loss of vision can occur as a complication of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), in which the majority of patients experience direct involvement of the eye. Early diagnosis and antiviral treatment are essential in preventing vision loss as a result of HZO uveitis, iritis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and optic neuritis. HZO manifests with grouped vesicles, as seen in this patient; however, in HZO they are found in the trigeminal nerve distribution, whereas they are located in a thoracic dermatome in this patient.","bool":false},{"option":"Temporal lobe inflammation","explanation":"\nTemporal lobe inflammation is seen in herpes zoster encephalitis; risk factors for which include immunosuppression and shingles with cranial or cervical dermatomal involvement, two or more prior episodes, or systemic dissemination. Although this patient does have shingles and is immunosuppressed, he has shingles in a thoracic dermatome rather than a cranial or cervical one.","bool":false},{"option":"Urinary retention","explanation":"\nUrinary retention can occur as an extragenital complication of severe primary HSV-2 (or, less commonly, HSV-1) infection with lumbosacral radiculomyelitis. Although the lesions found in genital HSV-2 may manifest as painful vesicles, similar to those of this patient, for HSV-2 they are located on or around the genitals and anus, whereas this patient has vesicles on his right flank (likely a thoracic dermatome). Shingles are caused by varicella-zoster virus rather than HSV, and are not commonly complicated by urinary retention.","bool":false},{"option":"Ascending paralysis","explanation":"Ascending paralysis is characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a postinfectious autoimmune reaction.

In combination with the examination findings, this history suggests a particular chronic blistering skin condition that can be triggered by alcohol consumption and exogenous estrogen use.","answers":[{"option":"Increased urinary uroporphyrin","explanation":"\nIncreased plasma and urine porphyrins are diagnostic of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). PCT is the most common porphyria and typically manifests in adults 40–70 years of age with blistering cutaneous photosensitivity. Skin findings in PCT include hyperpigmentation and scarring (likely due to previous PCT lesions), as seen in this patient, along with hypertrichosis, skin contraction, and calcification of the forehead (resembling scleroderma). Patients also typically have hepatic involvement. PCT may have a hereditary component. This patient's use of endogenous estrogen and alcohol are risk factors for PCT.

However, age of onset is commonly above 60 years of age and patients typically have a prodromal phase characterized by pruritic eczematous, papular, or urticarial lesions. Furthermore, while the bullae in BP may rupture and commonly involve the trunk, extremity flexures, and inguinal folds, the condition is not triggered by exposure to sunlight and, unlike in this patient, the lesions typically resolve without scarring.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated anti-Smith antibodies","explanation":"\nAnti-Smith antibodies are highly specific for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which typically manifests in women 20–40 years of age with a photosensitive rash and has a hereditary component. However, the most common rash in patients with SLE is an erythematous malar rash. Blisters are uncommon, although bullous cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a rare complication of SLE that typically manifests on the upper trunk, extremities, and neck rather than the hands, forearms, and face.","bool":false},{"option":"Elevated anti-varicella-zoster virus antibodies","explanation":"\nAntibodies against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are a diagnostic finding in varicella-zoster virus infection, which can also cause vesicular or bullous lesions (shingles).
